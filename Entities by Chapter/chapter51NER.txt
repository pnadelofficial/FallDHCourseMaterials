The Conquest of Persia, Syria, Egypt, Africa, and Spain, by the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> or Saracens—Empire of the Caliphs, or Successors of Mahomet—State of the Christians, etc.

 632 The revolution of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> had not changed the character of the Arabs: the death of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was the signal of independence; and the hasty structure of his power and religion tottered to its foundations.
 A small and faithful band of his primitive disciples had listened to his eloquence, and shared his distress; had fled with the apostle from the persecution of Mecca, or had received the fugitive in the walls of Medina.
 The increasing myriads, who acknowledged <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> as their king and prophet, had been compelled by his arms, or allured by his prosperity.
 The polytheists were confounded by the simple idea of a solitary and invisible God; the pride of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and <NORP>Jews</NORP> disdained the yoke of a mortal and contemporary legislator.
 The habits of faith and obedience were not sufficiently confirmed; and many of the new converts regretted the venerable antiquity of the law of Moses, or the rites and mysteries of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church; or the idols, the sacrifices, the joyous festivals, of their <NORP>Pagan</NORP> ancestors.
 The jarring interests and hereditary feuds of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> tribes had not yet coalesced in a system of union and subordination; and the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were impatient of the mildest and most salutary laws that curbed their passions, or violated their customs.
 They submitted with reluctance to the religious precepts of the Koran, the abstinence from wine, the fast of the Ramadan, and the daily repetition of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> prayers; and the alms and tithes, which were collected for the treasury of Medina, could be distinguished only by a name from the payment of a perpetual and ignominious tribute.
 The example of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> had excited a spirit of fanaticism or imposture, and several of his rivals presumed to imitate the conduct, and defy the authority, of the living prophet.
 At the head of the fugitives and auxiliaries, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> caliph was reduced to the cities of Mecca, Medina, and Tayef; and perhaps the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> would have restored the idols of the Caaba, if their levity had not been checked by a seasonable reproof.
 After exhorting the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> to confide in the aid of God and his apostle, <PERSON>Abubeker</PERSON> resolved, by a vigorous attack, to prevent the junction of the rebels.
 The women and children were safely lodged in the cavities of the mountains: the warriors, marching under <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> banners, diffused the terror of their arms; and the appearance of a military force revived and confirmed the loyalty of the faithful.
 The inconstant tribes accepted, with humble repentance, the duties of prayer, and fasting, and alms; and, after some examples of success and severity, the most daring apostates fell prostrate before the sword of the Lord and of Caled.
 In the fertile province of Yemanah, (1) between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Persia, in a city not inferior to <GPE>Medina</GPE> itself, a powerful chief (his name was Moseilama) had assumed the character of a prophet, and the tribe of <PERSON>Hanifa</PERSON> listened to his voice.
 A female prophetess was attracted by his reputation; the decencies of words and actions were spurned by these favourites of Heaven; (2) and they employed several days in mystic and amorous converse.
 An obscure sentence of his Koran, or book, is yet extant; (3) and in the pride of his mission, <PERSON>Moseilama</PERSON> condescended to offer a partition of the earth.
 The proposal was answered by <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> with contempt; but the rapid progress of the impostor awakened the fears of his successor: forty thousand <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were assembled under the standard of Caled; and the existence of their faith was resigned to the event of a decisive battle.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> action they were repulsed by the loss of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> hundred men; but the skill and perseverance of their general prevailed; their defeat was avenged by the slaughter of ten thousand infidels; and <PERSON>Moseilama</PERSON> himself was pierced by an <NORP>Aethiopian</NORP> slave with the same javelin which had mortally wounded the uncle of Mahomet.
 The various rebels of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> without a chief or a cause, were speedily suppressed by the power and discipline of the rising monarchy; and the whole nation again professed, and more steadfastly held, the religion of the Koran.
 The ambition of the caliphs provided an immediate exercise for the restless spirit of the Saracens: their valour was united in the prosecution of a holy war; and their enthusiasm was equally confirmed by opposition and victory.
 Character of their caliphs From the rapid conquests of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> a presumption will naturally arise, that the caliphs commanded in person the armies of the faithful, and sought the crown of martyrdom in the foremost ranks of the battle.
 The courage of Abubeker, (4) Omar, (5) and Othman, (6) had indeed been tried in the persecution and wars of the prophet; and the personal assurance of paradise must have taught them to despise the pleasures and dangers of the present world.
 But they ascended the throne in a venerable or mature age; and esteemed the domestic cares of religion and justice the most important duties of a sovereign.
 Except the presence of <PERSON>Omar</PERSON> at the siege of Jerusalem, their longest expeditions were the frequent pilgrimage from <GPE>Medina</GPE> to Mecca; and they calmly received the tidings of victory as they prayed or preached before the sepulchre of the prophet.
 The austere and frugal measure of their lives was the effect of virtue or habit, and the pride of their simplicity insulted the vain magnificence of the kings of the earth.
 When <PERSON>Abubeker</PERSON> assumed the office of caliph, he enjoined his daughter <PERSON>Ayesha</PERSON> to take a strict account of his private patrimony, that it might be evident whether he were enriched or impoverished by the service of the state.
 He thought himself entitled to a stipend of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, with the sufficient maintenance of a single camel and a black slave; but on the Friday of each week he distributed the residue of his own and the public money, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to the most worthy, and then to the most indigent, of the Moslems.
 The remains of his wealth, a coarse garment, and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, were delivered to his successor, who lamented with a modest sigh his own inability to equal such an admirable model.
 Yet the abstinence and humility of <PERSON>Omar</PERSON> were not inferior to the virtues of Abubeker: his food consisted of barley bread or dates; his drink was water; he preached in a gown that was torn or tattered in <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> places; and the <NORP>Persian</NORP> satrap, who paid his homage to the conqueror, found him asleep among the beggars on the steps of the mosch of Medina.
 Oeeconomy is the source of liberality, and the increase of the revenue enabled <PERSON>Omar</PERSON> to establish a just and perpetual reward for the past and present services of the faithful.
 Careless of his own emolument, he assigned to Abbas, the uncle of the prophet, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most ample allowance of twenty-five thousand drachms or pieces of silver.
 Five thousand were allotted to each of the aged warriors, the relics of the field of Beder; and the last and meanest of the companions of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was distinguished by the <DATE>annual</DATE> reward of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand pieces.
 One thousand was the stipend of the veterans who had fought in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> battles against the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Persians; and the decreasing pay, as low as <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> pieces of silver, was adapted to the respective merit and seniority of the soldiers of Omar.
 Under his reign, and that of his predecessor, the conquerors of the <LOC>East</LOC> were the trusty servants of God and the people; the mass of the public treasure was consecrated to the expenses of peace and war; a prudent mixture of justice and bounty maintained the discipline of the Saracens, and they united, by a rare felicity, the despatch and execution of despotism with the equal and frugal maxims of a <NORP>republican</NORP> government.
 The heroic courage of Ali, (7) the consummate prudence of Moawiyah, (8) excited the emulation of their subjects; and the talents which had been exercised in the school of civil discord were more usefully applied to propagate the faith and dominion of the prophet.
 In the sloth and vanity of the palace of Damascus, the succeeding princes of the house of <GPE>Ommiyah</GPE> were alike destitute of the qualifications of statesmen and of saints.
 (9) Yet the spoils of unknown nations were continually laid at the foot of their throne, and the uniform ascent of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> greatness must be ascribed to the spirit of the nation rather than the abilities of their chiefs.
 A large deduction must be allowed for the weakness of their enemies.
 The birth of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was fortunately placed in the most degenerate and disorderly period of the Persians, the Romans, and the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of Europe: the empires of Trajan, or even of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> or Charlemagne, would have repelled the assault of the naked Saracens, and the torrent of fanaticism might have been obscurely lost in the sands of Arabia.
 Their conquests In the victorious days of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, it had been the aim of the senate to confine their councils and legions to a single war, and completely to suppress a <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> enemy before they provoked the hostilities of a second.
 These timid maxims of policy were disdained by the magnanimity or enthusiasm of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> caliphs.
 With the same vigour and success they invaded the successors of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and those of Artaxerxes; and the rival monarchies at the same instant became the prey of an enemy whom they had been so long accustomed to despise.
 In the ten years of the administration of Omar, the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> reduced to his obedience thirty-six thousand cities or castles, destroyed four thousand churches or temples of the unbelievers, and edified fourteen hundred moschs for the exercise of the religion of Mahomet.
 One hundred years after his flight from Mecca, the arms and the reign of his successors extended from <GPE>India</GPE> to the Atlantic Ocean, over the various and distant provinces, which may be comprised under the names of, Under this general division, I shall proceed to unfold these memorable transactions; despatching with brevity the remote and less interesting conquests of the East, and reserving a fuller narrative for those domestic countries which had been included within the pale of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 Yet I must excuse my own defects by a just complaint of the blindness and insufficiency of my guides.
 The Greeks, so loquacious in controversy, have not been anxious to celebrate the triumphs of their enemies.
 (10) After a century of ignorance, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> annals of the <NORP>Mussulmans</NORP> were collected in a great measure from the voice of tradition.
 (11) Among the numerous productions of <LANGUAGE>Arabic</LANGUAGE> and <NORP>Persian</NORP> literature, (12) our interpreters have selected the imperfect sketches of a more recent age.
 (13) The art and genius of history have ever been unknown to the Asiatics;(14) they are ignorant of the laws of criticism; and our monkish chronicle of the same period may be compared to their most popular works, which are never vivified by the spirit of philosophy and freedom.
 The <NORP>Oriental</NORP> library of a <NORP>Frenchman</NORP> (15) would instruct the most learned mufti of the East; and perhaps the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> might not find in a single historian so clear and comprehensive a narrative of their own exploits as that which will be deduced in the ensuing sheets.
