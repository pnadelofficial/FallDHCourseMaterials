Success of Alexius, A.
D.
 1097-1118.
 In a style less grave than that of history, I should perhaps compare the emperor <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> (1) to the jackal, who is said to follow the steps, and to devour the leavings, of the lion.
 Whatever had been his fears and toils in the passage of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade, they were amply recompensed by the subsequent benefits which he derived from the exploits of the Franks.
 His dexterity and vigilance secured their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conquest of Nice; and from this threatening station the <NORP>Turks</NORP> were compelled to evacuate the neighbourhood of Constantinople.
 While the crusaders, with blind valour, advanced into the midland countries of Asia, the crafty <NORP>Greek</NORP> improved the favourable occasion when the emirs of the sea-coast were recalled to the standard of the sultan.
 The <NORP>Turks</NORP> were driven from the Isles of Rhodes and Chios: the cities of <GPE>Ephesu</GPE> and Smyrna, of Sardes, Philadelphia, and Laodicea, were restored to the empire, which <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> enlarged from the <PRODUCT>Hellespont</PRODUCT> to the banks of the Maeander, and the rocky shores of Pamphylia.
 The churches resumed their splendour: the towns were rebuilt and fortified; and the desert country was peopled with colonies of Christians, who were gently removed from the more distant and dangerous frontier.
 In these paternal cares, we may forgive Alexius, if he forgot the deliverance of the holy sepulchre; but, by the Latins, he was stigmatized with the foul reproach of treason and desertion.
 They had sworn fidelity and obedience to his throne; but he had promised to assist their enterprise in person, or, at least, with his troops and treasures: his base retreat dissolved their obligations; and the sword, which had been the instrument of their victory, was the pledge and title of their just independence.
 It does not appear that the emperor attempted to revive his obsolete claims over the kingdom of Jerusalem; (2) but the borders of <PERSON>Cilicia</PERSON> and <GPE>Syria</GPE> were more recent in his possession, and more accessible to his arms.
 The great army of the crusaders was annihilated or dispersed; the principality of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> was left without a head, by the surprise and captivity of Bohemond; his ransom had oppressed him with a heavy debt; and his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> followers were insufficient to repel the hostilities of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Turks.
 In this distress, <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> embraced a magnanimous resolution, of leaving the defence of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> to his kinsman, the faithful Tancred; of arming the <LOC>West</LOC> against the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire; and of executing the design which he inherited from the lessons and example of his father Guiscard.
 His embarkation was clandestine: and, if we may credit a tale of the princess Anne, he passed the hostile sea closely secreted in a coffin.
 (3) But his reception in <GPE>France</GPE> was dignified by the public applause, and his marriage with the king's daughter: his return was glorious, since the bravest spirits of the age enlisted under his veteran command; and he repassed the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> at the head of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse and forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot, assembled from the most remote climates of Europe.
 (4) The strength of Durazzo, and prudence of Alexius, the progress of famine and approach of winter, eluded his ambitious hopes; and the venal confederates were seduced from his standard.
 A treaty of peace (5) suspended the fears of the Greeks; and they were finally delivered by the death of an adversary, whom neither oaths could bind, nor dangers could appal, nor prosperity could satiate.
 His children succeeded to the principality of Antioch; but the boundaries were strictly defined, the homage was clearly stipulated, and the cities of <GPE>Tarsus</GPE> and <GPE>Malmistra</GPE> were restored to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> emperors.
 Of the coast of Anatolia, they possessed the entire circuit from <GPE>Trebizond</GPE> to the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> gates.
 The <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> dynasty of <PERSON>Roum</PERSON> (6) was separated on all sides from the sea and their <PERSON>Mussulman</PERSON> brethren; the power of the sultan was shaken by the victories and even the defeats of the Franks; and after the loss of Nice, they removed their throne to <PERSON>Cogni</PERSON> or Iconium, an obscure and in land town above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles from Constantinople.
 (7) Instead of trembling for their capital, the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> princes waged an offensive war against the Turks, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade prevented the fall of the declining empire.
 Expeditions by land:.
 In the twelfth century, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> great emigrations marched by land from the <LOC>West</LOC> for the relief of Palestine.
 the first, A.
D.
 1101.
 The soldiers and pilgrims of Lombardy, France, and <GPE>Germany</GPE> were excited by the example and success of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade.
 (8) the second, of <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> III.
 And <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> VII.
, A.
D.
 1147.
 Forty-eight <DATE>years</DATE> after the deliverance of the holy sepulchre, the emperor, and the <NORP>French</NORP> king, <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> and <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the Seventh, undertook the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> crusade to support the falling fortunes of the Latins.
 (9) the third, of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> I.
, A.
D.
 1189.
 A grand division of the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> crusade was led by the emperor <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, (10) who sympathized with his brothers of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>England</GPE> in the common loss of Jerusalem.
 These <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> expeditions may be compared in their resemblance of the greatness of numbers, their passage through the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire, and the nature and event of their <NORP>Turkish</NORP> warfare, and a brief parallel may save the repetition of a tedious narrative.
 However splendid it may seem, a regular story of the crusades would exhibit the perpetual return of the same causes and effects; and the frequent attempts for the defence or recovery of the Holy Land would appear so many faint and unsuccessful copies of the original.
 Their numbers.
 I.
 Of the swarms that so closely trod in the footsteps of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> pilgrims, the chiefs were equal in rank, though unequal in fame and merit, to <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> and his fellow-adventurers.
 At their head were displayed the banners of the dukes of Burgundy, Bavaria, and Aquitain; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> a descendant of Hugh Capet, the second, a father of the <GPE>Brunswick</GPE> line: the archbishop of Milan, a temporal prince, transported, for the benefit of the Turks, the treasures and ornaments of his church and palace; and the veteran crusaders, Hugh the Great and Stephen of Chartres, returned to consummate their unfinished vow.
 The huge and disorderly bodies of their followers moved forward in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns; and if the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> consisted of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> persons, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> might possibly amount to sixty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot.
 (11) The armies of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> crusade might have claimed the conquest of Asia; the nobles of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>Germany</GPE> were animated by the presence of their sovereigns; and both the rank and personal character of <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> and <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> gave a dignity to their cause, and a discipline to their force, which might be vainly expected from the feudatory chiefs.
 The cavalry of the emperor, and that of the king, was each composed of seventy <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> knights, and their immediate attendants in the field; (12) and if the light-armed troops, the peasant infantry, the women and children, the priests and monks, be rigorously excluded, the full account will scarcely be satisfied with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> souls.
 The West, from <GPE>Rome</GPE> to Britain, was called into action; the kings of <GPE>Poland</GPE> and <GPE>Bohemia</GPE> obeyed the summons of Conrad; and it is affirmed by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, that, in the passage of a strait or river, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> agents, after a tale of nine <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand, desisted from the endless and formidable computation.
 (13) In the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> crusade, as the <NORP>French</NORP> and <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> preferred the navigation of the Mediterranean, the host of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> <PERSON>Barbarossa</PERSON> was less numerous.
 Fifteen <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> knights, and as many squires, were the flower of the <NORP>German</NORP> chivalry: sixty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot, were mustered by the emperor in the plains of Hungary; and after such repetitions, we shall no longer be startled at the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pilgrims, which credulity has ascribed to this last emigration.
 (14) Such extravagant reckonings prove only the astonishment of contemporaries; but their astonishment most strongly bears testimony to the existence of an enormous, though indefinite, multitude.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> might applaud their superior knowledge of the arts and stratagems of war, but they confessed the strength and courage of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry, and the infantry of the Germans; (15) and the strangers are described as an iron race, of gigantic stature, who darted fire from their eyes, and spilt blood like water on the ground.
 Under the banners of Conrad, a troop of females rode in the attitude and armour of men; and the chief of these Amazons, from her gilt spurs and buskins, obtained the epithet of the Golden-footed Dame.
 <ORG>Passage</ORG> through the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire.
 II.
 The number and character of the strangers was an object of terror to the effeminate Greeks, and the sentiment of fear is nearly allied to that of hatred.
 This aversion was suspended or softened by the apprehension of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> power; and the invectives of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> will not bias our more candid belief, that the emperor <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> dissembled their insolence, eluded their hostilities, counselled their rashness, and opened to their ardour the road of pilgrimage and conquest.
 But when the <NORP>Turks</NORP> had been driven from <GPE>Nice</GPE> and the sea-coast, when the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> princes no longer dreaded the distant sultans of Cogni, they felt with purer indignation the free and frequent passage of the western Barbarians, who violated the majesty, and endangered the safety, of the empire.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> crusades were undertaken under the reign of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> Comnenus and Isaac Angelus.
 Of the former, the passions were always impetuous, and often malevolent; and the natural union of a cowardly and a mischievous temper was exemplified in the latter, who, without merit or mercy, could punish a tyrant, and occupy his throne.
 It was secretly, and perhaps tacitly, resolved by the prince and people to destroy, or at least to discourage, the pilgrims, by every species of injury and oppression; and their want of prudence and discipline continually afforded the pretence or the opportunity.
 The <NORP>Western</NORP> monarchs had stipulated a safe passage and fair market in the country of their <NORP>Christian</NORP> brethren; the treaty had been ratified by oaths and hostages; and the poorest soldier of Frederic's army was furnished with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> marks of silver to defray his expenses on the road.
 But every engagement was violated by treachery and injustice; and the complaints of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> are attested by the honest confession of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> historian, who has dared to prefer truth to his country.
 (16) Instead of a hospitable reception, the gates of the cities, both in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, were closely barred against the crusaders; and the scanty pittance of food was let down in baskets from the walls.
 Experience or foresight might excuse this timid jealousy; but the common duties of humanity prohibited the mixture of chalk, or other poisonous ingredients, in the bread; and should <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> be acquitted of any foul connivance, he is guilty of coining base money for the purpose of trading with the pilgrims.
 In every step of their march they were stopped or misled: the governors had private orders to fortify the passes and break down the bridges against them: the stragglers were pillaged and murdered: the soldiers and horses were pierced in the woods by arrows from an invisible hand; the sick were burnt in their beds; and the dead bodies were hung on gibbets along the highways.
 These injuries exasperated the champions of the cross, who were not endowed with evangelical patience; and the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> princes, who had provoked the unequal conflict, promoted the embarkation and march of these formidable guests.
 On the verge of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> frontier <PERSON>Barbarossa</PERSON> spared the guilty Philadelphia, (17) rewarded the hospitable Laodicea, and deplored the hard necessity that had stained his sword with any drops of <NORP>Christian</NORP> blood.
 In their intercourse with the monarchs of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and France, the pride of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was exposed to an anxious trial.
 They might boast that on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> interview the seat of <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> was a low stool, beside the throne of Manuel; (18) but no sooner had the <NORP>French</NORP> king transported his army beyond the Bosphorus, than he refused the offer of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> conference, unless his brother would meet him on equal terms, either on the sea or land.
 With <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> and Frederic, the ceremonial was still nicer and more difficult: like the successors of Constantine, they styled themselves emperors of the Romans; (19) and firmly maintained the purity of their title and dignity.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these representatives of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> would only converse with <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> on horseback in the open field; the second, by passing the <PRODUCT>Hellespont</PRODUCT> rather than the Bosphorus, declined the view of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and its sovereign.
 An emperor, who had been crowned at Rome, was reduced in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> epistles to the humble appellation of Rex, or prince, of the Alemanni; and the vain and feeble <PERSON>Angelus</PERSON> affected to be ignorant of the name of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the greatest men and monarchs of the age.
 While they viewed with hatred and suspicion the <NORP>Latin</NORP> pilgrims the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors maintained a strict, though secret, alliance with the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Saracens.
 Isaac <PERSON>Angelus</PERSON> complained, that by his friendship for the great <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> he had incurred the enmity of the Franks; and a mosque was founded at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> for the public exercise of the religion of Mahomet.
 (20) <NORP>Turkish</NORP> warfare.
 III.
 The swarms that followed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade were destroyed in <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> by famine, pestilence, and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> arrows; and the princes only escaped with some squadrons of horse to accomplish their lamentable pilgrimage.
 A just opinion may be formed of their knowledge and humanity; of their knowledge, from the design of subduing <LOC>Persia</LOC> and <NORP>Chorasan</NORP> in their way to Jerusalem; of their humanity, from the massacre of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> people, a friendly city, who came out to meet them with palms and crosses in their hands.
 The arms of <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> and <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> were less cruel and imprudent; but the event of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> crusade was still more ruinous to Christendom; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> is accused by his own subjects of giving seasonable intelligence to the sultan, and treacherous guides to the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes.
 Instead of crushing the common foe, by a double attack at the same time but on different sides, the <NORP>Germans</NORP> were urged by emulation, and the <NORP>French</NORP> were retarded by jealousy.
 <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> had scarcely passed the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> when he was met by the returning emperor, who had lost the greater part of his army in glorious, but unsuccessful, actions on the banks of the Maender.
 The contrast of the pomp of his rival hastened the retreat of Conrad: the desertion of his independent vassals reduced him to his hereditary troops; and he borrowed some <NORP>Greek</NORP> vessels to execute by sea the pilgrimage of Palestine.
 Without studying the lessons of experience, or the nature of the war, the king of <GPE>France</GPE> advanced through the same country to a similar fate.
 The vanguard, which bore the royal banner and the oriflamme of St.
 Denys, (21) had doubled their march with rash and inconsiderate speed; and the rear, which the king commanded in person, no longer found their companions in the evening camp.
 In darkness and disorder, they were encompassed, assaulted, and overwhelmed, by the innumerable host of Turks, who, in the art of war, were superior to the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of the twelfth century.
 Louis, who climbed a tree in the general discomfiture, was saved by his own valour and the ignorance of his adversaries; and with the dawn of <DATE>day</DATE> he escaped alive, but almost alone, to the camp of the vanguard.
 But instead of pursuing his expedition by land, he was rejoiced to shelter the relics of his army in the friendly seaport of Satalia.
 From thence he embarked for Antioch; but so penurious was the supply of <NORP>Greek</NORP> vessels, that they could only afford room for his knights and nobles; and the plebeian crowd of infantry was left to perish at the foot of the Pamphylian hills.
 The emperor and the king embraced and wept at Jerusalem; their martial trains, the remnant of mighty armies, were joined to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> powers of Syria, and a fruitless siege of <GPE>Damascus</GPE> was the final effort of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> crusade.
 <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> and <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> embarked for <LOC>Europe</LOC> with the personal fame of piety and courage; but the <PERSON>Orientals</PERSON> had braved these potent monarchs of the Franks, with whose names and military forces they had been so often threatened.
 (22) Perhaps they had still more to fear from the veteran genius of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the First, who in his youth had served in <LOC>Asia</LOC> under his uncle Conrad.
 <CARDINAL>Forty</CARDINAL> campaigns in <GPE>Germany</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> had taught <PERSON>Barbarossa</PERSON> to command; and his soldiers, even the princes of the empire, were accustomed under his reign to obey.
 As soon as he lost sight of <GPE>Philadelphia</GPE> and Laodicea, the last cities of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> frontier, he plunged into the salt and barren desert, a land (says the historian) of horror and tribulation.
 (23) During twenty days, every step of his fainting and sickly march was besieged by the innumerable hordes of Turkmans, (24) whose numbers and fury seemed after each defeat to multiply and inflame.
 The emperor continued to struggle and to suffer; and such was the measure of his calamities, that when he reached the gates of Iconium, no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> knights were able to serve on horseback.
 By a sudden and resolute assault he defeated the guards, and stormed the capital of the sultan, (25) who humbly sued for pardon and peace.
 The road was now open, and <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> advanced in a career of triumph, till he was unfortunately drowned in a petty torrent of Cilicia.
 (26) The remainder of his <NORP>Germans</NORP> was consumed by sickness and desertion: and the emperor's son expired with the greatest part of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> vassals at the siege of Acre.
 Among the <NORP>Latin</NORP> heroes, <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> and <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> <PERSON>Barbarossa</PERSON> could alone achieve the passage of the Lesser Asia; yet even their success was a warning; and in the last and most experienced age of the crusades, every nation preferred the sea to the toils and perils of an inland expedition.
 (27) Obstinacy of the enthusiasm of the crusades.
 The enthusiasm of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade is a natural and simple event, while hope was fresh, danger untried, and enterprise congenial to the spirit of the times.
 But the obstinate perseverance of <LOC>Europe</LOC> may indeed excite our pity and admiration; that no instruction should have been drawn from constant and adverse experience; that the same confidence should have repeatedly grown from the same failures; that <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> succeeding generations should have rushed headlong down the precipice that was open before them; and that men of every condition should have staked their public and private fortunes on the desperate adventure of possessing or recovering a tombstone <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> miles from their country.
 In a period of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> centuries after the council of Clermont, each spring and summer produced a new emigration of pilgrim warriors for the defence of the Holy Land; but the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> great armaments or crusades were excited by some impending or recent calamity: the nations were moved by the authority of their pontiffs, and the example of their kings: their zeal was kindled, and their reason was silenced, by the voice of their holy orators; Character and mission of St.
 Bernard, A.
D.
 1091-1153.
 and among these, Bernard, (28) the monk, or the saint, may claim the most honourable place.
 About eight <DATE>years</DATE> before the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conquest of Jerusalem, he was born of a noble family in Burgundy; at the age of <DATE>three-and-twenty</DATE> he buried himself in the monastery of Citeaux, then in the primitive fervour of the institution; at the end of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> he led forth her <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> colony, or daughter, to the valley of <GPE>Clairvaux</GPE> (29) in Champagne; and was content, till the hour of his death, with the humble station of abbot of his own community.
 A philosophic age has abolished, with too liberal and indiscriminate disdain, the honours of these spiritual heroes.
 The meanest among them are distinguished by some energies of the mind; they were at least superior to their votaries and disciples; and, in the race of superstition, they attained the prize for which such numbers contended.
 In speech, in writing, in action, <PERSON>Bernard</PERSON> stood high above his rivals and contemporaries; his compositions are not devoid of wit and eloquence; and he seems to have preserved as much reason and humanity as may be reconciled with the character of a saint.
 In a secular life, he would have shared the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> part of a private inheritance; by a vow of poverty and penance, by closing his eyes against the visible world, (30) by the refusal of all ecclesiastical dignities, the abbot of <GPE>Clairvaux</GPE> became the oracle of Europe, and the founder of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty convents.
 Princes and pontiffs trembled at the freedom of his apostolical censures: France, England, and Milan, consulted and obeyed his judgment in a schism of the church: the debt was repaid by the gratitude of <PERSON>Innocent</PERSON> the Second; and his successor, <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> the Third, was the friend and disciple of the holy Bernard.
 It was in the proclamation of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> crusade that he shone as the missionary and prophet of God, who called the nations to the defence of his holy sepulchre.
 (31) At the parliament of <GPE>Vezelay</GPE> he spoke before the king; and <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the Seventh, with his nobles, received their crosses from his hand.
 The abbot of <GPE>Clairvaux</GPE> then marched to the less easy conquest of the emperor Conrad: a phlegmatic people, ignorant of his language, was transported by the pathetic vehemence of his tone and gestures; and his progress, from <PERSON>Constance</PERSON> to Cologne, was the triumph of eloquence and zeal.
 <PERSON>Bernard</PERSON> applauds his own success in the depopulation of Europe; affirms that cities and castles were emptied of their inhabitants; and computes, that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> man was left behind for the consolation of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> widows.
 (32) The blind fanatics were desirous of electing him for their general; but the example of the hermit <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> was before his eyes; and while he assured the crusaders of the divine favour, he prudently declined a military command, in which failure and victory would have been almost equally disgraceful to his character.
 (33) Yet, after the calamitous event, the abbot of <GPE>Clairvaux</GPE> was loudly accused as a false prophet, the author of the public and private mourning; his enemies exulted, his friends blushed, and his apology was slow and unsatisfactory.
 He justifies his obedience to the commands of the pope; expatiates on the mysterious ways of Providence; imputes the misfortunes of the pilgrims to their own sins; and modestly insinuates, that his mission had been approved by signs and wonders.
 (34) Had the fact been certain, the argument would be decisive; and his faithful disciples, who enumerate twenty or <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> miracles in a day, appeal to the public assemblies of <GPE>France</GPE> and Germany, in which they were performed.
 (35) At the present hour, such prodigies will not obtain credit beyond the precincts of Clairvaux; but in the preternatural cures of the blind, the lame, and the sick, who were presented to the man of God, it is impossible for us to ascertain the separate shares of accident, of fancy, of imposture, and of fiction.
 Progress of the Mahometans.
 <ORG>Omnipotence</ORG> itself cannot escape the murmurs of its discordant votaries; since the same dispensation which was applauded as a deliverance in Europe, was deplored, and perhaps arraigned, as a calamity in Asia.
 After the loss of Jerusalem, the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> fugitives diffused their consternation and sorrow; <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> mourned in the dust; the cadhi <PERSON>Zeineddin</PERSON> of <GPE>Damascus</GPE> tore his beard in the caliph's presence; and the whole divan shed tears at his melancholy tale.
 (36) But the commanders of the faithful could only weep; they were themselves captives in the hands of the Turks: some temporal power was restored to the last age of the Abbassides; but their humble ambition was confined to <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> and the adjacent province.
 Their tyrants, the <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> sultans, had followed the common law of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> dynasties, the unceasing round of valour, greatness, discord, degeneracy, and decay; their spirit and power were unequal to the defence of religion; and, in his distant realm of Persia, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> were strangers to the name and the arms of Sangiar, the last hero of his race.
 (37) While the sultans were involved in the silken web of the harem, the pious task was undertaken by their slaves, The <NORP>Atabeks</NORP> of Syria.
 the Atabeks, (38) a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> name, which, like the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> patricians, may be translated by Father of the Prince.
 Ascansar, a valiant Turk, had been the favourite of Malek Shaw, from whom he received the privilege of standing on the right hand of the throne; but, in the civil wars that ensued on the monarch's death, he lost his head and the government of Aleppo.
 Zenghi, A.
D.
 1127-1145.
 His domestic emirs persevered in their attachment to his son Zenghi, who proved his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> in the defeat of Antioch: <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> campaigns in the service of the caliph and sultan established his military fame; and he was invested with the command of Mosul, as the only champion that could avenge the cause of the prophet.
 The public hope was not disappointed: after a siege of twenty-five days, he stormed the city of Edessa, and recovered from the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> their conquests beyond the Euphrates: (39) the martial tribes of <GPE>Curdistan</GPE> were subdued by the independent sovereign of <GPE>Mosul</GPE> and Aleppo: his soldiers were taught to behold the camp as their only country; they trusted to his liberality for their rewards; and their absent families were protected by the vigilance of Zenghi.
 Noureddin, A.
D.
 1145-1174.
 At the head of these veterans, his son <PERSON>Noureddin</PERSON> gradually united the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> powers; added the kingdom of <GPE>Damascus</GPE> to that of Aleppo, and waged a long and successful war against the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of Syria; he spread his ample reign from the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> to the Nile, and the <PRODUCT>Abbassides</PRODUCT> rewarded their faithful servant with all the titles and prerogatives of royalty.
 The <NORP>Latins</NORP> themselves were compelled to own the wisdom and courage, and even the justice and piety, of this implacable adversary.
 (40) In his life and government the holy warrior revived the zeal and simplicity of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> caliphs.
 Gold and silk were banished from his palace; the use of wine from his dominions; the public revenue was scrupulously applied to the public service; and the frugal household of <PERSON>Noureddin</PERSON> was maintained from his legitimate share of the spoil which he vested in the purchase of a private estate.
 His favourite sultana sighed for some female object of expense.
 His chamber of justice was the terror of the great and the refuge of the poor.
 Some <DATE>years</DATE> after the sultan's death, an oppressed subject called aloud in the streets of Damascus, A tumult was apprehended, and a living tyrant blushed or trembled at the name of a departed monarch.
Conquest of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> by the Turks, A.
D.
 1163-1169.
 By the arms of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Franks, the <NORP>Fatimites</NORP> had been deprived of Syria.
 In <GPE>Egypt</GPE> the decay of their character and influence was still more essential.
 Yet they were still revered as the descendants and successors of the prophet; they maintained their invisible state in the palace of Cairo; and their person was seldom violated by the profane eyes of subjects or strangers.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> ambassadors (41) have described their own introduction, through a series of gloomy passages, and glittering porticos: the scene was enlivened by the warbling of birds and the murmur of fountains: it was enriched by a display of rich furniture and rare animals; of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> treasures, something was shown, and much was supposed; and the long order of unfolding doors was guarded by black soldiers and domestic eunuchs.
 The sanctuary of the presence chamber was veiled with a curtain; and the vizier, who conducted the ambassadors, laid aside the cimeter, and prostrated himself <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> times on the ground; the veil was then removed; and they beheld the commander of the faithful, who signified his pleasure to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> slave of the throne.
 But this slave was his master: the viziers or sultans had usurped the supreme administration of Egypt; the claims of the rival candidates were decided by arms; and the name of the most worthy, of the strongest, was inserted in the royal patent of command.
 The factions of <PERSON>Dargham</PERSON> and <PERSON>Shawer</PERSON> alternately expelled each other from the capital and country; and the weaker side implored the dangerous protection of the sultan of Damascus, or the king of Jerusalem, the perpetual enemies of the sect and monarchy of the Fatimites.
 By his arms and religion the <NORP>Turk</NORP> was most formidable; but the Frank, in an easy, direct march, could advance from <GPE>Gaza</GPE> to the Nile; while the intermediate situation of his realm compelled the troops of <PERSON>Noureddin</PERSON> to wheel round the skirts of Arabia, a long and painful circuit, which exposed them to thirst, fatigue, and the burning winds of the desert.
 The secret zeal and ambition of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> prince aspired to reign in <GPE>Egypt</GPE> under the name of the Abbassides; but the restoration of the suppliant <PERSON>Shawer</PERSON> was the ostensible motive of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> expedition; and the success was entrusted to the emir Shiracouh, a valiant and veteran commander.
 <PERSON>Dargham</PERSON> was oppressed and slain; but the ingratitude, the jealousy, the just apprehensions, of his more fortunate rival, soon provoked him to invite the king of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> to deliver <GPE>Egypt</GPE> from his insolent benefactors.
 To this union the forces of <GPE>Shiracouh</GPE> were unequal: he relinquished the premature conquest; and the evacuation of <GPE>Belbeis</GPE> or <GPE>Pelusium</GPE> was the condition of his safe retreat.
 As the <NORP>Turks</NORP> defiled before the enemy, and their general closed the rear, with a vigilant eye, and a battle axe in his hand, a <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> presumed to ask him if he were not afraid of an attack.
 His report of the riches of the land, the effeminacy of the natives, and the disorders of the government, revived the hopes of Noureddin; the caliph of <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> applauded the pious design; and <GPE>Shiracouh</GPE> descended into <GPE>Egypt</GPE> a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time with <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Turks</NORP> and eleven <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Arabs.
 Yet his forces were still inferior to the confederate armies of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Saracens; and I can discern an unusual degree of military art, in his passage of the Nile, his retreat into Thebais, his masterly evolutions in the battle of Babain, the surprise of Alexandria, and his marches and countermarches in the flats and valley of Egypt, from the tropic to the sea.
 His conduct was seconded by the courage of his troops, and on the eve of action a <PERSON>Mamaluke</PERSON> (42) exclaimed, Yet, after all his efforts in the field, (43) after the obstinate defence of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> (44) by his nephew Saladin, an honourable capitulation and retreat concluded the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> enterprise of Shiracouh; and <PERSON>Noureddin</PERSON> reserved his abilities for a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> and more propitious occasion.
 It was soon offered by the ambition and avarice of <PERSON>Amalric</PERSON> or Amaury, king of Jerusalem, who had imbibed the pernicious maxim, that no faith should be kept with the enemies of God.
 A religious warrior, the great master of the hospital, encouraged him to proceed; the emperor of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> either gave, or promised, a fleet to act with the armies of Syria; and the perfidious Christian, unsatisfied with spoil and subsidy, aspired to the conquest of Egypt.
 In this emergency, the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> turned their eyes towards the sultan of Damascus; the vizier, whom danger encompassed on all sides, yielded to their unanimous wishes, and <PERSON>Noureddin</PERSON> seemed to be tempted by the fair offer of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the revenue of the kingdom.
 The <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> were already at the gates of Cairo; but the suburbs, the old city, were burnt on their approach; they were deceived by an insidious negotiation, and their vessels were unable to surmount the barriers of the Nile.
 They prudently declined a contest with the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in the midst of a hostile country; and <PERSON>Amaury</PERSON> retired into <GPE>Palestine</GPE> with the shame and reproach that always adhere to unsuccessful injustice.
 After this deliverance, <GPE>Shiracouh</GPE> was invested with a robe of honour, which he soon stained with the blood of the unfortunate Shawer.
 For a while, the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> emirs condescended to hold the office of vizier; but this foreign conquest precipitated the fall of the <NORP>Fatimites</NORP> themselves; and the bloodless change was accomplished by a message and a word.
 The caliphs had been degraded by their own weakness and the tyranny of the viziers: their subjects blushed, when the descendant and successor of the prophet presented his naked hand to the rude gripe of a <NORP>Latin</NORP> ambassador; they wept when he sent the hair of his women, a sad emblem of their grief and terror, to excite the pity of the sultan of Damascus.
 End of the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliphs, A.
D.
 1171.
 By the command of Noureddin, and the sentence of the doctors, the holy names of Abubeker, Omar, and Othman, were solemnly restored: the caliph Mosthadi, of Bagdad, was acknowledged in the public prayers as the true commander of the faithful; and the green livery of the sons of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> was exchanged for the black colour of the Abbassides.
 The last of his race, the caliph Adhed, who survived only <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days, expired in happy ignorance of his fate; his treasures secured the loyalty of the soldiers, and silenced the murmurs of the sectaries; and in all subsequent revolutions, <GPE>Egypt</GPE> has never departed from the orthodox tradition of the Moslems.
 (45) Reign and character of Saladin, A.
D.
 1171-1193.
 The hilly country beyond the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> is occupied by the pastoral tribes of the Curds; (46) a people hardy, strong, savage impatient of the yoke, addicted to rapine, and tenacious of the government of their national chiefs.
 The resemblance of name, situation, and manners, seems to identify them with the <NORP>Carduchians</NORP> of the Greeks; (47) and they still defend against the Ottoman Porte the antique freedom which they asserted against the successors of Cyrus.
 Poverty and ambition prompted them to embrace the profession of mercenary soldiers: the service of his father and uncle prepared the reign of the great Saladin; (48) and the son of <PERSON>Job</PERSON> or Ayud, a simple Curd, magnanimously smiled at his pedigree, which flattery deduced from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> caliphs.
 (49) So unconscious was <PERSON>Noureddin</PERSON> of the impending ruin of his house, that he constrained the reluctant youth to follow his uncle <GPE>Shiracouh</GPE> into Egypt: his military character was established by the defence of Alexandria; and, if we may believe the Latins, he solicited and obtained from the <NORP>Christian</NORP> general the profane honours of knighthood.
 (50) On the death of Shiracouh, the office of grand vizier was bestowed on Saladin, as the youngest and least powerful of the emirs; but with the advice of his father, whom he invited to Cairo, his genius obtained the ascendant over his equals, and attached the army to his person and interest.
 While <PERSON>Noureddin</PERSON> lived, these ambitious <PERSON>Curds</PERSON> were the most humble of his slaves; and the indiscreet murmurs of the divan were silenced by the prudent Ayub, who loudly protested that at the command of the sultan he himself would lead his sons in chains to the foot of the throne.
 His seasonable death relieved them from the odious and doubtful conflict: his son, a minor of eleven <DATE>years</DATE> of age, was left for a while to the emirs of Damascus; and the new lord of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> was decorated by the caliph with every title (51) that could sanctify his usurpation in the eyes of the people.
 Nor was <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> long content with the possession of Egypt; he despoiled the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of Jerusalem, and the <NORP>Atabeks</NORP> of Damascus, Aleppo, and Diarbekir: <GPE>Mecca</GPE> and <GPE>Medina</GPE> acknowledged him for their temporal protector: his brother subdued the distant regions of Yemen, or the happy Arabia; and at the hour of his death, his empire was spread from the <NORP>African</NORP> <GPE>Tripoli</GPE> to the Tigris, and from the Indian <LOC>Ocean</LOC> to the mountains of Armenia.
 In the judgment of his character, the reproaches of treason and ingratitude strike forcibly on our minds, impressed, as they are, with the principle and experience of law and loyalty.
 But his ambition may in some measure be excused by the revolutions of Asia, (52) which had erased every notion of legitimate succession; by the recent example of the <NORP>Atabeks</NORP> themselves; by his reverence to the son of his benefactor; his humane and generous behavior to the collateral branches; by their incapacity and his merit; by the approbation of the caliph, the sole source of all legitimate power; and, above all, by the wishes and interest of the people, whose happiness is the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> object of government.
 In his virtues, and in those of his patron, they admired the singular union of the hero and the saint; for both <PERSON>Noureddin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> are ranked among the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> saints; and the constant meditation of the holy war appears to have shed a serious and sober colour over their lives and actions.
 The youth of the latter (53) was addicted to wine and women: but his aspiring spirit soon renounced the temptations of pleasure for the graver follies of fame and dominion: the garment of <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> was of coarse woollen; water was his only drink; and, while he emulated the temperance, he surpassed the chastity, of his <NORP>Arabian</NORP> prophet.
 Both in faith and practice he was a rigid Mussulman: he ever deplored that the defence of religion had not allowed him to accomplish the pilgrimage of Mecca; but at the stated hours, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times each day, the sultan devoutly prayed with his brethren: the involuntary omission of fasting was scrupulously repaid; and his perusal of the Koran, on horseback between the approaching armies, may be quoted as a proof, however ostentatious, of piety and courage.
 (54) The superstitious doctrine of the sect of <PERSON>Shafei</PERSON> was the only study that he deigned to encourage: the poets were safe in his contempt; but all profane science was the object of his aversion; and a philosopher, who had invented some speculative novelties, was seized and strangled by the command of the royal saint.
 The justice of his divan was accessible to the meanest suppliant against himself and his ministers; and it was only for a kingdom that <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> would deviate from the rule of equity.
 While the descendants of <PERSON>Seljuk</PERSON> and <PERSON>Zenghi</PERSON> held his stirrup and smoothed his garments, he was affable and patient with the meanest of his servants.
 So boundless was his liberality, that he distributed <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horses at the siege of Acre; and, at the time of his death, no more than <CARDINAL>forty-seven</CARDINAL> drams of silver and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> piece of gold coin were found in the treasury; yet, in a martial reign, the tributes were diminished, and the wealthy citizens enjoyed, without fear or danger, the fruits of their industry.
 Egypt, Syria, and Arabia, were adorned by the royal foundations of hospitals, colleges, and mosques; and <GPE>Cairo</GPE> was fortified with a wall and citadel; but his works were consecrated to public use: (55) nor did the sultan indulge himself in a garden or palace of private luxury.
 In a fanatic age, himself a fanatic, the genuine virtues of <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> commanded the esteem of the Christians; the emperor of <GPE>Germany</GPE> gloried in his friendship; (56) the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor solicited his alliance; (57) and the conquest of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> diffused, and perhaps magnified, his fame both in the <LOC>East</LOC> and West.
 His conquest of the kingdom, A.
D.
 1187, <DATE>July</DATE> 3.
 During his short existence, the kingdom of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> (58) was supported by the discord of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Saracens; and both the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliphs and the sultans of <GPE>Damascus</GPE> were tempted to sacrifice the cause of their religion to the meaner considerations of private and present advantage.
 But the powers of Egypt, Syria, and Arabia, were now united by a hero, whom nature and fortune had armed against the Christians.
 All without now bore the most threatening aspect; and all was feeble and hollow in the internal state of Jerusalem.
 After the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Baldwins, the brother and cousin of <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of Bouillon, the sceptre devolved by female succession to Melisenda, daughter of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Baldwin, and her husband Fulk, count of Anjou, the father, by a former marriage, of our <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> Plantagenets.
 Their <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> the Third, and Amaury, waged a strenuous, and not unsuccessful, war against the infidels; but the son of Amaury, <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> the Fourth, was deprived, by the leprosy, a gift of the crusades, of the faculties both of mind and body.
 His sister Sybilla, the mother of <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> the Fifth, was his natural heiress: after the suspicious death of her child, she crowned her <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> husband, Guy of Lusignan, a prince of a handsome person, but of such base renown, that his own brother <PERSON>Jeffrey</PERSON> was heard to exclaim,The choice was generally blamed; and the most powerful vassal, <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> count of Tripoli, who had been excluded from the succession and regency, entertained an implacable hatred against the king, and exposed his honour and conscience to the temptations of the sultan.
 Such were the guardians of the holy city; a leper, a child, a woman, a coward, and a traitor: yet its fate was delayed <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> by some supplies from Europe, by the valour of the military orders, and by the distant or domestic avocations of their great enemy.
 At length, on every side, the sinking state was encircled and pressed by a hostile line: and the truce was violated by the Franks, whose existence it protected.
 A soldier of fortune, <PERSON>Reginald</PERSON> of Chatillon, had seized a fortress on the edge of the desert, from whence he pillaged the caravans, insulted Mahomet, and threatened the cities of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> and Medina.
 <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> condescended to complain; rejoiced in the denial of justice, and at the head of fourscore <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse and foot invaded the Holy Land.
 The choice of <GPE>Tiberias</GPE> for his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> siege was suggested by the count of Tripoli, to whom it belonged; and the king of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> was persuaded to drain his garrison, and to arm his people, for the relief of that important place.
 (59) By the advice of the perfidious Raymond, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> were betrayed into a camp destitute of water: he fled on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, with the curses of both nations: (60) <PERSON>Lusignan</PERSON> was overthrown, with the loss of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men; and the wood of the true cross (a dire misfortune!) was left in the power of the infidels.
 The royal captive was conducted to the tent of Saladin; and as he fainted with thirst and terror, the generous victor presented him with a cup of sherbet, cooled in snow, without suffering his companion, <PERSON>Reginald</PERSON> of Chatillon, to partake of this pledge of hospitality and pardon.
 On the proud or conscientious refusal of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> warrior, <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> struck him on the head with his cimeter, and <PERSON>Reginald</PERSON> was despatched by the guards.
 (61) The trembling <PERSON>Lusignan</PERSON> was sent to Damascus, to an honourable prison and speedy ransom; but the victory was stained by the execution of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> knights of the hospital, the intrepid champions and martyrs of their faith.
 The kingdom was left without a head; and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> grand masters of the military orders, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> was slain and the other was a prisoner.
 From all the cities, both of the sea-coast and the inland country, the garrisons had been drawn away for this fatal field: <GPE>Tyre</GPE> and <GPE>Tripoli</GPE> alone could escape the rapid inroad of Saladin; and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <DATE>months</DATE> after the battle of Tiberias, he appeared in arms before the gates of Jerusalem.
 (62) and city of Jerusalem, A.
D.
 1187, October 2.
 He might expect that the siege of a city so venerable on earth and in heaven, so interesting to <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, would rekindle the last sparks of enthusiasm; and that, of sixty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Christians, every man would be a soldier, and every soldier a candidate for martyrdom.
 But Queen <PERSON>Sybilla</PERSON> trembled for herself and her captive husband; and the barons and knights, who had escaped from the sword and chains of the Turks, displayed the same factious and selfish spirit in the public ruin.
 The most numerous portion of the inhabitants was composed of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Oriental</NORP> Christians, whom experience had taught to prefer the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> before the <NORP>Latin</NORP> yoke; (63) and the holy sepulchre attracted a base and needy crowd, without arms or courage, who subsisted only on the charity of the pilgrims.
 Some feeble and hasty efforts were made for the defence of Jerusalem: but in the space of fourteen days, a victorious army drove back the sallies of the besieged, planted their engines, opened the wall to the breadth of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> cubits, applied their scaling-ladders, and erected on the breach <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> banners of the prophet and the sultan.
 It was in vain that a barefoot procession of the queen, the women, and the monks, implored the Son of God to save his tomb and his inheritance from impious violation.
 Their sole hope was in the mercy of the conqueror, and to their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> suppliant deputation that mercy was sternly denied.
 But a desperate and successful struggle of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> admonished the sultan that his triumph was not yet secure; he listened with reverence to a solemn adjuration in the name of the common Father of mankind; and a sentiment of human sympathy mollified the rigour of fanaticism and conquest.
 He consented to accept the city, and to spare the inhabitants.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Oriental</NORP> <NORP>Christians</NORP> were permitted to live under his dominion, but it was stipulated, that in forty days all the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> should evacuate Jerusalem, and be safely conducted to the seaports of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Egypt; that <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> pieces of gold should be paid for each man, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> for each woman, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> for every child; and that those who were unable to purchase their freedom should be detained in perpetual slavery.
 Of some writers it is a favourite and invidious theme to compare the humanity of <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> with the massacre of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade.
 The difference would be merely personal; but we should not forget that the <NORP>Christians</NORP> had offered to capitulate, and that the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> sustained the last extremities of an assault and storm.
 Justice is indeed due to the fidelity with which the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> conqueror fulfilled the conditions of the treaty; and he may be deservedly praised for the glance of pity which he cast on the misery of the vanquished.
 Instead of a rigorous exaction of his debt, he accepted a sum of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> byzants, for the ransom of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> poor; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> more were dismissed by his gratuitous clemency; and the number of slaves was reduced to eleven or fourteen <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> persons.
 In this interview with the queen, his words, and even his tears suggested the kindest consolations; his liberal alms were distributed among those who had been made orphans or widows by the fortune of war; and while the knights of the hospital were in arms against him, he allowed their more pious brethren to continue, during the term of a year, the care and service of the sick.
 In these acts of mercy the virtue of <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> deserves our admiration and love: he was above the necessity of dissimulation, and his stern fanaticism would have prompted him to dissemble, rather than to affect, this profane compassion for the enemies of the Koran.
 After <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> had been delivered from the presence of the strangers, the sultan made his triumphal entry, his banners waving in the wind, and to the harmony of martial music.
 The great mosque of Omar, which had been converted into a church, was again consecrated to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> God and his prophet Mahomet: the walls and pavement were purified with rose-water; and a pulpit, the labor of Noureddin, was erected in the sanctuary.
 But when the golden cross that glittered on the dome was cast down, and dragged through the streets, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of every sect uttered a lamentable groan, which was answered by the joyful shouts of the Moslems.
 In <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> ivory chests the patriarch had collected the crosses, the images, the vases, and the relics of the holy place; they were seized by the conqueror, who was desirous of presenting the caliph with the trophies of <NORP>Christian</NORP> idolatry.
 He was persuaded, however, to entrust them to the patriarch and prince of Antioch; and the pious pledge was redeemed by <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> of England, at the expense of fifty-two <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> byzants of gold.
 (64) The <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> crusade, by sea, A.
D.
 1188.
 The nations might fear and hope the immediate and final expulsion of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> from Syria; which was yet delayed above a century after the death of Saladin.
 (65) In the career of victory, he was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> checked by the resistance of Tyre; the troops and garrisons, which had capitulated, were imprudently conducted to the same port: their numbers were adequate to the defence of the place; and the arrival of <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> of <PERSON>Montferrat</PERSON> inspired the disorderly crowd with confidence and union.
 His father, a venerable pilgrim, had been made prisoner in the battle of Tiberias; but that disaster was unknown in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Greece, when the son was urged by ambition and piety to visit the inheritance of his royal nephew, the infant Baldwin.
 The view of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> banners warned him from the hostile coast of Jaffa; and <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> was unanimously hailed as the prince and champion of Tyre, which was already besieged by the conqueror of Jerusalem.
 The firmness of his zeal, and perhaps his knowledge of a generous foe, enabled him to brave the threats of the sultan, and to declare, that should his aged parent be exposed before the walls, he himself would discharge the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arrow, and glory in his descent from a <NORP>Christian</NORP> martyr.
 (66) The <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> fleet was allowed to enter the harbour of Tyre; but the chain was suddenly drawn, and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> galleys were either sunk or taken: a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Turks</NORP> were slain in a sally; and Saladin, after burning his engines, concluded a glorious campaign by a disgraceful retreat to Damascus.
 He was soon assailed by a more formidable tempest.
 The pathetic narratives, and even the pictures, that represented in lively colours the servitude and profanation of Jerusalem, awakened the torpid sensibility of Europe: the emperor <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, and the kings of <GPE>France</GPE> and England, assumed the cross; and the tardy magnitude of their armaments was anticipated by the maritime states of the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> and the Ocean.
 The skilful and provident <NORP>Italians</NORP> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> embarked in the ships of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice.
 They were speedily followed by the most eager pilgrims of France, Normandy, and the <NORP>Western</NORP> Isles.
 The powerful succour of Flanders, Frise, and Denmark, filled near a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> vessels: and the Northern warriors were distinguished in the field by a lofty stature and a ponderous battle- axe.
 (67) Their increasing multitudes could no longer be confined within the walls of Tyre, or remain obedient to the voice of Conrad.
 They pitied the misfortunes, and revered the dignity, of Lusignan, who was released from prison, perhaps, to divide the army of the Franks.
 He proposed the recovery of Ptolemais, or Acre, <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> miles to the south of Tyre; and the place was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot under his nominal command.
 I shall not expatiate on the story of this memorable siege; which lasted near <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years, and consumed, in a narrow space, the forces of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia.
 Siege of Acre, A.
D.
 1189, <DATE>July</DATE> - A.
D.
 1191, July.
 Never did the flame of enthusiasm burn with fiercer and more destructive rage; nor could the true believers, a common appellation, who consecrated their own martyrs, refuse some applause to the mistaken zeal and courage of their adversaries.
 At the sound of the holy trumpet, the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> of Egypt, Syria, Arabia, and the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> provinces, assembled under the servant of the prophet: (68) his camp was pitched and removed within a few miles of Acre; and he labored, night and day, for the relief of his brethren and the annoyance of the Franks.
 <CARDINAL>Nine</CARDINAL> battles, not unworthy of the name, were fought in the neighbourhood of Mount Carmel, with such vicissitude of fortune, that in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> attack, the sultan forced his way into the city; that in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> sally, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> penetrated to the royal tent.
 By the means of divers and pigeons, a regular correspondence was maintained with the besieged; and, as often as the sea was left open, the exhausted garrison was withdrawn, and a fresh supply was poured into the place.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> camp was thinned by famine, the sword and the climate; but the tents of the dead were replenished with new pilgrims, who exaggerated the strength and speed of their approaching countrymen.
 The vulgar was astonished by the report, that the pope himself, with an innumerable crusade, was advanced as far as Constantinople.
 The march of the emperor filled the <LOC>East</LOC> with more serious alarms: the obstacles which he encountered in Asia, and perhaps in Greece, were raised by the policy of Saladin: his joy on the death of <PERSON>Barbarossa</PERSON> was measured by his esteem; and the <NORP>Christians</NORP> were rather dismayed than encouraged at the sight of the duke of <PERSON>Swabia</PERSON> and his way-worn remnant of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Germans.
 At length, in the spring of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> year, the royal fleets of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>England</GPE> cast anchor in the Bay of Acre, and the siege was more vigorously prosecuted by the youthful emulation of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> kings, <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> Augustus and <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> Plantagenet.
 After every resource had been tried, and every hope was exhausted, the defenders of <LOC>Acre</LOC> submitted to their fate; a capitulation was granted, but their lives and liberties were taxed at the hard conditions of a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, the deliverance of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> nobles, and <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> inferior captives, and the restoration of the wood of the holy cross.
 Some doubts in the agreement, and some delay in the execution, rekindled the fury of the Franks, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Moslems, almost in the sultan's view, were beheaded by the command of the sanguinary Richard.
 (69) By the conquest of Acre, the <NORP>Latin</NORP> powers acquired a strong town and a convenient harbour; but the advantage was most dearly purchased.
 The minister and historian of <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> computes, from the report of the enemy, that their numbers, at different periods, amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand; that more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christians</NORP> were slain; that a far greater number was lost by disease or shipwreck; and that a small portion of this mighty host could return in safety to their native countries.

 <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> Augustus, and <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> the First, are the only kings of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>England</GPE> who have fought under the same banners; but the holy service in which they were enlisted was incessantly disturbed by their national jealousy; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions, which they protected in Palestine, were more averse to each other than to the common enemy.
 In the eyes of the Orientals; the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch was superior in dignity and power; and, in the emperor's absence, the <NORP>Latins</NORP> revered him as their temporal chief.
 (71) His exploits were not adequate to his fame.
 <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> was brave, but the statesman predominated in his character; he was soon weary of sacrificing his health and interest on a barren coast: the surrender of <LOC>Acre</LOC> became the signal of his departure; nor could he justify this unpopular desertion, by leaving the duke of <GPE>Burgundy</GPE> with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> knights and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot, for the service of the Holy Land.
 The king of England, though inferior in dignity, surpassed his rival in wealth and military renown; (72) and if heroism be confined to brutal and ferocious valour, <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> <PERSON>Plantagenet</PERSON> will stand high among the heroes of the age.
 The memory of Coeur de Lion, of the lion-hearted prince, was long dear and glorious to his <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> subjects; and, at the distance of sixty years, it was celebrated in proverbial sayings by the grandsons of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Saracens, against whom he had fought: his tremendous name was employed by the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> mothers to silence their infants; and if a horse suddenly started from the way, his rider was wont to exclaim, "Dost thou think King <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> is in that bush?" (73) His cruelty to the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> was the effect of temper and zeal; but I cannot believe that a soldier, so free and fearless in the use of his lance, would have descended to whet a dagger against his valiant brother <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> of Montferrat, who was slain at <GPE>Tyre</GPE> by some secret assassins.
 (74) After the surrender of Acre, and the departure of Philip, the king of <GPE>England</GPE> led the crusaders to the recovery of the sea-coast; and the cities of <GPE>Caesarea</GPE> and <GPE>Jaffa</GPE> were added to the fragments of the kingdom of Lusignan.
 A march of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles from <LOC>Acre</LOC> to <GPE>Ascalon</GPE> was a great and perpetual battle of eleven days.
 In the disorder of his troops, <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> remained on the field with <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> guards, without lowering his standard, or suspending the sound of his brazen kettle-drum: he again rallied and renewed the charge; and his preachers or heralds called aloud on the unitarians, manfully to stand up against the <NORP>Christian</NORP> idolaters.
 But the progress of these idolaters was irresistible; and it was only by demolishing the walls and buildings of Ascalon, that the sultan could prevent them from occupying an important fortress on the confines of Egypt.
 During a severe winter, the armies slept; but in the spring, the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> advanced within a day's march of Jerusalem, under the leading standard of the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> king; and his active spirit intercepted a convoy, or caravan, of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> camels.
 <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> (75) had fixed his station in the holy city; but the city was struck with consternation and discord: he fasted; he prayed; he preached; he offered to share the dangers of the siege; but his Mamalukes, who remembered the fate of their companions at Acre, pressed the sultan with loyal or seditious clamours, to reserve his person and their courage for the future defence of the religion and empire.
 (76) The <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were delivered by the sudden, or, as they deemed, the miraculous, retreat of the Christians; (77) and the laurels of <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> were blasted by the prudence, or envy, of his companions.
 The hero, ascending a hill, and veiling his face, exclaimed with an indignant voice,After his return to Acre, on the news that <GPE>Jaffa</GPE> was surprised by the sultan, he sailed with some merchant vessels, and leaped foremost on the beach: the castle was relieved by his presence; and sixty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Turks</NORP> and <NORP>Saracens</NORP> fled before his arms.
 The discovery of his weakness, provoked them to return in the morning; and they found him carelessly encamped before the gates with only <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> knights and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> archers.
 Without counting their numbers, he sustained their charge; and we learn from the evidence of his enemies, that the king of England, grasping his lance, rode furiously along their front, from the right to the left wing, without meeting an adversary who dared to encounter his career.
 (78) Am I writing the history of <GPE>Orlando</GPE> or Amadis? His treaty and departure, A.
D.
 1192, September.
 During these hostilities, a languid and tedious negotiation (79) between the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and <NORP>Moslems</NORP> was started, and continued, and broken, and again resumed, and again broken.
 Some acts of royal courtesy, the gift of snow and fruit, the exchange of <GPE>Norway</GPE> hawks and <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, softened the asperity of religious war: from the vicissitude of success, the monarchs might learn to suspect that <PERSON>Heaven</PERSON> was neutral in the quarrel; nor, after the trial of each other, could either hope for a decisive victory.
 (80) The health both of <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> and <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> appeared to be in a declining state; and they respectively suffered the evils of distant and domestic warfare: <PERSON>Plantagenet</PERSON> was impatient to punish a perfidious rival who had invaded <GPE>Normandy</GPE> in his absence; and the indefatigable sultan was subdued by the cries of the people, who was the victim, and of the soldiers, who were the instruments, of his martial zeal.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands of the king of <GPE>England</GPE> were the restitution of Jerusalem, Palestine, and the true cross; and he firmly declared, that himself and his brother pilgrims would end their lives in the pious labor, rather than return to <LOC>Europe</LOC> with ignominy and remorse.
 But the conscience of <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> refused, without some weighty compensation, to restore the idols, or promote the idolatry, of the Christians; he asserted, with equal firmness, his religious and civil claim to the sovereignty of Palestine; descanted on the importance and sanctity of Jerusalem; and rejected all terms of the establishment, or partition of the Latins.
 The marriage which <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> proposed, of his sister with the sultan's brother, was defeated by the difference of faith; the princess abhorred the embraces of a Turk; and Adel, or Saphadin, would not easily renounce a plurality of wives.
 A personal interview was declined by Saladin, who alleged their mutual ignorance of each other's language; and the negotiation was managed with much art and delay by their interpreters and envoys.
 The final agreement was equally disapproved by the zealots of both parties, by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff and the caliph of Bagdad.
 It was stipulated that <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> and the holy sepulchre should be open, without tribute or vexation, to the pilgrimage of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; that, after the demolition of Ascalon, they should inclusively possess the sea-coast from <GPE>Jaffa</GPE> to Tyre; that the count of <GPE>Tripoli</GPE> and the prince of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> should be comprised in the truce; and that, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months, all hostilities should cease.
 The principal chiefs of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies swore to the observance of the treaty; but the monarchs were satisfied with giving their word and their right hand; and the royal majesty was excused from an oath, which always implies some suspicion of falsehood and dishonour.
 <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> embarked for Europe, to seek a long captivity and a premature grave; and the space of a few <DATE>months</DATE> concluded the life and glories of Saladin.
 Death of Saladin, A.
D.
 1193, March 4.
 The <PERSON>Orientals</PERSON> describe his edifying death, which happened at Damascus; but they seem ignorant of the equal distribution of his alms among the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> religions, (81) or of the display of a shroud, instead of a standard, to admonish the <LOC>East</LOC> of the instability of human greatness.
 The unity of empire was dissolved by his death; his sons were oppressed by the stronger arm of their uncle Saphadin; the hostile interests of the sultans of Egypt, Damascus, and Aleppo, (82) were again revived; and the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> or <NORP>Latins</NORP> stood and breathed, and hoped, in their fortresses along the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> coast.
 <PERSON>Innocent</PERSON> III.
 A.
D.
 1198-1216.
 The noblest monument of a conqueror's fame, and of the terror which he inspired, is the Saladine tenth, a general tax which was imposed on the laity, and even the clergy, of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church, for the service of the holy war.
 The practice was too lucrative to expire with the occasion: and this tribute became the foundation of all the tithes and tenths on ecclesiastical benefices, which have been granted by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiffs to <NORP>Catholic</NORP> sovereigns, or reserved for the immediate use of the apostolic see.
 (83) This pecuniary emolument must have tended to increase the interest of the popes in the recovery of Palestine: after the death of Saladin, they preached the crusade, by their epistles, their legates, and their missionaries; and the accomplishment of the pious work might have been expected from the zeal and talents of <PERSON>Innocent</PERSON> the Third.
 (84) Under that young and ambitious priest, the successors of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> attained the full meridian of their greatness: and in a reign of eighteen years, he exercised a despotic command over the emperors and kings, whom he raised and deposed; over the nations, whom an interdict of <DATE>months</DATE> or <DATE>years</DATE> deprived, for the offence of their rulers, of the exercise of <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 In the council of the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> he acted as the ecclesiastical, almost as the temporal, sovereign of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West.
 It was at the feet of his legate that John of <GPE>England</GPE> surrendered his crown; and <PERSON>Innocent</PERSON> may boast of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most signal triumphs over sense and humanity, the establishment of transubstantiation, and the origin of the inquisition.
 At his voice, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> crusades, the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> and the fifth, were undertaken; but, except a king of Hungary, the princes of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> order were at the head of the pilgrims: the forces were inadequate to the design; nor did the effects correspond with the hopes and wishes of the pope and the people.
 The <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> crusade, A.
D.
 1203.
 The <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> crusade was diverted from <GPE>Syria</GPE> to Constantinople; and the conquest of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> or <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire by the <NORP>Latins</NORP> will form the proper and important subject of the next chapter.
 The fifth, A.
D.
 1218.
 In the fifth, (85) <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> were landed at the eastern mouth of the Nile.
 They reasonably hoped that <GPE>Palestine</GPE> must be subdued in Egypt, the seat and storehouse of the sultan; and, after a siege of sixteen months, the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> deplored the loss of Damietta.
 But the <NORP>Christian</NORP> army was ruined by the pride and insolence of the legate Pelagius, who, in the pope's name, assumed the character of general: the sickly <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> were encompassed by the waters of the <LOC>Nile</LOC> and the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> forces; and it was by the evacuation of <PERSON>Damietta</PERSON> that they obtained a safe retreat, some concessions for the pilgrims, and the tardy restitution of the doubtful relic of the true cross.
 The failure may in some measure be ascribed to the abuse and multiplication of the crusades, which were preached at the same time against the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> of Livonia, the <NORP>Moors</NORP> of Spain, the <PERSON>Albigeois</PERSON> of France, and the kings of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> family.
 (86) In these meritorious services, the volunteers might acquire at home the same spiritual indulgence, and a larger measure of temporal rewards; and even the popes, in their zeal against a domestic enemy, were sometimes tempted to forget the distress of their <NORP>Syrian</NORP> brethren.
 From the last age of the crusades they derived the occasional command of an army and revenue; and some deep reasoners have suspected that the whole enterprise, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> synod of Placentia, was contrived and executed by the policy of Rome.
 The suspicion is not founded, either in nature or in fact.
 The successors of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> appear to have followed, rather than guided, the impulse of manners and prejudice; without much foresight of the seasons, or cultivation of the soil, they gathered the ripe and spontaneous fruits of the superstition of the times.
 They gathered these fruits without toil or personal danger: in the council of the Lateran, <PERSON>Innocent</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> declared an ambiguous resolution of animating the crusaders by his example; but the pilot of the sacred vessel could not abandon the helm; nor was <GPE>Palestine</GPE> ever blessed with the presence of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 (87) The emperor Frederick II.
 in Palestine, A.
D.
 1228.
 The persons, the families, and estates of the pilgrims, were under the immediate protection of the popes; and these spiritual patrons soon claimed the prerogative of directing their operations, and enforcing, by commands and censures, the accomplishment of their vow.
 <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, (88) the grandson of Barbarossa, was successively the pupil, the enemy, and the victim of the church.
 At the age of twenty-one years, and in obedience to his guardian <PERSON>Innocent</PERSON> the Third, he assumed the cross; the same promise was repeated at his royal and imperial coronations; and his marriage with the heiress of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> forever bound him to defend the kingdom of his son Conrad.
 But as <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> advanced in age and authority, he repented of the rash engagements of his youth: his liberal sense and knowledge taught him to despise the phantoms of superstition and the crowns of Asia: he no longer entertained the same reverence for the successors of Innocent: and his ambition was occupied by the restoration of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> monarchy from <GPE>Sicily</GPE> to the Alps.
 But the success of this project would have reduced the popes to their primitive simplicity; and, after the delays and excuses of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years, they urged the emperor, with entreaties and threats, to fix the time and place of his departure for Palestine.
 In the harbours of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Apulia, he prepared a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> galleys, and of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> vessels, that were framed to transport and land <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> knights, with their horses and attendants; his vassals of <GPE>Naples</GPE> and <GPE>Germany</GPE> formed a powerful army; and the number of <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> crusaders was magnified to sixty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> by the report of fame.
 But the inevitable or affected slowness of these mighty preparations consumed the strength and provisions of the more indigent pilgrims: the multitude was thinned by sickness and desertion; and the sultry summer of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> anticipated the mischiefs of a <NORP>Syrian</NORP> campaign.
 At length the emperor hoisted sail at Brundusium, with a fleet and army of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men: but he kept the sea no more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days; and his hasty retreat, which was ascribed by his friends to a grievous indisposition, was accused by his enemies as a voluntary and obstinate disobedience.
 For suspending his vow was <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> excommunicated by Gregory the Ninth; for presuming, the next year, to accomplish his vow, he was again excommunicated by the same pope.
 (89) While he served under the banner of the cross, a crusade was preached against him in Italy; and after his return he was compelled to ask pardon for the injuries which he had suffered.
 The clergy and military orders of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> were previously instructed to renounce his communion and dispute his commands; and in his own kingdom, the emperor was forced to consent that the orders of the camp should be issued in the name of God and of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> republic.
 <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> entered <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> in triumph; and with his own hands (for no priest would perform the office) he took the crown from the altar of the holy sepulchre.
 But the patriarch cast an interdict on the church which his presence had profaned; and the knights of the hospital and temple informed the sultan how easily he might be surprised and slain in his unguarded visit to the River Jordan.
 In such a state of fanaticism and faction, victory was hopeless, and defence was difficult; but the conclusion of an advantageous peace may be imputed to the discord of the Mahometans, and their personal esteem for the character of Frederic.
 The enemy of the church is accused of maintaining with the miscreants an intercourse of hospitality and friendship unworthy of a Christian; of despising the barrenness of the land; and of indulging a profane thought, that if <PERSON>Jehovah</PERSON> had seen the kingdom of <GPE>Naples</GPE> he never would have selected <GPE>Palestine</GPE> for the inheritance of his chosen people.
 Yet <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> obtained from the sultan the restitution of Jerusalem, of <GPE>Bethlem</GPE> and Nazareth, of <GPE>Tyre</GPE> and Sidon; the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were allowed to inhabit and fortify the city; an equal code of civil and religious freedom was ratified for the sectaries of <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> and those of Mahomet; and, while the former worshipped at the holy sepulchre, the latter might pray and preach in the mosque of the temple, (90) from whence the prophet undertook his nocturnal journey to heaven.
 The clergy deplored this scandalous toleration; and the weaker <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were gradually expelled; but every rational object of the crusades was accomplished without bloodshed; the churches were restored, the monasteries were replenished; and, in the space of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years, the <NORP>Latins</NORP> of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> exceeded the number of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand.
 Invasion of the Carizmians, A.
D.
 1243.
 This peace and prosperity, for which they were ungrateful to their benefactor, was terminated by the irruption of the strange and savage hordes of Carizmians.
 (91) Flying from the arms of the Moguls, those shepherds of the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> rolled headlong on Syria; and the union of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> with the sultans of Aleppo, Hems, and Damascus, was insufficient to stem the violence of the torrent.
 Whatever stood against them was cut off by the sword, or dragged into captivity: the military orders were almost exterminated in a single battle; and in the pillage of the city, in the profanation of the holy sepulchre, the <NORP>Latins</NORP> confess and regret the modesty and discipline of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Saracens.
 St.
 Louis, and the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> crusade, A.
D.
 1248-1254.
 Of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> crusades, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> last were undertaken by <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the Ninth, king of France; who lost his liberty in Egypt, and his life on the coast of Africa.
 Twenty-eight <DATE>years</DATE> after his death, he was canonized at Rome; and <CARDINAL>sixty-five</CARDINAL> miracles were readily found, and solemnly attested, to justify the claim of the royal saint.
 (92) The voice of history renders a more honourable testimony, that he united the virtues of a king, a hero, and a man; that his martial spirit was tempered by the love of private and public justice; and that <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> was the father of his people, the friend of his neighbours, and the terror of the infidels.
 Superstition alone, in all the extent of her baleful influence, (93) corrupted his understanding and his heart: his devotion stooped to admire and imitate the begging friars of <PERSON>Francis</PERSON> and Dominic: he pursued with blind and cruel zeal the enemies of the faith; and the best of kings twice descended from his throne to seek the adventures of a spiritual knight-errant.
 A monkish historian would have been content to applaud the most despicable part of his character; but the noble and gallant Joinville, (94) who shared the friendship and captivity of Louis, has traced with the pencil of nature the free portrait of his virtues as well as of his failings.
 From this intimate knowledge we may learn to suspect the political views of depressing their great vassals, which are so often imputed to the royal authors of the crusades.
 Above all the princes of the middle ages, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Ninth</ORDINAL> successfully labored to restore the prerogatives of the crown; but it was at home and not in the East, that he acquired for himself and his posterity: his vow was the result of enthusiasm and sickness; and if he were the promoter, he was likewise the victim, of his holy madness.
 For the invasion of Egypt, <GPE>France</GPE> was exhausted of her troops and treasures; he covered the sea of <GPE>Cyprus</GPE> with eighteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> sails; the most modest numeration amounts to fifty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men; and, if we might trust his own confession, as it is reported by <NORP>Oriental</NORP> vanity, he disembarked nine <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horse, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot, who performed their pilgrimage under the shadow of his power.
 (95) He takes Damietta, A.
D.
 1249.
 In complete armour, the oriflamme waving before him, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> leaped foremost on the beach; and the strong city of Damietta, which had cost his predecessors a siege of sixteen months, was abandoned on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assault by the trembling Moslems.
 But <PERSON>Damietta</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and the last of his conquests; and in the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> crusades, the same causes, almost on the same ground, were productive of similar calamities.
 (96) After a ruinous delay, which introduced into the camp the seeds of an epidemic disease, the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> advanced from the sea-coast towards the capital of Egypt, and strove to surmount the unseasonable inundation of the Nile, which opposed their progress.
 Under the eye of their intrepid monarch, the barons and knights of <GPE>France</GPE> displayed their invincible contempt of danger and discipline: his brother, the count of Artois, stormed with inconsiderate valour the town of Massoura; and the carrier pigeons announced to the inhabitants of <GPE>Cairo</GPE> that all was lost.
 But a soldier, who afterwards usurped the sceptre, rallied the flying troops: the main body of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> was far behind the vanguard; and <PERSON>Artois</PERSON> was overpowered and slain.
 A shower of <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire was incessantly poured on the invaders; the <LOC>Nile</LOC> was commanded by the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> galleys, the open country by the Arabs; all provisions were intercepted; each <DATE>day</DATE> aggravated the sickness and famine; and about the same time a retreat was found to be necessary and impracticable.
 The <NORP>Oriental</NORP> writers confess, that <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> might have escaped, if he would have deserted his subjects; he was made prisoner, with the greatest part of his nobles; all who could not redeem their lives by service or ransom were inhumanly massacred; and the walls of <GPE>Cairo</GPE> were decorated with a circle of <NORP>Christian</NORP> heads.
 (97) His captivity in Egypt, A.
D.
 1250 April <CARDINAL>5</CARDINAL> - May 6.
 The king of <GPE>France</GPE> was loaded with chains; but the generous victor, a great-grandson of the brother of Saladin, sent a robe of honour to his royal captive, and his deliverance, with that of his soldiers, was obtained by the restitution of <PERSON>Damietta</PERSON> (98) and the payment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 In a soft and luxurious climate, the degenerate children of the companions of <PERSON>Noureddin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> were incapable of resisting the flower of <NORP>European</NORP> chivalry: they triumphed by the arms of their slaves or Mamalukes, the hardy natives of Tartary, who at a tender age had been purchased of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants, and were educated in the camp and palace of the sultan.
 But <GPE>Egypt</GPE> soon afforded a new example of the danger of praetorian bands; and the rage of these ferocious animals, who had been let loose on the strangers, was provoked to devour their benefactor.
 In the pride of conquest, Touran Shaw, the last of his race, was murdered by his Mamalukes; and the most daring of the assassins entered the chamber of the captive king, with drawn cimeters, and their hands imbrued in the blood of their sultan.
 The firmness of <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> commanded their respect; (99) their avarice prevailed over cruelty and zeal; the treaty was accomplished; and the king of France, with the relics of his army, was permitted to embark for Palestine.
 He wasted <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> within the walls of Acre, unable to visit Jerusalem, and unwilling to return without glory to his native country.
 The memory of his defeat excited Louis, after sixteen <DATE>years</DATE> of wisdom and repose, to undertake the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> and last of the crusades.
 His finances were restored, his kingdom was enlarged; a new generation of warriors had arisen, and he advanced with fresh confidence at the head of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot.
 The loss of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> had provoked the enterprise; a wild hope of baptizing the king of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> tempted him to steer for the <NORP>African</NORP> coast; and the report of an immense treasure reconciled his troops to the delay of their voyage to the Holy Land.
 Instead of a proselyte, he found a siege: the <NORP>French</NORP> panted and died on the burning sands: His death before Tunis, in the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> crusade, A.
D.
 1270, August 25.
 St.
 <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> expired in his tent; and no sooner had he closed his eyes, than his son and successor gave the signal of the retreat.
 (100) The <PRODUCT>Mamalukes</PRODUCT> of Egypt, A.
D.
 1250-1517.
 A more unjust and absurd constitution cannot be devised than that which condemns the natives of a country to perpetual servitude, under the arbitrary dominion of strangers and slaves.
 Yet such has been the state of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> above <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years.
 The most illustrious sultans of the <NORP>Baharite</NORP> and <PERSON>Borgite</PERSON> dynasties (102) were themselves promoted from the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> and <NORP>Circassian</NORP> bands; and the <CARDINAL>four-and-twenty</CARDINAL> beys, or military chiefs, have ever been succeeded, not by their sons, but by their servants.
 They produce the great charter of their liberties, the treaty of <PERSON>Selim</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> with the republic: (103) and the <NORP>Othman</NORP> emperor still accepts from <GPE>Egypt</GPE> a slight acknowledgment of tribute and subjection.
 With some breathing intervals of peace and order, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> dynasties are marked as a period of rapine and bloodshed: (104) but their throne, however shaken, reposed on the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> pillars of discipline and valour: their sway extended over Egypt, Nubia, Arabia, and Syria: their <PRODUCT>Mamalukes</PRODUCT> were multiplied from eight <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> to twenty-five <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse; and their numbers were increased by a provincial militia of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot, and the occasional aid of sixty-six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Arabs.
 (105) Princes of such power and spirit could not long endure on their coast a hostile and independent nation; and if the ruin of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> was postponed about forty years, they were indebted to the cares of an unsettled reign, to the invasion of the Moguls, and to the occasional aid of some warlike pilgrims.
 Among these, the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> reader will observe the name of our <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Edward, who assumed the cross in the lifetime of his father Henry.
 At the head of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers the future conqueror of <GPE>Wales</GPE> and <GPE>Scotland</GPE> delivered <LOC>Acre</LOC> from a siege; marched as far as <GPE>Nazareth</GPE> with an army of nine <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men; emulated the fame of his uncle Richard; extorted, by his valour, a <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years' truce; and escaped, with a dangerous wound, from the dagger of a fanatic assassin.
 (106) Loss of Antioch, A.
D.
 1286, June 12.
 Antioch, (107) whose situation had been less exposed to the calamities of the holy war, was finally occupied and ruined by Bondocdar, or Bibars, sultan of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Syria; the <NORP>Latin</NORP> principality was extinguished; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> seat of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> name was dispeopled by the slaughter of seventeen, and the captivity of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred, <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of her inhabitants.
 The maritime towns of Laodicea, Gabala, Tripoli, Berytus, Sidon, <GPE>Tyre</GPE> and Jaffa, and the stronger castles of the <NORP>Hospitallers</NORP> and Templars, successively fell; and the whole existence of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> was confined to the city and colony of St.
 John of Acre, which is sometimes described by the more classic title of Ptolemais.
 The loss of <LOC>Acre</LOC> and the Holy land, A.
D.
 1291, May 18.
 After the loss of Jerusalem, Acre, (108) which is distant about seventy miles, became the metropolis of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians, and was adorned with strong and stately buildings, with aqueducts, an artificial port, and a double wall.
 The population was increased by the incessant streams of pilgrims and fugitives: in the pauses of hostility the trade of the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> was attracted to this convenient station; and the market could offer the produce of every clime and the interpreters of every tongue.
 But in this conflux of nations, every vice was propagated and practised: of all the disciples of <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> and Mahomet, the male and female inhabitants of <LOC>Acre</LOC> were esteemed the most corrupt; nor could the abuse of religion be corrected by the discipline of law.
 The city had many sovereigns, and no government.
 The kings of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> and Cyprus, of the house of Lusignan, the princes of Antioch, the counts of <GPE>Tripoli</GPE> and Sidon, the great masters of the hospital, the temple, and the <NORP>Teutonic</NORP> order, the republics of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, the pope's legate, the kings of <GPE>France</GPE> and England, assumed an independent command: <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> tribunals exercised the power of life and death; every criminal was protected in the adjacent quarter; and the perpetual jealousy of the nations often burst forth in acts of violence and blood.
 Some adventurers, who disgraced the ensign of the cross, compensated their want of pay by the plunder of the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> villages: <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants, who traded under the public faith, were despoiled and hanged by the Christians; and the denial of satisfaction justified the arms of the sultan Khalil.
 He marched against Acre, at the head of sixty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot: his train of artillery (if I may use the word) was numerous and weighty: the separate timbers of a single engine were transported in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> wagons; and the royal historian Abulfeda, who served with the troops of Hamah, was himself a spectator of the holy war.
 Whatever might be the vices of the Franks, their courage was rekindled by enthusiasm and despair; but they were torn by the discord of <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> chiefs, and overwhelmed on all sides by the powers of the sultan.
 After a siege of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days, the double wall was forced by the Moslems; the principal tower yielded to their engines; the <PRODUCT>Mamalukes</PRODUCT> made a general assault; the city was stormed; and death or slavery was the lot of sixty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Christians.
 The convent, or rather fortress, of the <ORG>Templars</ORG> resisted <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days longer; but the great master was pierced with an arrow; and, of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> knights, only <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> were left alive, less happy than the victims of the sword, if they lived to suffer on a scaffold, in the unjust and cruel proscription of the whole order.
 The king of Jerusalem, the patriarch and the great master of the hospital, effected their retreat to the shore; but the sea was rough, the vessels were insufficient; and great numbers of the fugitives were drowned before they could reach the Isle of Cyprus, which might comfort <PERSON>Lusignan</PERSON> for the loss of Palestine.
 By the command of the sultan, the churches and fortifications of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> cities were demolished: a motive of avarice or fear still opened the holy sepulchre to some devout and defenceless pilgrims; and a mournful and solitary silence prevailed along the coast which had so long resounded with the WORLD'S DEBATE.
