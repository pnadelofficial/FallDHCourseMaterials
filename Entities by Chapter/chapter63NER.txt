 Their Wars with the Empire and City of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> Superstition of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> and the times, A.
D.
 1282-1320 The long reign of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> (1) the elder is chiefly memorable by the disputes of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church, the invasion of the Catalans, and the rise of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> power.
 He is celebrated as the most learned and virtuous prince of the age; but such virtue, and such learning, contributed neither to the perfection of the individual, nor to the happiness of society A slave of the most abject superstition, he was surrounded on all sides by visible and invisible enemies; nor were the flames of hell less dreadful to his fancy, than those of a <NORP>Catalan</NORP> or <NORP>Turkish</NORP> war.
 Under the reign of the Palaeologi, the choice of the patriarch was the most important business of the state; the heads of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church were ambitious and fanatic monks; and their vices or virtues, their learning or ignorance, were equally mischievous or contemptible.
 By his intemperate discipline, the patriarch <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> (2) excited the hatred of the clergy and people: he was heard to declare, that the sinner should swallow the last dregs of the cup of penance; and the foolish tale was propagated of his punishing a sacrilegious ass that had tasted the lettuce of a convent garden.
 Driven from the throne by the universal clamour, <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> composed before his retreat <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> papers of a very opposite cast.
 His public testament was in the tone of charity and resignation; the private codicil breathed the direst anathemas against the authors of his disgrace, whom he excluded forever from the communion of the holy trinity, the angels, and the saints.
 This last paper he enclosed in an earthen pot, which was placed, by his order, on the top of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the pillars, in the dome of St.
 Sophia, in the distant hope of discovery and revenge.
 At the end of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, some youths, climbing by a ladder in search of pigeons' nests, detected the fatal secret; and, as <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> felt himself touched and bound by the excommunication, he trembled on the brink of the abyss which had been so treacherously dug under his feet.
 A synod of bishops was instantly convened to debate this important question: the rashness of these clandestine anathemas was generally condemned; but as the knot could be untied only by the same hand, as that hand was now deprived of the crosier, it appeared that this posthumous decree was irrevocable by any earthly power.
 Some faint testimonies of repentance and pardon were extorted from the author of the mischief; but the conscience of the emperor was still wounded, and he desired, with no less ardour than <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> himself, the restoration of a patriarch, by whom alone he could be healed.
 At the dead of night, a monk rudely knocked at the door of the royal bed-chamber, announcing a revelation of plague and famine, of inundations and earthquakes.
 <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> started from his bed, and spent the <TIME>night</TIME> in prayer, till he felt, or thought that he felt, a slight motion of the earth.
 The emperor on foot led the bishops and monks to the cell of Athanasius; and, after a proper resistance, the saint, from whom this message had been sent, consented to absolve the prince, and govern the church of Constantinople.
 Untamed by disgrace, and hardened by solitude, the shepherd was again odious to the flock, and his enemies contrived a singular, and as it proved, a successful, mode of revenge.
 In the night, they stole away the footstool or foot-cloth of his throne, which they secretly replaced with the decoration of a satirical picture.
 The emperor was painted with a bridle in his mouth, and <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> leading the tractable beast to the feet of Christ.
 The authors of the libel were detected and punished; but as their lives had been spared, the <NORP>Christian</NORP> priest in sullen indignation retired to his cell; and the eyes of Andronicus, which had been opened for a moment, were again closed by his successor.
 If this transaction be <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most curious and important of a reign of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years, I cannot at least accuse the brevity of my materials, since I reduce into some few pages the enormous folios of Pachymer, (3) Cantacuzene, (4) and Nicephorus Gregoras, (5) who have composed the prolix and languid story of the times.
 The name and situation of the emperor John <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> might inspire the most lively curiosity.
 His memorials of forty years extend from the revolt of the younger <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> to his own abdication of the empire; and it is observed, that, like <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and Caesar, he was the principal actor in the scenes which he describes.
 But in this eloquent work we should vainly seek the sincerity of a hero or a penitent.
 Retired in a cloister from the vices and passions of the world, he presents not a confession, but an apology, of the life of an ambitious statesman.
 Instead of unfolding the true counsels and characters of men, he displays the smooth and specious surface of events, highly varnished with his own praises and those of his friends.
 Their motives are always pure; their ends always legitimate: they conspire and rebel without any views of interest; and the violence which they inflict or suffer is celebrated as the spontaneous effect of reason and virtue.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> disputes between the elder and the younger Andronicus, A.
D.
 1320.
 After the example of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the Palaeologi, the elder <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> associated his son <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> to the honours of the purple; and from the age of eighteen to his premature death, that prince was acknowledged, above twenty- five years, as the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> emperor of the Greeks.
 (6) At the head of an army, he excited neither the fears of the enemy, nor the jealousy of the court; his modesty and patience were never tempted to compute the years of his father; nor was that father compelled to repent of his liberality either by the virtues or vices of his son.
 The son of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was named <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> from his grandfather, to whose early favour he was introduced by that nominal resemblance.
 The blossoms of wit and beauty increased the fondness of the elder Andronicus; and, with the common vanity of age, he expected to realize in the second, the hope which had been disappointed in the first, generation.
 The boy was educated in the palace as an heir and a favourite; and in the oaths and acclamations of the people, the august triad was formed by the names of the father, the son, and the grandson.
 But the younger <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> was speedily corrupted by his infant greatness, while he beheld with puerile impatience the double obstacle that hung, and might long hang, over his rising ambition.
 It was not to acquire fame, or to diffuse happiness, that he so eagerly aspired: wealth and impunity were in his eyes the most precious attributes of a monarch; and his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> indiscreet demand was the sovereignty of some rich and fertile island, where he might lead a life of independence and pleasure.
 The emperor was offended by the loud and frequent intemperance which disturbed his capital; the sums which his parsimony denied were supplied by the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> usurers of Pera; and the oppressive debt, which consolidated the interest of a faction, could be discharged only by a revolution.
 A beautiful female, a matron in rank, a prostitute in manners, had instructed the younger <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> in the rudiments of love; but he had reason to suspect the nocturnal visits of a rival; and a stranger passing through the street was pierced by the arrows of his guards, who were placed in ambush at her door.
 That stranger was his brother, Prince Manuel, who languished and died of his wound; and the emperor Michael, their common father, whose health was in a declining state, expired on the eighth day, lamenting the loss of both his children.
 (7) However guiltless in his intention, the younger <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might impute a brother's and a father's death to the consequence of his own vices; and deep was the sigh of thinking and feeling men, when they perceived, instead of sorrow and repentance, his ill-dissembled joy on the removal of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> odious competitors.
 By these melancholy events, and the increase of his disorders, the mind of the elder emperor was gradually alienated; and, after many fruitless reproofs, he transferred on another grandson (8) his hopes and affection.
 The change was announced by the new oath of allegiance to the reigning sovereign, and the person whom he should appoint for his successor; and the acknowledged heir, after a repetition of insults and complaints, was exposed to the indignity of a public trial.
 Before the sentence, which would probably have condemned him to a dungeon or a cell, the emperor was informed that the palace courts were filled with the armed followers of his grandson; the judgment was softened to a treaty of reconciliation; and the triumphant escape of the prince encouraged the ardour of the younger faction.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> civil wars between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, A.
D.
 1321, April 20-A.
D.
 1328, May 24.
.
 Yet the capital, the clergy, and the senate, adhered to the person, or at least to the government, of the old emperor; and it was only in the provinces, by flight, and revolt, and foreign succour, that the malcontents could hope to vindicate their cause and subvert his throne.
 The soul of the enterprise was the great domestic John Cantacuzene; the sally from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> is the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> date of his actions and memorials; and if his own pen be most descriptive of his patriotism, an unfriendly historian has not refused to celebrate the zeal and ability which he displayed in the service of the young emperor.
 That prince escaped from the capital under the pretence of hunting; erected his standard at Adrianople; and, in a few days, assembled <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse and foot, whom neither honour nor duty could have armed against the Barbarians.
 Such a force might have saved or commanded the empire; but their counsels were discordant, their motions were slow and doubtful, and their progress was checked by intrigue and negotiation.
 The quarrel of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <GPE>Andronici</GPE> was protracted, and suspended, and renewed, during a ruinous period of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> treaty, the relics of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire were divided: Constantinople, Thessalonica, and the islands, were left to the elder, while the younger acquired the sovereignty of the greatest part of Thrace, from <GPE>Philippi</GPE> to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> limit.
 Coronation of the younger Andronicus, A.
D.
 1325, February 2.
 By the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> treaty, he stipulated the payment of his troops, his immediate coronation, and an adequate share of the power and revenue of the state.
 The <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> civil war was terminated by the surprise of Constantinople, the final retreat of the old emperor, and the sole reign of his victorious grandson.
 The reasons of this delay may be found in the characters of the men and of the times.
 When the heir of the monarchy <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> pleaded his wrongs and his apprehensions, he was heard with pity and applause: and his adherents repeated on all sides the inconsistent promise, that he would increase the pay of the soldiers and alleviate the burdens of the people.
 The grievances of forty years were mingled in his revolt; and the rising generation was fatigued by the endless prospect of a reign, whose favourites and maxims were of other times.
 The youth of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> had been without spirit, his age was without reverence: his taxes produced an unusual revenue of five hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds; yet the richest of the sovereigns of <ORG>Christendom</ORG> was incapable of maintaining <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> galleys, to resist the destructive progress of the Turks.
 (9) But the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were soon admonished, that the public disorders could not be healed by a civil war; and that their young favourite was not destined to be the saviour of a falling empire.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> repulse, his party was broken by his own levity, their intestine discord, and the intrigues of the ancient court, which tempted each malcontent to desert or betray the cause of the rebellion.
 <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> the younger was touched with remorse, or fatigued with business, or deceived by negotiation: pleasure rather than power was his aim; and the license of maintaining a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> hounds, a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> hawks, and a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> huntsmen, was sufficient to sully his fame and disarm his ambition.
 The elder <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> abdicates the government, A.
D.
 1328, May 24.
 Let us now survey the catastrophe of this busy plot, and the final situation of the principal actors.
 (10) The age of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> was consumed in civil discord; and, amidst the events of war and treaty, his power and reputation continually decayed, till the fatal <TIME>night</TIME> in which the gates of the city and palace were opened without resistance to his grandson.
 His principal commander scorned the repeated warnings of danger; and retiring to rest in the vain security of ignorance, abandoned the feeble monarch, with some priests and pages, to the terrors of a sleepless night.
 These terrors were quickly realized by the hostile shouts, which proclaimed the titles and victory of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> the younger; and the aged emperor, falling prostrate before an image of the Virgin, despatched a suppliant message to resign the sceptre, and to obtain his life at the hands of the conqueror.
 The answer of his grandson was decent and pious; at the prayer of his friends, the younger <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> assumed the sole administration; but the elder still enjoyed the name and preeminence of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emperor, the use of the great palace, and a pension of twenty-four <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> of which was assigned on the royal treasury, and the other on the fishery of Constantinople.
 But his impotence was soon exposed to contempt and oblivion; the vast silence of the palace was disturbed only by the cattle and poultry of the neighbourhood, which roved with impunity through the solitary courts; and a reduced allowance of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold (11) was all that he could ask, and more than he could hope.
 His calamities were embittered by the gradual extinction of sight; his confinement was rendered each day more rigorous; and during the absence and sickness of his grandson, his inhuman keepers, by the threats of instant death, compelled him to exchange the purple for the monastic habit and profession.
 The monk <PERSON>Antony</PERSON> had renounced the pomp of the world; yet he had occasion for a coarse fur in the winter season, and as wine was forbidden by his confessor, and water by his physician, the sherbet of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> was his common drink.
 It was not without difficulty that the late emperor could procure <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> pieces to satisfy these simple wants; and if he bestowed the gold to relieve the more painful distress of a friend, the sacrifice is of some weight in the scale of humanity and religion.
 His death, A.
D.
 1332, February 13.
 Four years after his abdication, <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> or <PERSON>Antony</PERSON> expired in a cell, in the seventy-fourth year of his age: and the last strain of adulation could only promise a more splendid crown of glory in heaven than he had enjoyed upon earth.
 (12) Reign of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> the younger, A.
D.
 1328, May <CARDINAL>24</CARDINAL> - A.
D.
 1341, June 15.
 Nor was the reign of the younger, more glorious or fortunate than that of the elder, Andronicus.
 (13) He gathered the fruits of ambition; but the taste was transient and bitter: in the supreme station he lost the remains of his early popularity; and the defects of his character became still more conspicuous to the world.
 The public reproach urged him to march in person against the Turks; nor did his courage fail in the hour of trial; but a defeat and a wound were the only trophies of his expedition in Asia, which confirmed the establishment of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> monarchy.
 The abuses of the civil government attained their full maturity and perfection: his neglect of forms, and the confusion of national dresses, are deplored by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as the fatal symptoms of the decay of the empire.
 <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> was old before his time; the intemperance of youth had accelerated the infirmities of age; and after being rescued from a dangerous malady by nature, or physic, or the Virgin, he was snatched away before he had accomplished his forty-fifth year.
 His <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> wives.
 He was twice married; and, as the progress of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> in arms and arts had softened the prejudices of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court, his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> wives were chosen in the princely houses of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy.
 The first, <PERSON>Agnes</PERSON> at home, <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> in Greece, was daughter of the duke of Brunswick.
 Her father (14) was a petty lord (15) in the poor and savage regions of the north of Germany: (16) yet he derived some revenue from his silver mines; (17) and his family is celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as the most ancient and noble of the <NORP>Teutonic</NORP> name.
 (18) After the death of this childish princess, <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> sought in marriage Jane, the sister of the count of Savoy; (19) and his suit was preferred to that of the <NORP>French</NORP> king.
 (20) The count respected in his sister the superior majesty of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress: her retinue was composed of knights and ladies; she was regenerated and crowned in St.
 Sophia, under the more orthodox appellation of Anne; and, at the nuptial feast, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Italians</NORP> vied with each other in the martial exercises of tilts and tournaments.
 Reign of John Palaeologus, A.
D.
 1341, June 15- A.
D.
 1391.
 The empress <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> of <PERSON>Savoy</PERSON> survived her husband: heir son, John Palaeologus, was left an orphan and an emperor in the ninth year of his age; and his weakness was protected by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most deserving of the Greeks.
 Fortune of John Cantacuzene.
 The long and cordial friendship of his father for John <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> is alike honourable to the prince and the subject.
 It had been formed amidst the pleasures of their youth: their families were almost equally noble; (21) and the recent lustre of the purple was amply compensated by the energy of a private education.
 We have seen that the young emperor was saved by <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> from the power of his grandfather; and, after six years of civil war, the same favourite brought him back in triumph to the palace of Constantinople.
 Under the reign of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> the younger, the great domestic ruled the emperor and the empire; and it was by his valour and conduct that the Isle of Lesbos and the principality of <GPE>Aetolia</GPE> were restored to their ancient allegiance.
 His enemies confess, that, among the public robbers, <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> alone was moderate and abstemious; and the free and voluntary account which he produces of his own wealth (22) may sustain the presumption that he was devolved by inheritance, and not accumulated by rapine.
 He does not indeed specify the value of his money, plate, and jewels; yet, after a voluntary gift of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred vases of silver, after much had been secreted by his friends and plundered by his foes, his forfeit treasures were sufficient for the equipment of a fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys.
 He does not measure the size and number of his estates; but his granaries were heaped with an incredible store of wheat and barley; and the labor of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> yoke of oxen might cultivate, according to the practice of antiquity, about sixty-two <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> five hundred acres of arable land.
 (23) His pastures were stocked with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> five hundred brood mares, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred camels, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred mules, five hundred asses, five <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horned cattle, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> hogs, and <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> sheep: (24) a precious record of rural opulence, in the last period of the empire, and in a land, most probably in Thrace, so repeatedly wasted by foreign and domestic hostility.
 The favour of <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> was above his fortune.
 He is left regent of the empire.
 In the moments of familiarity, in the hour of sickness, the emperor was desirous to level the distance between them and pressed his friend to accept the diadem and purple.
 The virtue of the great domestic, which is attested by his own pen, resisted the dangerous proposal; but the last testament of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> the younger named him the guardian of his son, and the regent of the empire.
 His regency is attacked, A.
D.
 1341, Had the regent found a suitable return of obedience and gratitude, perhaps he would have acted with pure and zealous fidelity in the service of his pupil.
 (25) A guard of five hundred soldiers watched over his person and the palace; the funeral of the late emperor was decently performed; the capital was silent and submissive; and five hundred letters, which <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> despatched in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> month, informed the provinces of their loss and their duty.
 The prospect of a tranquil minority was blasted by the great duke or admiral Apocaucus, and to exaggerate his perfidy, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> historian is pleased to magnify his own imprudence, in raising him to that office against the advice of his more sagacious sovereign.
 by Apocaucus; Bold and subtle, rapacious and profuse, the avarice and ambition of <PERSON>Apocaucus</PERSON> were by turns subservient to each other; and his talents were applied to the ruin of his country.
 His arrogance was heightened by the command of a naval force and an impregnable castle, and under the mask of oaths and flattery he secretly conspired against his benefactor.
 by the empress <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> of Savoy; The female court of the empress was bribed and directed; he encouraged <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> of <PERSON>Savoy</PERSON> to assert, by the law of nature, the tutelage of her son; the love of power was disguised by the anxiety of maternal tenderness: and the founder of the <NORP>Palaeologi</NORP> had instructed his posterity to dread the example of a perfidious guardian.
 by the patriarch.
 The patriarch John of Apri was a proud and feeble old man, encompassed by a numerous and hungry kindred.
 He produced an obsolete epistle of Andronicus, which bequeathed the prince and people to his pious care: the fate of his predecessor <PERSON>Arsenius</PERSON> prompted him to prevent, rather than punish, the crimes of a usurper; and <PERSON>Apocaucus</PERSON> smiled at the success of his own flattery, when he beheld the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> priest assuming the state and temporal claims of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 (26) Between <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> persons so different in their situation and character, a private league was concluded: a shadow of authority was restored to the senate; and the people was tempted by the name of freedom.
 By this powerful confederacy, the great domestic was assaulted at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> with clandestine, at length with open, arms.
 His prerogatives were disputed; his opinions slighted; his friends persecuted; and his safety was threatened both in the camp and city.
 In his absence on the public service, he was accused of treason; proscribed as an enemy of the church and state; and delivered with all his adherents to the sword of justice, the vengeance of the people, and the power of the devil; his fortunes were confiscated; his aged mother was cast into prison; all his past services were buried in oblivion; and he was driven by injustice to perpetrate the crime of which he was accused.
 (27) From the review of his preceding conduct, <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> appears to have been guiltless of any treasonable designs; and the only suspicion of his innocence must arise from the vehemence of his protestations, and the sublime purity which he ascribes to his own virtue.
 While the empress and the patriarch still affected the appearances of harmony, he repeatedly solicited the permission of retiring to a private, and even a monastic, life.
 After he had been declared a public enemy, it was his fervent wish to throw himself at the feet of the young emperor, and to receive without a murmur the stroke of the executioner: it was not without reluctance that he listened to the voice of reason, which inculcated the sacred duty of saving his family and friends, and proved that he could only save them by drawing the sword and assuming the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> title.
 <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> assumes the Purple, A.
D.
 1341, October 26.
 In the strong city of Demotica, his peculiar domain, the emperor John Cantacuzenus was invested with the purple buskins: his right leg was clothed by his noble kinsmen, the left by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> chiefs, on whom he conferred the order of knighthood.
 But even in this act of revolt, he was still studious of loyalty; and the titles of John <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> of <PERSON>Savoy</PERSON> were proclaimed before his own name and that of his wife Irene.
 Such vain ceremony is a thin disguise of rebellion, nor are there perhaps any personal wrongs that can authorize a subject to take arms against his sovereign: but the want of preparation and success may confirm the assurance of the usurper, that this decisive step was the effect of necessity rather than of choice.
 <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> adhered to the young emperor; the king of <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> was invited to the relief of Adrianople: the principal cities of <GPE>Thrace</GPE> and Macedonia, after some hesitation, renounced their obedience to the great domestic; and the leaders of the troops and provinces were induced, by their private interest, to prefer the loose dominion of a woman and a priest.
 The army of Cantacuzene, in <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> divisions, was stationed on the banks of the <LOC>Melas</LOC> to tempt or to intimidate the capital: it was dispersed by treachery or fear; and the officers, more especially the mercenary Latins, accepted the bribes, and embraced the service, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 After this loss, the rebel emperor (he fluctuated between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> characters) took the road of <GPE>Thessalonica</GPE> with a chosen remnant; but he failed in his enterprise on that important place; and he was closely pursued by the great duke, his enemy Apocaucus, at the head of a superior power by sea and land.
 Driven from the coast, in his march, or rather flight, into the mountains of Servia, <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> assembled his troops to scrutinize those who were worthy and willing to accompany his broken fortunes.
 A base majority bowed and retired; and his trusty band was diminished to <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand, and at last to five hundred, volunteers.
 The cral, (28) or despot of the <NORP>Servians</NORP> received him with general hospitality; but the ally was insensibly degraded to a suppliant, a hostage, a captive; and in this miserable dependence, he waited at the door of the Barbarian, who could dispose of the life and liberty of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 The civil war, A.
D.
 1341-1347.
 The most tempting offers could not persuade the cral to violate his trust; but he soon inclined to the stronger side; and his friend was dismissed without injury to a new vicissitude of hopes and perils.
 Near six years the flame of discord burnt with various success and unabated rage: the cities were distracted by the faction of the nobles and the plebeians; the <NORP>Cantacuzeni</NORP> and Palaeologi: and the Bulgarians, the Servians, and the Turks, were invoked on both sides as the instruments of private ambition and the common ruin.
 The regent deplored the calamities, of which he was the author and victim: and his own experience might dictate a just and lively remark on the different nature of foreign and civil war.
 Victory of Cantacuzene.
 The introduction of barbarians and savages into the contests of civilized nations, is a measure pregnant with shame and mischief; which the interest of the moment may compel, but which is reprobated by the best principles of humanity and reason.
 It is the practice of both sides to accuse their enemies of the guilt of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> alliances; and those who fail in their negotiations are loudest in their censure of the example which they envy and would gladly imitate.
 The <NORP>Turks</NORP> of <LOC>Asia</LOC> were less barbarous perhaps than the shepherds of <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> and Servia; but their religion rendered them implacable foes of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Christianity.
 To acquire the friendship of their emirs, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions vied with each other in baseness and profusion: the dexterity of <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> obtained the preference: but the succour and victory were dearly purchased by the marriage of his daughter with an infidel, the captivity of many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Christians, and the passage of the <NORP>Ottomans</NORP> into Europe, the last and fatal stroke in the fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The inclining scale was decided in his favour by the death of Apocaucus, the just though singular retribution of his crimes.
 A crowd of nobles or plebeians, whom he feared or hated, had been seized by his orders in the capital and the provinces; and the old palace of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was assigned as the place of their confinement.
 Some alterations in raising the walls, and narrowing the cells, had been ingeniously contrived to prevent their escape, and aggravate their misery; and the work was incessantly pressed by the daily visits of the tyrant.
 His guards watched at the gate, and as he stood in the inner court to overlook the architects, without fear or suspicion, he was assaulted and laid breathless on the ground, by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> resolute prisoners of the <NORP>Palaeologian</NORP> race, (30) who were armed with sticks, and animated by despair.
 On the rumour of revenge and liberty, the captive multitude broke their fetters, fortified their prison, and exposed from the battlements the tyrant's head, presuming on the favour of the people and the clemency of the empress.
 <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> of <PERSON>Savoy</PERSON> might rejoice in the fall of a haughty and ambitious minister, but while she delayed to resolve or to act, the populace, more especially the mariners, were excited by the widow of the great duke to a sedition, an assault, and a massacre.
 The prisoners (of whom the far greater part were guiltless or inglorious of the deed) escaped to a neighbouring church: they were slaughtered at the foot of the altar; and in his death the monster was not less bloody and venomous than in his life.
 Yet his talents alone upheld the cause of the young emperor; and his surviving associates, suspicious of each other, abandoned the conduct of the war, and rejected the fairest terms of accommodation.
 In the beginning of the dispute, the empress felt, and complained, that she was deceived by the enemies of Cantacuzene: the patriarch was employed to preach against the forgiveness of injuries; and her promise of immortal hatred was sealed by an oath, under the penalty of excommunication.
 (31) But <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> soon learned to hate without a teacher: she beheld the misfortunes of the empire with the indifference of a stranger: her jealousy was exasperated by the competition of a rival empress; and on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> symptoms of a more yielding temper, she threatened the patriarch to convene a synod, and degrade him from his office.
 Their incapacity and discord would have afforded the most decisive advantage; but the civil war was protracted by the weakness of both parties; and the moderation of <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> has not escaped the reproach of timidity and indolence.
 He successively recovered the provinces and cities; and the realm of his pupil was measured by the walls of Constantinople; but the metropolis alone counterbalanced the rest of the empire; nor could he attempt that important conquest till he had secured in his favour the public voice and a private correspondence.
 He re-enters Constantinople, A.
D.
 1347, <DATE>January</DATE> 8.
 An Italian, of the name of Facciolati, (32) had succeeded to the office of great duke: the ships, the guards, and the golden gate, were subject to his command; but his humble ambition was bribed to become the instrument of treachery; and the revolution was accomplished without danger or bloodshed.
 Destitute of the powers of resistance, or the hope of relief, the inflexible <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> would have still defended the palace, and have smiled to behold the capital in flames, rather than in the possession of a rival.
 She yielded to the prayers of her friends and enemies; and the treaty was dictated by the conqueror, who professed a loyal and zealous attachment to the son of his benefactor.
 The marriage of his daughter with John <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> was at length consummated: the hereditary right of the pupil was acknowledged; but the sole administration during <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years was vested in the guardian.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> emperors and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> empresses were seated on the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne; and a general amnesty quieted the apprehensions, and confirmed the property, of the most guilty subjects.
 The festival of the coronation and nuptials was celebrated with the appearances of concord and magnificence, and both were equally fallacious.
 During the late troubles, the treasures of the state, and even the furniture of the palace, had been alienated or embezzled; the royal banquet was served in pewter or earthenware; and such was the proud poverty of the times, that the absence of gold and jewels was supplied by the paltry artifices of glass and gilt-leather.
 (33) Reign of John Cantacuzene, A.
D.
 1347, <DATE>January</DATE> <CARDINAL>8</CARDINAL> -1355, January.
 I hasten to conclude the personal history of John Cantacuzene.
 (34) He triumphed and reigned; but his reign and triumph were clouded by the discontent of his own and the adverse faction.
 His followers might style the general amnesty an act of pardon for his enemies, and of oblivion for his friends: (35) in his cause their estates had been forfeited or plundered; and as they wandered naked and hungry through the streets, they cursed the selfish generosity of a leader, who, on the throne of the empire, might relinquish without merit his private inheritance.
 The adherents of the empress blushed to hold their lives and fortunes by the precarious favour of a usurper; and the thirst of revenge was concealed by a tender concern for the succession, and even the safety, of her son.
 They were justly alarmed by a petition of the friends of Cantacuzene, that they might be released from their oath of allegiance to the Palaeologi, and entrusted with the defence of some cautionary towns; a measure supported with argument and eloquence; and which was rejected (says the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> historian) "by my sublime, and almost incredible virtue.
" His repose was disturbed by the sound of plots and seditions; and he trembled lest the lawful prince should be stolen away by some foreign or domestic enemy, who would inscribe his name and his wrongs in the banners of rebellion.
 As the son of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> advanced in the years of manhood, he began to feel and to act for himself; and his rising ambition was rather stimulated than checked by the imitation of his father's vices.
 If we may trust his own professions, <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> labored with honest industry to correct these sordid and sensual appetites, and to raise the mind of the young prince to a level with his fortune.
 In the <NORP>Servian</NORP> expedition, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors showed themselves in cordial harmony to the troops and provinces; and the younger colleague was initiated by the elder in the mysteries of war and government.
 After the conclusion of the peace, <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> was left at Thessalonica, a royal residence, and a frontier station, to secure by his absence the peace of Constantinople, and to withdraw his youth from the temptations of a luxurious capital.
 But the distance weakened the powers of control, and the son of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> was surrounded with artful or unthinking companions, who taught him to hate his guardian, to deplore his exile, and to vindicate his rights.
 A private treaty with the cral or despot of <PERSON>Servia</PERSON> was soon followed by an open revolt; and Cantacuzene, on the throne of the elder Andronicus, defended the cause of age and prerogative, which in his youth he had so vigorously attacked.
 At his request the empress-mother undertook the voyage of Thessalonica, and the office of mediation: she returned without success; and unless <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> of <PERSON>Savoy</PERSON> was instructed by adversity, we may doubt the sincerity, or at least the fervour, of her zeal.
 While the regent grasped the sceptre with a firm and vigorous hand, she had been instructed to declare, that the <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years of his legal administration would soon elapse; and that, after a full trial of the vanity of the world, the emperor <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> sighed for the repose of a cloister, and was ambitious only of a heavenly crown.
 Had these sentiments been genuine, his voluntary abdication would have restored the peace of the empire, and his conscience would have been relieved by an act of justice.
 <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> alone was responsible for his future government; and whatever might be his vices, they were surely less formidable than the calamities of a civil war, in which the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> and infidels were again invited to assist the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> in their mutual destruction.
 John <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> takes up arms against him, A.
D.
 1353.
 By the arms of the Turks, who now struck a deep and everlasting root in Europe, <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> prevailed in the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> contest in which he had been involved; and the young emperor, driven from the sea and land, was compelled to take shelter among the <NORP>Latins</NORP> of the Isle of Tenedos.
 His insolence and obstinacy provoked the victor to a step which must render the quarrel irreconcilable; and the association of his son Matthew, whom he invested with the purple, established the succession in the family of the Cantacuzeni.
 But <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was still attached to the blood of her ancient princes; and this last injury accelerated the restoration of the rightful heir.
 A noble <NORP>Genoese</NORP> espoused the cause of Palaeologus, obtained a promise of his sister, and achieved the revolution with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> galleys and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> five hundred auxiliaries.
 Under the pretence of distress, they were admitted into the lesser port; a gate was opened, and the <NORP>Latin</NORP> shout of, "Long life and victory to the emperor, John Palaeologus!" was answered by a general rising in his favour.
 A numerous and loyal party yet adhered to the standard of Cantacuzene: but he asserts in his history (does he hope for belief?) that his tender conscience rejected the assurance of conquest; that, in free obedience to the voice of religion and philosophy, he descended from the throne and embraced with pleasure the monastic habit and profession.
 (36) So soon as he ceased to be a prince, his successor was not unwilling that he should be a saint: the remainder of his life was devoted to piety and learning; <ORG>Abdication</ORG> of Cantacuzene,A.
D.
 1335,January.
 in the cells of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Mount Athos, the monk <PERSON>Joasaph</PERSON> was respected as the temporal and spiritual father of the emperor; and if he issued from his retreat, it was as the minister of peace, to subdue the obstinacy, and solicit the pardon, of his rebellious son.
 (37) Dispute concerning the light of mount Thabor, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>1341</CARDINAL> - 1351.
 Yet in the cloister, the mind of <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> was still exercised by theological war.
 He sharpened a controversial pen against the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and Mahometans; (38) and in every state he defended with equal zeal the divine light of Mount Thabor, a memorable question which consummates the religious follies of the Greeks.
 The fakirs of India, (39) and the monks of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> church, were alike persuaded, that in the total abstraction of the faculties of the mind and body, the purer spirit may ascend to the enjoyment and vision of the Deity.
 The opinion and practice of the monasteries of Mount Athos (40) will be best represented in the words of an abbot, who flourished in the eleventh century.
 This light, the production of a distempered fancy, the creature of an empty stomach and an empty brain, was adored by the <NORP>Quietists</NORP> as the pure and perfect essence of God himself; and as long as the folly was confined to Mount Athos, the simple solitaries were not inquisitive how the divine essence could be a material substance, or how an immaterial substance could be perceived by the eyes of the body.
 But in the reign of the younger Andronicus, these monasteries were visited by Barlaam, (41) a <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> monk, who was equally skilled in philosophy and theology; who possessed the language of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins; and whose versatile genius could maintain their opposite creeds, according to the interest of the moment.
 The indiscretion of an ascetic revealed to the curious traveller the secrets of mental prayer and <PERSON>Barlaam</PERSON> embraced the opportunity of ridiculing the Quietists, who placed the soul in the navel; of accusing the monks of Mount Athos of heresy and blasphemy.
 His attack compelled the more learned to renounce or dissemble the simple devotion of their brethren; and Gregory Palamas introduced a scholastic distinction between the essence and operation of God.
 His inaccessible essence dwells in the midst of an uncreated and eternal light; and this beatific vision of the saints had been manifested to the disciples on Mount Thabor, in the transfiguration of Christ.
 Yet this distinction could not escape the reproach of polytheism; the eternity of the light of <PERSON>Thabor</PERSON> was fiercely denied; and <PERSON>Barlaam</PERSON> still charged the <NORP>Palamites</NORP> with holding <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God.
 From the rage of the monks of Mount Athos, who threatened his life, the <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> retired to Constantinople, where his smooth and specious manners introduced him to the favour of the great domestic and the emperor.
 The court and the city were involved in this theological dispute, which flamed amidst the civil war; but the doctrine of <PERSON>Barlaam</PERSON> was disgraced by his flight and apostasy: the <NORP>Palamites</NORP> triumphed; and their adversary, the patriarch John of Apri, was deposed by the consent of the adverse factions of the state.
 In the character of emperor and theologian, <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> presided in the synod of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church, which established, as an article of faith, the uncreated light of Mount Thabor; and, after so many insults, the reason of mankind was slightly wounded by the addition of a single absurdity.
 Many rolls of paper or parchment have been blotted; and the impenitent sectaries, who refused to subscribe the orthodox creed, were deprived of the honours of <NORP>Christian</NORP> burial; but in the next age the question was forgotten; nor can I learn that the axe or the faggot were employed for the extirpation of the <NORP>Barlaamite</NORP> heresy.
 (42) Establishment of the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> at <GPE>Pera</GPE> or Galata, A.
D.
 1261 - 1347.
 For the conclusion of this chapter, I have reserved the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> war, which shook the throne of Cantacuzene, and betrayed the debility of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire.
 The Genoese, who, after the recovery of Constantinople, were seated in the suburb of <GPE>Pera</GPE> or Galata, received that honourable fief from the bounty of the emperor.
 They were indulged in the use of their laws and magistrates; but they submitted to the duties of vassals and subjects; the forcible word of liegemen (43) was borrowed from the <NORP>Latin</NORP> jurisprudence; and their podesta, or chief, before he entered on his office, saluted the emperor with loyal acclamations and vows of fidelity.
 <GPE>Genoa</GPE> sealed a firm alliance with the Greeks; and, in case of a defensive war, a supply of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> empty galleys and a succour of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, completely armed and manned, was promised by the republic to the empire.
 In the revival of a naval force, it was the aim of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> to deliver himself from a foreign aid; and his vigorous government contained the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> of <GPE>Galata</GPE> within those limits which the insolence of wealth and freedom provoked them to exceed.
 A sailor threatened that they should soon be masters of Constantinople, and slew the <NORP>Greek</NORP> who resented this national affront; and an armed vessel, after refusing to salute the palace, was guilty of some acts of piracy in the Black Sea.
 Their countrymen threatened to support their cause; but the long and open village of <GPE>Galata</GPE> was instantly surrounded by the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops; till, in the moment of the assault, the prostrate <NORP>Genoese</NORP> implored the clemency of their sovereign.
 The defenceless situation which secured their obedience exposed them to the attack of their <NORP>Venetian</NORP> rivals, who, in the reign of the elder Andronicus, presumed to violate the majesty of the throne.
 On the approach of their fleets, the Genoese, with their families and effects, retired into the city: their empty habitations were reduced to ashes; and the feeble prince, who had viewed the destruction of his suburb, expressed his resentment, not by arms, but by ambassadors.
 This misfortune, however, was advantageous to the Genoese, who obtained, and imperceptibly abused, the dangerous license of surrounding <GPE>Galata</GPE> with a strong wall; of introducing into the ditch the waters of the sea; of erecting lofty turrets; and of mounting a train of military engines on the rampart.
 The narrow bounds in which they had been circumscribed were insufficient for the growing colony; each day they acquired some addition of landed property; and the adjacent hills were covered with their villas and castles, which they joined and protected by new fortifications.
 (44) The navigation and trade of the <NORP>Euxine</NORP> was the patrimony of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors, who commanded the narrow entrance, the gates, as it were, of that inland sea.
 In the reign of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> Palaeologus, their prerogative was acknowledged by the sultan of Egypt, who solicited and obtained the liberty of sending an annual ship for the purchase of slaves in <GPE>Circassia</GPE> and the Lesser Tartary: Their trade and insolence.
 a liberty pregnant with mischief to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> cause; since these youths were transformed by education and discipline into the formidable Mamalukes.
 (45) From the colony of Pera, the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> engaged with superior advantage in the lucrative trade of the Black Sea; and their industry supplied the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> with fish and corn; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> articles of food almost equally important to a superstitious people.
 The spontaneous bounty of nature appears to have bestowed the harvests of Ukraine, the produce of a rude and savage husbandry; and the endless exportation of salt fish and caviare is annually renewed by the enormous sturgeons that are caught at the mouth of the <FAC>Don</FAC> or Tanais, in their last station of the rich mud and shallow water of the Maeotis.
 (46) The waters of the Oxus, the Caspian, the Volga, and the Don, opened a rare and laborious passage for the gems and spices of India; and after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months' march the caravans of <ORG>Carizme</ORG> met the <NORP>Italian</NORP> vessels in the harbours of Crimaea.
 (47) These various branches of trade were monopolized by the diligence and power of the Genoese.
 Their rivals of <GPE>Venice</GPE> and <GPE>Pisa</GPE> were forcibly expelled; the natives were awed by the castles and cities, which arose on the foundations of their humble factories; and their principal establishment of <ORG>Caffa</ORG> (48) was besieged without effect by the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> powers.
 Destitute of a navy, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by these haughty merchants, who fed, or famished, Constantinople, according to their interest.
 They proceeded to usurp the customs, the fishery, and even the toll, of the Bosphorus; and while they derived from these objects a revenue of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, a remnant of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> was reluctantly allowed to the emperor.
 (49) The colony of <GPE>Pera</GPE> or <GPE>Galata</GPE> acted, in peace and war, as an independent state; and, as it will happen in distant settlements, the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> podesta too often forgot that he was the servant of his own masters.
 Their war with the emperor Cantacuzene, A.
D.
 1348.
 These usurpations were encouraged by the weakness of the elder Andronicus, and by the civil wars that afflicted his age and the minority of his grandson.
 The talents of <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> were employed to the ruin, rather than the restoration, of the empire; and after his domestic victory, he was condemned to an ignominious trial, whether the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> or the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> should reign in Constantinople.
 The merchants of <GPE>Pera</GPE> were offended by his refusal of some contiguous land, some commanding heights, which they proposed to cover with new fortifications; and in the absence of the emperor, who was detained at <PERSON>Demotica</PERSON> by sickness, they ventured to brave the debility of a female reign.
 A <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> vessel, which had presumed to fish at the mouth of the harbour, was sunk by these audacious strangers; the fishermen were murdered.
 Instead of suing for pardon, the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> demanded satisfaction; required, in a haughty strain, that the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> should renounce the exercise of navigation; and encountered with regular arms the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> sallies of the popular indignation.
 They instantly occupied the debatable land; and by the labor of a whole people, of either sex and of every age, the wall was raised, and the ditch was sunk, with incredible speed.
 At the same time, they attacked and burnt <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> galleys; while the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> others, the remainder of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> navy, escaped from their hands: the habitations without the gates, or along the shore, were pillaged and destroyed; and the care of the regent, of the empress Irene, was confined to the preservation of the city.
 The return of <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> dispelled the public consternation: the emperor inclined to peaceful counsels; but he yielded to the obstinacy of his enemies, who rejected all reasonable terms, and to the ardour of his subjects, who threatened, in the style of Scripture, to break them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
 Yet they reluctantly paid the taxes, that he imposed for the construction of ships, and the expenses of the war; and as the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations were masters, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the land, the other of the sea, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and <GPE>Pera</GPE> were pressed by the evils of a mutual siege.
 The merchants of the colony, who had believed that a few days would terminate the war, already murmured at their losses: the succours from their mother-country were delayed by the factions of Genoa; and the most cautious embraced the opportunity of a <NORP>Rhodian</NORP> vessel to remove their families and effects from the scene of hostility.
 Destruction of his fleet, A.
D.
 1349.
 In the spring, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> fleet, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys and a train of smaller vessels, issued from the mouth of the harbour, and steered in a single line along the shore of Pera; unskilfully presenting their sides to the beaks of the adverse squadron.
 The crews were composed of peasants and mechanics; nor was their ignorance compensated by the native courage of Barbarians: the wind was strong, the waves were rough; and no sooner did the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> perceive a distant and inactive enemy, than they leaped headlong into the sea, from a doubtful, to an inevitable peril.
 The troops that marched to the attack of the lines of <GPE>Pera</GPE> were struck at the same moment with a similar panic; and the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> were astonished, and almost ashamed, at their double victory.
 Their triumphant vessels, crowned with flowers, and dragging after them the captive galleys, repeatedly passed and repassed before the palace: the only virtue of the emperor was patience; and the hope of revenge his sole consolation.
 Yet the distress of both parties interposed a temporary agreement; and the shame of the empire was disguised by a thin veil of dignity and power.
 Summoning the chiefs of the colony, <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> affected to despise the trivial object of the debate; and, after a mild reproof, most liberally granted the lands, which had been previously resigned to the seeming custody of his officers.
 (50) Victory of the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> over the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> and Greeks, A.
D.
 1352, February 13.
 But the emperor was soon solicited to violate the treaty, and to join his arms with the Venetians, the perpetual enemies of <GPE>Genoa</GPE> and her colonies.
 While he compared the reasons of peace and war, his moderation was provoked by a wanton insult of the inhabitants of Pera, who discharged from their rampart a large stone that fell in the midst of Constantinople.
 On his just complaint, they coldly blamed the imprudence of their engineer; but the next day the insult was repeated; and they exulted in a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> proof that the royal city was not beyond the reach of their artillery.
 <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> instantly signed his treaty with the Venetians; but the weight of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was scarcely felt in the balance of these opulent and powerful republics.
 (51) From the Straits of Gibraltar to the mouth of the Tanais, their fleets encountered each other with various success; and a memorable battle was fought in the narrow sea, under the walls of Constantinople.
 It would not be an easy task to reconcile the accounts of the Greeks, the Venetians, and the Genoese; (52) and while I depend on the narrative of an impartial historian, (53) I shall borrow from each nation the facts that redound to their own disgrace, and the honour of their foes.
 The Venetians, with their allies the Catalans, had the advantage of number; and their fleet, with the poor addition of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> galleys, amounted to <CARDINAL>seventy-five</CARDINAL> sail: the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> did not exceed sixty-four; but in those times their ships of war were distinguished by the superiority of their size and strength.
 The names and families of their naval commanders, <PERSON>Pisani</PERSON> and Doria, are illustrious in the annals of their country; but the personal merit of the former was eclipsed by the fame and abilities of his rival.
 They engaged in tempestuous weather; and the tumultuary conflict was continued from the dawn to the extinction of light.
 The enemies of the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> applaud their prowess; the friends of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> are dissatisfied with their behaviour; but all parties agree in praising the skill and boldness of the Catalans, who, with many wounds, sustained the brunt of the action.
 On the separation of the fleets, the event might appear doubtful; but the <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> <NORP>Genoese</NORP> galleys, that had been sunk or taken, were compensated by a double loss of the allies; of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> Venetians, <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> Catalans, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Greeks; and even the grief of the conquerors expressed the assurance and habit of more decisive victories.
 <PERSON>Pisani</PERSON> confessed his defeat, by retiring into a fortified harbour, from whence, under the pretext of the orders of the senate, he steered with a broken and flying squadron for the Isle of Candia, and abandoned to his rivals the sovereignty of the sea.
 In a public epistle, (54) addressed to the doge and senate, <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> employs his eloquence to reconcile the maritime powers, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> luminaries of Italy.
 The orator celebrates the valour and victory of the Genoese, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of men in the exercise of naval war: he drops a tear on the misfortunes of their <NORP>Venetian</NORP> brethren; but he exhorts them to pursue with fire and sword the base and perfidious Greeks; to purge the metropolis of the <LOC>East</LOC> from the heresy with which it was infected.
 Their treaty with the empire, May 6.
 Deserted by their friends, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were incapable of resistance; and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months after the battle, the emperor <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> solicited and subscribed a treaty, which forever banished the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> and Catalans, and granted to the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> a monopoly of trade, and almost a right of dominion.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire (I smile in transcribing the name) might soon have sunk into a province of Genoa, if the ambition of the republic had not been checked by the ruin of her freedom and naval power.
 A long contest of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and thirty years was determined by the triumph of Venice; and the factions of the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> compelled them to seek for domestic peace under the protection of a foreign lord, the duke of Milan, or the <NORP>French</NORP> king.
 Yet the spirit of commerce survived that of conquest; and the colony of <GPE>Pera</GPE> still awed the capital and navigated the Euxine, till it was involved by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in the final servitude of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> itself.
