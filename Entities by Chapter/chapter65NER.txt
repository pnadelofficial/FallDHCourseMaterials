 Histories of TIMOUR, or <NORP>Tamerlane</NORP> The conquest and monarchy of the world was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> object of the ambition of TIMOUR.
 To live in the memory and esteem of future ages was the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wish of his magnanimous spirit.
 All the civil and military transactions of his reign were diligently recorded in the journals of his secretaries: (1) the authentic narrative was revised by the persons best informed of each particular transaction; and it is believed in the empire and family of Timour, that the monarch himself composed the commentaries (2) of his life, and the institutions (3) of his government.
 (4) But these cares were ineffectual for the preservation of his fame, and these precious memorials in the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> or <NORP>Persian</NORP> language were concealed from the world, or, at least, from the knowledge of Europe.
 The nations which he vanquished exercised a base and impotent revenge; and ignorance has long repeated the tale of calumny, (5) which had disfigured the birth and character, the person, and even the name, of Tamerlane.
 (6) Yet his real merit would be enhanced, rather than debased, by the elevation of a peasant to the throne of Asia; nor can his lameness be a theme of reproach, unless he had the weakness to blush at a natural, or perhaps an honourable, infirmity.
 In the eyes of the Moguls, who held the indefeasible succession of the house of Zingis, he was doubtless a rebel subject; yet he sprang from the noble tribe of Berlass: his <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> ancestor, Carashar Nevian, had been the vizier of Zagatai, in his new realm of Transoxiana; and in the ascent of some generations, the branch of <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> is confounded, at least by the females, (7) with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> stem.
 (8) He was born <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> miles to the south of <GPE>Samarcand</GPE> in the village of Sebzar, in the fruitful territory of Cash, of which his fathers were the hereditary chiefs, as well as of a toman of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand horse.
 (9) His birth (10) was cast on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of those periods of anarchy, which announce the fall of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> dynasties, and open a new field to adventurous ambition.
 The khans of <PERSON>Zagatai</PERSON> were extinct; the emirs aspired to independence; and their domestic feuds could only be suspended by the conquest and tyranny of the khans of Kashgar, who, with an army of <PERSON>Getes</PERSON> or Calmucks, (11) invaded the <NORP>Transoxian</NORP> kingdom.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> adventures, A.
D.
 1361-1370.
 From the twelfth year of his age, <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> had entered the field of action; in the twenty-fifth he stood forth as the deliverer of his country; and the eyes and wishes of the people were turned towards a hero who suffered in their cause.
 The chiefs of the law and of the army had pledged their salvation to support him with their lives and fortunes; but in the hour of danger they were silent and afraid; and, after waiting <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days on the hills of Samarcand, he retreated to the desert with only sixty horsemen.
 The fugitives were overtaken by a thousand Getes, whom he repulsed with incredible slaughter, and his enemies were forced to exclaim, "Timour is a wonderful man: fortune and the divine favour are with him.
" But in this bloody action his own followers were reduced to ten, a number which was soon diminished by the desertion of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> Carizmians.
 He wandered in the desert with his wife, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> companions, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> horses; and sixty-two days was he plunged in a loathsome dungeon, from whence he escaped by his own courage and the remorse of the oppressor.
 After swimming the broad and rapid steam of the Jihoon, or Oxus, he led, during some months, the life of a vagrant and outlaw, on the borders of the adjacent states.
 But his fame shone brighter in adversity; he learned to distinguish the friends of his person, the associates of his fortune, and to apply the various characters of men for their advantage, and, above all, for his own.
 On his return to his native country, <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> was successively joined by the parties of his confederates, who anxiously sought him in the desert; nor can I refuse to describe, in his pathetic simplicity, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their fortunate encounters.
 He presented himself as a guide to <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> chiefs, who were at the head of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> horse.
 His trusty bands were soon increased by the bravest of the tribes; he led them against a superior foe; and, after some vicissitudes of war the <PERSON>Getes</PERSON> were finally driven from the kingdom of Transoxiana.
 He had done much for his own glory; but much remained to be done, much art to be exerted, and some blood to be spilt, before he could teach his equals to obey him as their master.
 The birth and power of emir <PERSON>Houssein</PERSON> compelled him to accept a vicious and unworthy colleague, whose sister was the best beloved of his wives.
 Their union was short and jealous; but the policy of Timour, in their frequent quarrels, exposed his rival to the reproach of injustice and perfidy; and, after a final defeat, <PERSON>Houssein</PERSON> was slain by some sagacious friends, who presumed, for the last time, to disobey the commands of their lord.
 He ascends the throne of Zagatai, A.
D.
 1370, <DATE>April</DATE> At the age of thirty-four, (12) and in a general diet or couroultai, he was invested with <NORP>Imperial</NORP> command, but he affected to revere the house of Zingis; and while the emir <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> reigned over <PERSON>Zagatai</PERSON> and the East, a nominal khan served as a private officer in the armies of his servant.
 A fertile kingdom, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles in length and in breadth, might have satisfied the ambition of a subject; but <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> aspired to the dominion of the world; and before his death, the crown of <PERSON>Zagatai</PERSON> was <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the twenty- <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> crowns which he had placed on his head.
 Without expatiating on the victories of <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> campaigns; without describing the lines of march, which he repeatedly traced over the continent of Asia; I shall briefly represent his conquests in, I.
 Persia, II.
 Tartary, and, III.
 India, (13) and from thence proceed to the more interesting narrative of his <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> war.
 His conquests, A.
D.
 1370-1400 I.
 of Persia, A.
D.
 1380-1393.
 For every war, a motive of safety or revenge, of honour or zeal, of right or convenience, may be readily found in the jurisprudence of conquerors.
 No sooner had <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> reunited to the patrimony of <PERSON>Zagatai</PERSON> the dependent countries of <GPE>Carizme</GPE> and Candahar, than he turned his eyes towards the kingdoms of <GPE>Iran</GPE> or Persia.
 From the <LOC>Oxus</LOC> to the Tigris, that extensive country was left without a lawful sovereign since the death of Abousaid, the last of the descendants of the great Holacou.
 Peace and justice had been banished from the land above <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> years; and the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> invader might seem to listen to the cries of an oppressed people.
 Their petty tyrants might have opposed him with confederate arms: they separately stood, and successively fell; and the difference of their fate was only marked by the promptitude of submission or the obstinacy of resistance.
 Ibrahim, prince of Shirwan, or Albania, kissed the footstool of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> throne.
 His peace-offerings of silks, horses, and jewels, were composed, according to the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> fashion, each article of <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> pieces; but a critical spectator observed, that there were only <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> slaves.
 "I myself am the ninth," replied Ibrahim, who was prepared for the remark; and his flattery was rewarded by the smile of Timour.
 (14) Shah Mansour, prince of Fars, or the proper Persia, was <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the least powerful, but most dangerous, of his enemies.
 In a battle under the walls of Shiraz, he broke, with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand soldiers, the coul or main body of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand horse, where the emperor fought in person.
 No more than fourteen or <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> guards remained near the standard of Timour: he stood firm as a rock, and received on his helmet <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> weighty strokes of a cimeter: (15) the <ORG>Moguls</ORG> rallied; the head of <PERSON>Mansour</PERSON> was thrown at his feet; and he declared his esteem of the valour of a foe, by extirpating all the males of so intrepid a race.
 From Shiraz, his troops advanced to the <NORP>Persian</NORP> Gulf; and the richness and weakness of <PERSON>Ormuz</PERSON> (16) were displayed in an <DATE>annual</DATE> tribute of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred thousand dinars of gold.
 <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> was no longer the city of peace, the seat of the caliphs; but the noblest conquest of <GPE>Holacou</GPE> could not be overlooked by his ambitious successor.
 The whole course of the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> and Euphrates, from the mouth to the sources of those rivers, was reduced to his obedience: he entered Edessa; and the <NORP>Turkmans</NORP> of the black sheep were chastised for the sacrilegious pillage of a caravan of Mecca.
 In the mountains of Georgia, the native <NORP>Christians</NORP> still braved the law and the sword of Mahomet, by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> expeditions he obtained the merit of the gazie, or holy war; and the prince of <PERSON>Teflis</PERSON> became his proselyte and friend.
 II of Turkestan, A.
D.
 <DATE>1370-1383</DATE> A just retaliation might be urged for the invasion of Turkestan, or the Eastern Tartary.
 The dignity of <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> could not endure the impunity of the Getes: he passed the Sihoon, subdued the kingdom of Kashgar, and marched <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> times into the heart of their country.
 His most distant camp was <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months' journey, or <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred and eighty leagues to the north-east of Samarcand; and his emirs, who traversed the River Irtish, engraved in the forests of <LOC>Siberia</LOC> a rude memorial of their exploits.
 The conquest of Kipzak, or the Western Tartary, (17) was founded on the double motive of aiding the distressed, and chastising the ungrateful.
 Toctamish, a fugitive prince, was entertained and protected in his court: the ambassadors of Auruss Khan were dismissed with a haughty denial, and followed on the same day by the armies of Zagatai; and their success established <PERSON>Toctamish</PERSON> in the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> empire of the North.
 But, after a reign of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years, the new khan forgot the merits and the strength of his benefactor; the base usurper, as he deemed him, of the sacred rights of the house of Zingis.
 Through the gates of Derbend, he entered <GPE>Persia</GPE> at the head of ninety thousand horse: with the innumerable forces of Kipzak, Bulgaria, Circassia, and Russia, he passed the Sihoon, burnt the palaces of Timour, and compelled him, amidst the winter snows, to contend for <GPE>Samarcand</GPE> and his life.
 After a mild expostulation, and a glorious victory, the emperor resolved on revenge; of Kipzak, Russia, etc, A.
D.
 <DATE>1390-1396</DATE> and by the east, and the west, of the Caspian, and the Volga, he twice invaded <GPE>Kipzak</GPE> with such mighty powers, that thirteen miles were measured from his right to his left wing.
 In a march of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months, they rarely beheld the footsteps of man; and their daily subsistence was often trusted to the fortune of the chase.
 At length the armies encountered each other; but the treachery of the standard-bearer, who, in the heat of action, reversed the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> standard of Kipzak, determined the victory of the Zagatais; and <PERSON>Toctamish</PERSON> (I speak the language of the Institutions) gave the tribe of <PERSON>Toushi</PERSON> to the wind of desolation.
 (18) He fled to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> duke of Lithuania; again returned to the banks of the Volga; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> battles with a domestic rival, at last perished in the wilds of Siberia.
 The pursuit of a flying enemy carried <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> into the tributary provinces of Russia: a duke of the reigning family was made prisoner amidst the ruins of his capital; and Yeletz, by the pride and ignorance of the Orientals, might easily be confounded with the genuine metropolis of the nation.
 <GPE>Moscow</GPE> trembled at the approach of the Tartar, and the resistance would have been feeble, since the hopes of the <NORP>Russians</NORP> were placed in a miraculous image of the Virgin, to whose protection they ascribed the casual and voluntary retreat of the conqueror.
 Ambition and prudence recalled him to the South, the desolate country was exhausted, and the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> soldiers were enriched with an immense spoil of precious furs, of linen of Antioch, (19) and of ingots of gold and silver.
 (20) On the banks of the Don, or Tanais, he received an humble deputation from the consuls and merchants of Egypt, (21) Venice, Genoa, Catalonia, and Biscay, who occupied the commerce and city of Tana, or Azoph, at the mouth of the river.
 They offered their gifts, admired his magnificence, and trusted his royal word.
 But the peaceful visit of an emir, who explored the state of the magazines and harbour, was speedily followed by the destructive presence of the Tartars.
 The city was reduced to ashes; the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were pillaged and dismissed; but all the Christians, who had not fled to their ships, were condemned either to death or slavery.
 (22) Revenge prompted him to burn the cities of <GPE>Serai</GPE> and Astrachan, the monuments of rising civilization; and his vanity proclaimed, that he had penetrated to the region of perpetual daylight, a strange phenomenon, which authorized his <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> doctors to dispense with the obligation of <TIME>evening</TIME> prayer.
 (23) III of Hindostan, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>1398-1399</CARDINAL> When <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> proposed to his princes and emirs the invasion of <GPE>India</GPE> or Hindostan, (24) he was answered by a murmur of discontent: But the displeasure of the emperor was more dreadful than all these terrors; and his superior reason was convinced, that an enterprise of such tremendous aspect was safe and easy in the execution.
 He was informed by his spies of the weakness and anarchy of Hindostan: the soubahs of the provinces had erected the standard of rebellion; and the perpetual infancy of Sultan <PERSON>Mahmoud</PERSON> was despised even in the harem of Delhi.
 The <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> army moved in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> great divisions; and <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> observes with pleasure, that the <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> squadrons of a thousand horse most fortunately corresponded with the <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> names or epithets of the prophet Mahomet.
 Between the <LOC>Jihoon</LOC> and the <LOC>Indus</LOC> they crossed <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ridges of mountains, which are styled by the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> geographers The Stony Girdles of the Earth.
 The highland robbers were subdued or extirpated; but great numbers of men and horses perished in the snow; the emperor himself was let down a precipice on a portable scaffold — the ropes were <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and fifty cubits in length; and before he could reach the bottom, this dangerous operation was <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times repeated.
 <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> crossed the <LOC>Indus</LOC> at the ordinary passage of Attok; and successively traversed, in the footsteps of Alexander, the Punjab, or <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> rivers, (25) that fall into the master stream.
 From <GPE>Attok</GPE> to Delhi, the high road measures no more than <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred miles; but the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conquerors deviated to the south-east; and the motive of <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> was to join his grandson, who had achieved by his command the conquest of Moultan.
 On the eastern bank of the Hyphasis, on the edge of the desert, the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> hero halted and wept: the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> entered the desert, reduced the fortress of Batmir, and stood in arms before the gates of Delhi, a great and flourishing city, which had subsisted <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> centuries under the dominion of the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> kings.
 The siege, more especially of the castle, might have been a work of time; but he tempted, by the appearance of weakness, the sultan <PERSON>Mahmoud</PERSON> and his vizier to descend into the plain, with <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand cuirassiers, <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> thousand of his foot-guards, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and twenty elephants, whose tusks are said to have been armed with sharp and poisoned daggers.
 Against these monsters, or rather against the imagination of his troops, he condescended to use some extraordinary precautions of fire and a ditch, of iron spikes and a rampart of bucklers; but the event taught the <ORG>Moguls</ORG> to smile at their own fears; and as soon as these unwieldy animals were routed, the inferior species (the men of India) disappeared from the field.
 <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> made his triumphal entry into the capital of Hindostan; and admired, with a view to imitate, the architecture of the stately mosque; but the order or license of a general pillage and massacre polluted the festival of his victory.
 He resolved to purify his soldiers in the blood of the idolaters, or Gentoos, who still surpass, in the proportion of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> to one, the numbers of the Moslems.
 In this pious design, he advanced <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles to the north-east of Delhi, passed the Ganges, fought several battles by land and water, and penetrated to the famous rock of Coupele, the statue of the cow, that seems to discharge the mighty river, whose source is far distant among the mountains of Thibet.
 (26) His return was along the skirts of the northern hills; nor could this rapid campaign of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> year justify the strange foresight of his emirs, that their children in a warm climate would degenerate into a race of Hindoos.
 His war against sultan Bajazet, A.
D.
 1400, September 1.
 It was on the banks of the <LOC>Ganges</LOC> that <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> was informed, by his speedy messengers, of the disturbances which had arisen on the confines of <GPE>Georgia</GPE> and Anatolia, of the revolt of the Christians, and the ambitious designs of the sultan Bajazet.
 His vigour of mind and body was not impaired by sixty-three years, and innumerable fatigues; and, after enjoying some tranquil months in the palace of Samarcand, he proclaimed a new expedition of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years into the western countries of Asia.
 (27) To the soldiers who had served in the <NORP>Indian</NORP> war he granted the choice of remaining at home, or following their prince; but the troops of all the provinces and kingdoms of <GPE>Persia</GPE> were commanded to assemble at Ispahan, and wait the arrival of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> standard.
 It was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> directed against the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of Georgia, who were strong only in their rocks, their castles, and the winter season; but these obstacles were overcome by the zeal and perseverance of Timour: the rebels submitted to the tribute or the Koran; and if both religions boasted of their martyrs, that name is more justly due to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> prisoners, who were offered the choice of abjuration or death.
 On his descent from the hills, the emperor gave audience to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ambassadors of Bajazet, and opened the hostile correspondence of complaints and menaces, which fermented <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years before the final explosion.
 Between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> jealous and haughty neighbours, the motives of quarrel will seldom be wanting.
 The <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> and <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> conquests now touched each other in the neighbourhood of Erzerum, and the Euphrates; nor had the doubtful limit been ascertained by time and treaty.
 Each of these ambitious monarchs might accuse his rival of violating his territory, of threatening his vassals, and protecting his rebels; and, by the name of rebels, each understood the fugitive princes, whose kingdoms he had usurped, and whose life or liberty he implacably pursued.
 The resemblance of character was still more dangerous than the opposition of interest; and in their victorious career, <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> was impatient of an equal, and <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> was ignorant of a superior.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> epistle (28) of the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> emperor must have provoked, instead of reconciling, the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan, whose family and nation he affected to despise.
 (29) In his replies, <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> poured forth the indignation of a soul which was deeply stung by such unusual contempt.
 After retorting the basest reproaches on the thief and rebel of the desert, the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> recapitulates his boasted victories in Iran, Touran, and the Indies; and labours to prove, that <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> had never triumphed unless by his own perfidy and the vices of his foes.
The ungovernable rage of the sultan at length betrayed him to an insult of a more domestic kind.
 Any violation by word or deed of the secrecy of the harem is an unpardonable offence among the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> nations; (31) and the political quarrel of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> monarchs was embittered by private and personal resentment.
 Yet in his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> expedition, <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> was satisfied with the siege and destruction of <GPE>Siwas</GPE> or Sebaste, a strong city on the borders of Anatolia; and he revenged the indiscretion of the Ottoman, on a garrison of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand Armenians, who were buried alive for the brave and faithful discharge of their duty.
 As a Mussulman, he seemed to respect the pious occupation of Bajazet, who was still engaged in the blockade of Constantinople; and after this salutary lesson, the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> conqueror checked his pursuit, and turned aside to the invasion of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Egypt.
 In these transactions, the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> prince, by the Orientals, and even by Timour, is styled the Kaissar of Roum, the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> of the Romans; a title which, by a small anticipation, might be given to a monarch who possessed the provinces, and threatened the city, of the successors of Constantine.
 (32) <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> invades Syria, A.
D.
 1400.
 The military republic of the <NORP>Mamalukes</NORP> still reigned in <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Syria: but the dynasty of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> was overthrown by that of the Circassians; (33) and their favourite Barkok, from a slave and a prisoner, was raised and restored to the throne.
 In the midst of rebellion and discord, he braved the menaces, corresponded with the enemies, and detained the ambassadors, of the Mogul, who patiently expected his decease, to revenge the crimes of the father on the feeble reign of his son Farage.
 The <NORP>Syrian</NORP> emirs (34) were assembled at <GPE>Aleppo</GPE> to repel the invasion: they confided in the fame and discipline of the Mamalukes, in the temper of their swords and lances of the purest steel of Damascus, in the strength of their walled cities, and in the populousness of sixty thousand villages; and instead of sustaining a siege, they threw open their gates, and arrayed their forces in the plain.
 But these forces were not cemented by virtue and union; and some powerful emirs had been seduced to desert or betray their more loyal companions.
 Timour's front was covered with a line of <NORP>Indian</NORP> elephants, whose turrets were filled with archers and <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire: the rapid evolutions of his cavalry completed the dismay and disorder; the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> crowds fell back on each other: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> were stifled or slaughtered in the entrance of the great street; the <ORG>Moguls</ORG> entered with the fugitives; Sacks Aleppo, A.
D.
 1400, Nov.
 11.
 and after a short defence, the citadel, the impregnable citadel of Aleppo, was surrendered by cowardice or treachery.
 Among the suppliants and captives, <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> distinguished the doctors of the law, whom he invited to the dangerous honour of a personal conference.
 (35) The <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> prince was a zealous Mussulman; but his <NORP>Persian</NORP> schools had taught him to revere the memory of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> and Hosein; and he had imbibed a deep prejudice against the Syrians, as the enemies of the son of the daughter of the apostle of God.
 To these doctors he proposed a captious question, which the casuists of Bochara, Samarcand, and Herat, were incapable of resolving.
 But he was silenced, or satisfied, by the dexterity of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the cadhis of Aleppo, who replied in the words of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> himself, that the motive, not the ensign, constitutes the martyr; and that the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> of either party, who fight only for the glory of God, may deserve that sacred appellation.
 The true succession of the caliphs was a controversy of a still more delicate nature; and the frankness of a doctor, too honest for his situation, provoked the emperor to exclaim, A prudent explanation restored his tranquillity; and he passed to a more familiar topic of conversation.
 During this peaceful conversation the streets of <GPE>Aleppo</GPE> streamed with blood, and re-echoed with the cries of mothers and children, with the shrieks of violated virgins.
 The rich plunder that was abandoned to his soldiers might stimulate their avarice; but their cruelty was enforced by the peremptory command of producing an adequate number of heads, which, according to his custom, were curiously piled in columns and pyramids: the <ORG>Moguls</ORG> celebrated the feast of victory, while the surviving <NORP>Moslems</NORP> passed the night in tears and in chains.
 I shall not dwell on the march of the destroyer from <GPE>Aleppo</GPE> to Damascus, where he was rudely encountered, and almost overthrown, by the armies of Egypt.
 A retrograde motion was imputed to his distress and despair: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his nephews deserted to the enemy; and <GPE>Syria</GPE> rejoiced in the tale of his defeat, when the sultan was driven by the revolt of the <NORP>Mamalukes</NORP> to escape with precipitation and shame to his palace of Cairo.
 Abandoned by their prince, the inhabitants of <GPE>Damascus</GPE> still defended their walls; and <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> consented to raise the siege, if they would adorn his retreat with a gift or ransom; each article of <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> pieces.
 Damascus, A.
D.
 1401, January 23.
 But no sooner had he introduced himself into the city, under colour of a truce, than he perfidiously violated the treaty; imposed a contribution of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of gold; and animated his troops to chastise the posterity of those <NORP>Syrians</NORP> who had executed, or approved, the murder of the grandson of Mahomet.
 A family which had given honourable burial to the head of Hosein, and a colony of artificers, whom he sent to labor at Samarcand, were alone reserved in the general massacre, and after a period of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> centuries, <GPE>Damascus</GPE> was reduced to ashes, because a <NORP>Tartar</NORP> was moved by religious zeal to avenge the blood of an Arab.
 The losses and fatigues of the campaign obliged <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> to renounce the conquest of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> and Egypt; but in his return to the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> he delivered <GPE>Aleppo</GPE> to the flames; and justified his pious motive by the pardon and reward of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand sectaries of Ali, who were desirous to visit the tomb of his son.
 I have expatiated on the personal anecdotes which mark the character of the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> hero; and Bagdad, A.
D.
 1401, July 23.
 but I shall briefly mention, (36) that he erected on the ruins of <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> a pyramid of ninety thousand heads; again visited Georgia; encamped on the banks of Araxes; and proclaimed his resolution of marching against the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> emperor.
 Conscious of the importance of the war, he collected his forces from every province: <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> hundred thousand men were enrolled on his military list; (37) but the splendid commands of five, and ten, thousand horse, may be rather expressive of the rank and pension of the chiefs, than of the genuine number of effective soldiers.
 (38) In the pillage of Syria, the <ORG>Moguls</ORG> had acquired immense riches: but the delivery of their pay and arrears for <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years more firmly attached them to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> standard.
 Invades Anatolia, A.
D.
 1402.
 During this diversion of the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> arms, <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> had <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years to collect his forces for a more serious encounter.
 They consisted of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred thousand horse and foot, (39) whose merit and fidelity were of an unequal complexion.
 We may discriminate the Janizaries, who have been gradually raised to an establishment of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> thousand men; a national cavalry, the <NORP>Spahis</NORP> of modern times; twenty thousand cuirassiers of Europe, clad in black and impenetrable armour; the troops of Anatolia, whose princes had taken refuge in the camp of Timour, and a colony of Tartars, whom he had driven from Kipzak, and to whom <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> had assigned a settlement in the plains of Adrianople.
 The fearless confidence of the sultan urged him to meet his antagonist; and, as if he had chosen that spot for revenge, he displayed his banner near the ruins of the unfortunate Suvas.
 In the mean while, <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> moved from the <NORP>Araxes</NORP> through the countries of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and Anatolia: his boldness was secured by the wisest precautions; his speed was guided by order and discipline; and the woods, the mountains, and the rivers, were diligently explored by the flying squadrons, who marked his road and preceded his standard.
 Firm in his plan of fighting in the heart of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> kingdom, he avoided their camp; dexterously inclined to the left; occupied Caesarea; traversed the salt desert and the River Halys; and invested Angora: while the sultan, immovable and ignorant in his post, compared the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> swiftness to the crawling of a snail; (40) he returned on the wings of indignation to the relief of Angora: Battle of Angora, A.
D.
 1402, July 28.
 and as both generals were alike impatient for action, the plains round that city were the scene of a memorable battle, which has immortalized the glory of <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> and the shame of Bajazet.
 For this signal victory the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> emperor was indebted to himself, to the genius of the moment, and the discipline of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years.
 He had improved the tactics, without violating the manners, of his nation, (41) whose force still consisted in the missile weapons, and rapid evolutions, of a numerous cavalry.
 From a single troop to a great army, the mode of attack was the same: a foremost line <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advanced to the charge, and was supported in a just order by the squadrons of the great vanguard.
 The general's eye watched over the field, and at his command the front and rear of the right and left wings successively moved forwards in their several divisions, and in a direct or oblique line: the enemy was pressed by eighteen or twenty attacks; and each attack afforded a chance of victory.
 If they all proved fruitless or unsuccessful, the occasion was worthy of the emperor himself, who gave the signal of advancing to the standard and main body, which he led in person.
 (42) But in the battle of Angora, the main body itself was supported, on the flanks and in the rear, by the bravest squadrons of the reserve, commanded by the sons and grandsons of Timour.
 The conqueror of <GPE>Hindostan</GPE> ostentatiously showed a line of elephants, the trophies, rather than the instruments, of victory; the use of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire was familiar to the <ORG>Moguls</ORG> and Ottomans; but had they borrowed from <LOC>Europe</LOC> the recent invention of gunpowder and cannon, the artificial thunder, in the hands of either nation, must have turned the fortune of the day.
 (43) In that day <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> displayed the qualities of a soldier and a chief: but his genius sunk under a stronger ascendant; and, from various motives, the greatest part of his troops failed him in the decisive moment.
 His rigour and avarice had provoked a mutiny among the Turks; and even his son <PERSON>Soliman</PERSON> too hastily withdrew from the field.
 The forces of Anatolia, loyal in their revolt, were drawn away to the banners of their lawful princes.
 His <NORP>Tartar</NORP> allies had been tempted by the letters and emissaries of Timour; (44) who reproached their ignoble servitude under the slaves of their fathers; and offered to their hopes the dominion of their new, or the liberty of their ancient, country.
 In the right wing of <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> the cuirassiers of <LOC>Europe</LOC> charged, with faithful hearts and irresistible arms: but these men of iron were soon broken by an artful flight and headlong pursuit; and the Janizaries, alone, without cavalry or missile weapons, were encompassed by the circle of the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> hunters.
 Their valour was at length oppressed by heat, thirst, and the weight of numbers; and the unfortunate sultan, afflicted with the gout in his hands and feet, was transported from the field on the fleetest of his horses.
Defeat and captivity of Bajazet.
 He was pursued and taken by the titular khan of Zagatai; and, after his capture, and the defeat of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> powers, the kingdom of <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> submitted to the conqueror, who planted his standard at Kiotahia, and dispersed on all sides the ministers of rapine and destruction.
 Mirza Mehemmed Sultan, the eldest and best beloved of his grandsons, was despatched to Boursa, with <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand horse; and such was his youthful ardour, that he arrived with only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand at the gates of the capital, after performing in <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> days a march of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> miles.
 Yet fear is still more rapid in its course; and Soliman, the son of Bajazet, had already passed over to <LOC>Europe</LOC> with the royal treasure.
 The spoil, however, of the palace and city was immense: the inhabitants had escaped; but the buildings, for the most part of wood, were reduced to ashes From Boursa, the grandson of <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> advanced to Nice, ever yet a fair and flourishing city; and the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> squadrons were only stopped by the waves of the Propontis.
 The same success attended the other mirzas and emirs in their excursions; and Smyrna, defended by the zeal and courage of the <NORP>Rhodian</NORP> knights, alone deserved the presence of the emperor himself.
 After an obstinate defence, the place was taken by storm: all that breathed was put to the sword; and the heads of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> heroes were launched from the engines, on board of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> carracks, or great ships of Europe, that rode at anchor in the harbour.
 The <NORP>Moslems</NORP> of <LOC>Asia</LOC> rejoiced in their deliverance from a dangerous and domestic foe; and a parallel was drawn between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rivals, by observing that Timour, in fourteen days, had reduced a fortress which had sustained <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the siege, or at least the blockade, of Bajazet.
 (45) The story of his iron cage.
 The iron cage in which <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> was imprisoned by Tamerlane, so long and so often repeated as a moral lesson, is now rejected as a fable by the modern writers, who smile at the vulgar credulity.
 (46) They appeal with confidence to the <NORP>Persian</NORP> history of Sherefeddin Ali, which has been given to our curiosity in a <NORP>French</NORP> version, and from which I shall collect and abridge a more specious narrative of this memorable transaction.
 disproved by the <NORP>Persian</NORP> historian of Timour; No sooner was <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> informed that the captive <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> was at the door of his tent, than he graciously stepped forwards to receive him, seated him by his side, and mingled with just reproaches a soothing pity for his rank and misfortune.
 The royal captive showed some signs of repentance, accepted the humiliation of a robe of honour, and embraced with tears his son Mousa, who, at his request, was sought and found among the captives of the field.
 The <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> princes were lodged in a splendid pavilion; and the respect of the guards could be surpassed only by their vigilance.
 On the arrival of the harem from Boursa, <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> restored the queen <PERSON>Despina</PERSON> and her daughter to their father and husband; but he piously required, that the <NORP>Servian</NORP> princess, who had hitherto been indulged in the profession of Christianity, should embrace without delay the religion of the prophet.
 In the feast of victory, to which <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> was invited, the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> emperor placed a crown on his head and a sceptre in his hand, with a solemn assurance of restoring him with an increase of glory to the throne of his ancestors.
 But the effect of his promise was disappointed by the sultan's untimely death: amidst the care of the most skilful physicians, he expired of an apoplexy at Akshehr, the <GPE>Antioch</GPE> of Pisidia, about <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> months after his defeat.
 The victor dropped a tear over his grave: his body, with royal pomp, was conveyed to the mausoleum which he had erected at Boursa; and his son Mousa, after receiving a rich present of gold and jewels, of horses and arms, was invested by a patent in red ink with the kingdom of Anatolia.
 Such is the portrait of a generous conqueror, which has been extracted from his own memorials, and dedicated to his son and grandson, nineteen years after his decease; (47) and, at a time when the truth was remembered by thousands, a manifest falsehood would have implied a satire on his real conduct.
 Weighty indeed is this evidence, adopted by all the <NORP>Persian</NORP> histories; (48) yet flattery, more especially in the East, is base and audacious; and the harsh and ignominious treatment of <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> is attested by a chain of witnesses, some of whom shall be produced in the order of their time and country.
 1.
attested by the French.
 The reader has not forgot the garrison of French, whom the marshal <PERSON>Boucicault</PERSON> left behind him for the defence of Constantinople.
 They were on the spot to receive the earliest and most faithful intelligence of the overthrow of their great adversary; and it is more than probable, that some of them accompanied the <NORP>Greek</NORP> embassy to the camp of Tamerlane.
 From their account, the hardships of the prison and death of <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> are affirmed by the marshal's servant and historian, within the distance of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years.
 (49) 2.
by the Italians.
 The name of <PERSON>Poggius</PERSON> the <NORP>Italian</NORP> (50) is deservedly famous among the revivers of learning in the fifteenth century.
 His elegant dialogue on the vicissitudes of fortune (51) was composed in his fiftieth year, twenty-eight years after the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> victory of Tamerlane; (52) whom he celebrates as not inferior to the illustrious <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of antiquity.
 Of his exploits and discipline <PERSON>Poggius</PERSON> was informed by several ocular witnesses; nor does he forget an example so apposite to his theme as the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> monarch, whom the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> confined like a wild beast in an iron cage, and exhibited a spectacle to Asia.
 I might add the authority of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Italian</NORP> chronicles, perhaps of an earlier date, which would prove at least that the same story, whether false or true, was imported into <LOC>Europe</LOC> with the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tidings of the revolution.
 (53)3.
by the Arabs.
 At the time when <PERSON>Poggius</PERSON> flourished at Rome, Ahmed Ebn Arabshah composed at <GPE>Damascus</GPE> the florid and malevolent history of Timour, for which he had collected materials in his journeys over <GPE>Turkey</GPE> and Tartary.
 (54) Without any possible correspondence between the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> and the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> writer, they agree in the fact of the iron cage; and their agreement is a striking proof of their common veracity.
 Ahmed Arabshah likewise relates another outrage, which <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> endured, of a more domestic and tender nature.
 His indiscreet mention of women and divorces was deeply resented by the jealous Tartar: in the feast of victory the wine was served by female cupbearers, and the sultan beheld his own concubines and wives confounded among the slaves, and exposed without a veil to the eyes of intemperance.
 To escape a similar indignity, it is said that his successors, except in a single instance, have abstained from legitimate nuptials; and the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> practice and belief, at least in the sixteenth century, is asserted by the observing Busbequius, (55) ambassador from the court of <GPE>Vienna</GPE> to the great Soliman.
 4.
by the Greeks.
 Such is the separation of language, that the testimony of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> is not less independent than that of a <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> or an Arab.
 I suppress the names of <PERSON>Chalcondyles</PERSON> and Ducas, who flourished in the latter period, and who speak in a less positive tone; but more attention is due to George Phranza, (56) protovestiare of the last emperors, and who was born a year before the battle of Angora.
 Twenty-two years after that event, he was sent ambassador to <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> the Second; and the historian might converse with some veteran Janizaries, who had been made prisoners with the sultan, and had themselves seen him in his iron cage.
 5.
by the Turks.
 The last evidence, in every sense, is that of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> annals, which have been consulted or transcribed by Leunclavius, Pocock, and Cantemir.
 (57) They unanimously deplore the captivity of the iron cage; and some credit may be allowed to national historians, who cannot stigmatize the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> without uncovering the shame of their king and country.
 Probable conclusion.
 From these opposite premises, a fair and moderate conclusion may be deduced.
 I am satisfied that Sherefeddin <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> has faithfully described the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ostentatious interview, in which the conqueror, whose spirits were harmonized by success, affected the character of generosity.
 But his mind was insensibly alienated by the unseasonable arrogance of Bajazet; the complaints of his enemies, the <NORP>Anatolian</NORP> princes, were just and vehement; and <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> betrayed a design of leading his royal captive in triumph to Samarcand.
 An attempt to facilitate his escape, by digging a mine under the tent, provoked the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> emperor to impose a harsher restraint; and in his perpetual marches, an iron cage on a wagon might be invented, not as a wanton insult, but as a rigorous precaution.
 <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> had read in some fabulous history a similar treatment of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his predecessors, a king of Persia; and <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> was condemned to represent the person, and expiate the guilt, of the Roman Caesar.
 (58) Death of Bajazet, A.
D.
 1403,March 9.
 But the strength of his mind and body fainted under the trial, and his premature death might, without injustice, be ascribed to the severity of Timour.
 He warred not with the dead: a tear and a sepulchre were all that he could bestow on a captive who was delivered from his power; and if Mousa, the son of Bajazet, was permitted to reign over the ruins of Boursa, the greatest part of the province of <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> had been restored by the conqueror to their lawful sovereigns.
 Term of the conquests of Timour, A.
D.
 1403.
 From the <NORP>Irtish</NORP> and <LOC>Volga</LOC> to the <NORP>Persian</NORP> Gulf, and from the <LOC>Ganges</LOC> to <GPE>Damascus</GPE> and the Archipelago, <LOC>Asia</LOC> was in the hand of Timour: his armies were invincible, his ambition was boundless, and his zeal might aspire to conquer and convert the <NORP>Christian</NORP> kingdoms of the West, which already trembled at his name.
 He touched the utmost verge of the land; but an insuperable, though narrow, sea rolled between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> continents of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia; (59) and the lord of so many tomans, or myriads, of horse, was not master of a single galley.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> passages of the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> and Hellespont, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Gallipoli, were possessed, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> by the Christians, the other by the Turks.
 On this great occasion, they forgot the difference of religion, to act with union and firmness in the common cause: the double straits were guarded with ships and fortifications; and they separately withheld the transports which <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> demanded of either nation, under the pretence of attacking their enemy.
 At the same time, they soothed his pride with tributary gifts and suppliant embassies, and prudently tempted him to retreat with the honours of victory.
 Soliman, the son of Bajazet, implored his clemency for his father and himself; accepted, by a red patent, the investiture of the kingdom of Romania, which he already held by the sword; and reiterated his ardent wish, of casting himself in person at the feet of the king of the world.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor (60) (either <PERSON>John</PERSON> or Manuel) submitted to pay the same tribute which he had stipulated with the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan, and ratified the treaty by an oath of allegiance, from which he could absolve his conscience so soon as the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> arms had retired from Anatolia.
 But the fears and fancy of nations ascribed to the ambitious <NORP>Tamerlane</NORP> a new design of vast and romantic compass; a design of subduing <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Africa, marching from the <LOC>Nile</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean, entering <LOC>Europe</LOC> by the Straits of Gibraltar, and, after imposing his yoke on the kingdoms of Christendom, of returning home by the deserts of <GPE>Russia</GPE> and Tartary.
 This remote, and perhaps imaginary, danger was averted by the submission of the sultan of Egypt: the honours of the prayer and the coin attested at <GPE>Cairo</GPE> the supremacy of Timour; and a rare gift of a giraffe, or camelopard, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> ostriches, represented at <GPE>Samarcand</GPE> the tribute of the <NORP>African</NORP> world.
 Our imagination is not less astonished by the portrait of a Mogul, who, in his camp before Smyrna, meditates, and almost accomplishes, the invasion of the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> empire.
 (61) <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> was urged to this enterprise by national honour and religious zeal.
 The torrents which he had shed of <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> blood could be expiated only by an equal destruction of the infidels; and as he now stood at the gates of paradise, he might best secure his glorious entrance by demolishing the idols of China, founding mosques in every city, and establishing the profession of faith in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> God, and his prophet Mahomet.
 The recent expulsion of the house of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> was an insult on the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> name; and the disorders of the empire afforded the fairest opportunity for revenge.
 The illustrious Hongvou, founder of the dynasty of Ming, died <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years before the battle of Angora; and his grandson, a weak and unfortunate youth, was burnt in his palace, after a million of <NORP>Chinese</NORP> had perished in the civil war.
 (62) Before he evacuated Anatolia, <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> despatched beyond the <NORP>Sihoon</NORP> a numerous army, or rather colony, of his old and new subjects, to open the road, to subdue the Pagan <NORP>Calmucks</NORP> and Mungals, and to found cities and magazines in the desert; and, by the diligence of his lieutenant, he soon received a perfect map and description of the unknown regions, from the source of the <NORP>Irtish</NORP> to the wall of China.
 During these preparations, the emperor achieved the final conquest of Georgia; passed the winter on the banks of the Araxes; appeased the troubles of Persia; and slowly returned to his capital, after a campaign of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> months.
 His triumph at Samarcand, A.
D.
 1404, July - 1405, January 8.
 On the throne of Samarcand, (63) he displayed, in a short repose, his magnificence and power; listened to the complaints of the people; distributed a just measure of rewards and punishments; employed his riches in the architecture of palaces and temples; and gave audience to the ambassadors of Egypt, Arabia, India, Tartary, Russia, and Spain, the last of whom presented a suit of tapestry which eclipsed the pencil of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> artists.
 The marriage of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> of the emperor's grandsons was esteemed an act of religion as well as of paternal tenderness; and the pomp of the ancient caliphs was revived in their nuptials.
 They were celebrated in the gardens of Canighul, decorated with innumerable tents and pavilions, which displayed the luxury of a great city and the spoils of a victorious camp.
 Whole forests were cut down to supply fuel for the kitchens; the plain was spread with pyramids of meat, and vases of every liquor, to which <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of guests were courteously invited: the orders of the state, and the nations of the earth, were marshalled at the royal banquet; nor were the ambassadors of <LOC>Europe</LOC> (says the haughty Persian) excluded from the feast; since even the casses, the smallest of fish, find their place in the ocean.
 (64) The public joy was testified by illuminations and masquerades; the trades of <GPE>Samarcand</GPE> passed in review; and every trade was emulous to execute some quaint device, some marvellous pageant, with the materials of their peculiar art.
 After the marriage contracts had been ratified by the cadhis, the bride-grooms and their brides retired to the nuptial chambers: <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> times, according to the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> fashion, they were dressed and undressed; and at each change of apparel, pearls and rubies were showered on their heads, and contemptuously abandoned to their attendants.
 A general indulgence was proclaimed: every law was relaxed, every pleasure was allowed; the people was free, the sovereign was idle; and the historian of <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> may remark, that, after devoting fifty years to the attainment of empire, the only happy period of his life were the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months in which he ceased to exercise his power.
 But he was soon awakened to the cares of government and war.
 The standard was unfurled for the invasion of China: the emirs made their report of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand, the select and veteran soldiers of <GPE>Iran</GPE> and Touran: their baggage and provisions were transported by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred great wagons, and an immense train of horses and camels; and the troops might prepare for a long absence, since more than <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months were employed in the tranquil journey of a caravan from <GPE>Samarcand</GPE> to Pekin.
 Neither age, nor the severity of the winter, could retard the impatience of Timour; he mounted on horseback, passed the <NORP>Sihoon</NORP> on the ice, marched seventy-six parasangs, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred miles, from his capital, and pitched his last camp in the neighbourhood of Otrar, where he was expected by the angel of death.
 His death on the road to China, A.
D.
 1405, <DATE>April</DATE> 1.
 Fatigue, and the indiscreet use of iced water, accelerated the progress of his fever; and the conqueror of <LOC>Asia</LOC> expired in the seventieth year of his age, <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> years after he had ascended the throne of Zagatai.
 His designs were lost; his armies were disbanded; <GPE>China</GPE> was saved; and fourteen years after his decease, the most powerful of his children sent an embassy of friendship and commerce to the court of Pekin.
 (65) Character and merits of Timour.
 The fame of <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> has pervaded the <LOC>East</LOC> and West: his posterity is still invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> title; and the admiration of his subjects, who revered him almost as a deity, may be justified in some degree by the praise or confession of his bitterest enemies.
 (66) Although he was lame of a hand and foot, his form and stature were not unworthy of his rank; and his vigorous health, so essential to himself and to the world, was corroborated by temperance and exercise.
 In his familiar discourse he was grave and modest, and if he was ignorant of the <LANGUAGE>Arabic</LANGUAGE> language, he spoke with fluency and elegance the <NORP>Persian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> idioms.
 It was his delight to converse with the learned on topics of history and science; and the amusement of his leisure hours was the game of chess, which he improved or corrupted with new refinements.
 (67) In his religion he was a zealous, though not perhaps an orthodox, Mussulman; (68) but his sound understanding may tempt us to believe, that a superstitious reverence for omens and prophecies, for saints and astrologers, was only affected as an instrument of policy.
 In the government of a vast empire, he stood alone and absolute, without a rebel to oppose his power, a favourite to seduce his affections, or a minister to mislead his judgment.
 It was his firmest maxim, that whatever might be the consequence, the word of the prince should never be disputed or recalled; but his foes have maliciously observed, that the commands of anger and destruction were more strictly executed than those of beneficence and favour.
 His sons and grandsons, of whom <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> left <DATE>six-and-thirty</DATE> at his decease, were his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most submissive subjects; and whenever they deviated from their duty, they were corrected, according to the laws of Zingis, with the bastinade, and afterwards restored to honour and command.
 Perhaps his heart was not devoid of the social virtues; perhaps he was not incapable of loving his friends and pardoning his enemies; but the rules of morality are founded on the public interest; and it may be sufficient to applaud the wisdom of a monarch, for the liberality by which he is not impoverished, and for the justice by which he is strengthened and enriched.
 To maintain the harmony of authority and obedience, to chastise the proud, to protect the weak, to reward the deserving, to banish vice and idleness from his dominions, to secure the traveller and merchant, to restrain the depredations of the soldier, to cherish the labours of the husbandman, to encourage industry and learning, and, by an equal and moderate assessment, to increase the revenue, without increasing the taxes, are indeed the duties of a prince; but, in the discharge of these duties, he finds an ample and immediate recompense.
 <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> might boast, that, at his accession to the throne, <LOC>Asia</LOC> was the prey of anarchy and rapine, whilst under his prosperous monarchy a child, fearless and unhurt, might carry a purse of gold from the <LOC>East</LOC> to the West.
 Such was his confidence of merit, that from this reformation he derived an excuse for his victories, and a title to universal dominion.
 The <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> following observations will serve to appreciate his claim to the public gratitude; and perhaps we shall conclude, that the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> emperor was rather the scourge than the benefactor of mankind.
 1.
 If some partial disorders, some local oppressions, were healed by the sword of Timour, the remedy was far more pernicious than the disease.
 By their rapine, cruelty, and discord, the petty tyrants of <GPE>Persia</GPE> might afflict their subjects; but whole nations were crushed under the footsteps of the reformer.
 The ground which had been occupied by flourishing cities was often marked by his abominable trophies, by columns, or pyramids, of human heads.
 Astracan, Carizme, Delhi, Ispahan, Bagdad, Aleppo, Damascus, Boursa, Smyrna, and a thousand others, were sacked, or burnt, or utterly destroyed, in his presence, and by his troops: and perhaps his conscience would have been startled, if a priest or philosopher had dared to number the <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of victims whom he had sacrificed to the establishment of peace and order.
 (69) <CARDINAL>2.
</CARDINAL> His most destructive wars were rather inroads than conquests.
 He invaded Turkestan, Kipzak, Russia, Hindostan, Syria, Anatolia, Armenia, and Georgia, without a hope or a desire of preserving those distant provinces.
 From thence he departed laden with spoil; but he left behind him neither troops to awe the contumacious, nor magistrates to protect the obedient, natives.
 When he had broken the fabric of their ancient government, he abandoned them to the evils which his invasion had aggravated or caused; nor were these evils compensated by any present or possible benefits.
 3.
 The kingdoms of <NORP>Transoxiana</NORP> and <GPE>Persia</GPE> were the proper field which he labored to cultivate and adorn, as the perpetual inheritance of his family.
 But his peaceful labours were often interrupted, and sometimes blasted, by the absence of the conqueror.
 While he triumphed on the <LOC>Volga</LOC> or the Ganges, his servants, and even his sons, forgot their master and their duty.
 The public and private injuries were poorly redressed by the tardy rigour of inquiry and punishment; and we must be content to praise the Institutions of Timour, as the specious idea of a perfect monarchy.
 4.
 Whatsoever might be the blessings of his administration, they evaporated with his life.
 To reign, rather than to govern, was the ambition of his children and grandchildren; (70) the enemies of each other and of the people.
 A fragment of the empire was upheld with some glory by Sharokh, his youngest son; but after his decease, the scene was again involved in darkness and blood; and before the end of a century, <NORP>Transoxiana</NORP> and <GPE>Persia</GPE> were trampled by the <NORP>Uzbeks</NORP> from the north, and the <NORP>Turkmans</NORP> of the black and white sheep.
 The race of <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> would have been extinct, if a hero, his descendant in the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> degree, had not fled before the <NORP>Uzbek</NORP> arms to the conquest of Hindostan.
 His successors (the great <ORG>Moguls</ORG> (71)) extended their sway from the mountains of <GPE>Cashmir</GPE> to Cape Comorin, and from <GPE>Candahar</GPE> to the Gulf of Bengal.
 Since the reign of Aurungzebe, their empire had been dissolved; their treasures of <GPE>Delhi</GPE> have been rifled by a <NORP>Persian</NORP> robber; and the richest of their kingdoms is now possessed by a company of <NORP>Christian</NORP> merchants, of a remote island in the Northern Ocean.
 Civil wars of the sons of Bajazet, A.
D.
 1403-1421.
 Far different was the fate of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> monarchy.
 The massy trunk was bent to the ground, but no sooner did the hurricane pass away, than it again rose with fresh vigour and more lively vegetation.
 When Timour, in every sense, had evacuated Anatolia, he left the cities without a palace, a treasure, or a king.
 The open country was overspread with hordes of shepherds and robbers of <NORP>Tartar</NORP> or <NORP>Turkman</NORP> origin; the recent conquests of <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> were restored to the emirs, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of whom, in base revenge, demolished his sepulchre; and his <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> sons were eager, by civil discord, to consume the remnant of their patrimony.
 I shall enumerate their names in the order of their age and actions.
 (72) 1.
Mustapha; It is doubtful, whether I relate the story of the true Mustapha, or of an impostor who personated that lost prince.
 He fought by his father's side in the battle of Angora: but when the captive sultan was permitted to inquire for his children, <PERSON>Mousa</PERSON> alone could be found; and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> historians, the slaves of the triumphant faction, are persuaded that his brother was confounded among the slain.
 If <PERSON>Mustapha</PERSON> escaped from that disastrous field, he was concealed twelve years from his friends and enemies; till he emerged in Thessaly, and was hailed by a numerous party, as the son and successor of Bajazet.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> defeat would have been his last, had not the true, or false, <PERSON>Mustapha</PERSON> been saved by the Greeks, and restored, after the decease of his brother Mahomet, to liberty and empire.
 A degenerate mind seemed to argue his spurious birth; and if, on the throne of Adrianople, he was adored as the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> sultan, his flight, his fetters, and an ignominious gibbet, delivered the impostor to popular contempt.
 A similar character and claim was asserted by several rival pretenders: <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> persons are said to have suffered under the name of Mustapha; and these frequent executions may perhaps insinuate, that the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> court was not perfectly secure of the death of the lawful prince.

Isa; After his father's captivity, <PERSON>Isa</PERSON> (73) reigned for some time in the neighbourhood of Angora, Sinope, and the Black Sea; and his ambassadors were dismissed from the presence of <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> with fair promises and honourable gifts.
 But their master was soon deprived of his province and life, by a jealous brother, the sovereign of Amasia; and the final event suggested a pious allusion, that the law of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and Jesus, of <PERSON>Isa</PERSON> and Mousa, had been abrogated by the greater Mahomet.

Soliman, A.
D.
 1403-1410.
 <PERSON>Soliman</PERSON> is not numbered in the list of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> emperors: yet he checked the victorious progress of the Moguls; and after their departure, united for a while the thrones of <GPE>Adrianople</GPE> and Boursa.
 In war he was brave, active, and fortunate; his courage was softened by clemency; but it was likewise inflamed by presumption, and corrupted by intemperance and idleness.
 He relaxed the nerves of discipline, in a government where either the subject or the sovereign must continually tremble: his vices alienated the chiefs of the army and the law; and his daily drunkenness, so contemptible in a prince and a man, was doubly odious in a disciple of the prophet.
 In the slumber of intoxication he was surprised by his brother Mousa; and as he fled from <GPE>Adrianople</GPE> towards the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital, <PERSON>Soliman</PERSON> was overtaken and slain in a bath, after a reign of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> months.

Mousa,A.
D.
 1410 The investiture of <PERSON>Mousa</PERSON> degraded him as the slave of the Moguls: his tributary kingdom of <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> was confined within a narrow limit, nor could his broken militia and empty treasury contend with the hardy and veteran bands of the sovereign of Romania.
 <PERSON>Mousa</PERSON> fled in disguise from the palace of Boursa; traversed the <LOC>Propontis</LOC> in an open boat; wandered over the <LOC>Walachian</LOC> and <NORP>Servian</NORP> hills; and after some vain attempts, ascended the throne of Adrianople, so recently stained with the blood of Soliman.
 In a reign of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years and a half, his troops were victorious against the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> and the Morea; but <PERSON>Mousa</PERSON> was ruined by his timorous disposition and unseasonable clemency.
 After resigning the sovereignty of Anatolia, he fell a victim to the perfidy of his ministers, and the superior ascendant of his brother Mahomet.
 5.
Mahomet I.
 A.
D.
 1413-1421.
 The final victory of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was the just recompense of his prudence and moderation.
 Before his father's captivity, the royal youth had been intrusted with the government of Amasia, <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> days' journey from Constantinople, and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> frontier against the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of <GPE>Trebizond</GPE> and Georgia.
 The castle, in <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> warfare, was esteemed impregnable; and the city of Amasia, (74) which is equally divided by the River Iris, rises on either side in the form of an amphitheatre, and represents on a smaller scale the image of Bagdad.
 In his rapid career, <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> appears to have overlooked this obscure and contumacious angle of Anatolia; and Mahomet, without provoking the conqueror, maintained his silent independence, and chased from the province the last stragglers of the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> host.
 He relieved himself from the dangerous neighbourhood of Isa; but in the contests of their more powerful brethren his firm neutrality was respected; till, after the triumph of Mousa, he stood forth the heir and avenger of the unfortunate Soliman.
 <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> obtained <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> by treaty, and <GPE>Romania</GPE> by arms; and the soldier who presented him with the head of <PERSON>Mousa</PERSON> was rewarded as the benefactor of his king and country.
 The <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> years of his sole and peaceful reign were usefully employed in banishing the vices of civil discord, and restoring on a firmer basis the fabric of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> monarchy.
 His last care was the choice of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> viziers, <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> and Ibrahim, (75) who might guide the youth of his son Amurath; Reign of <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> II.

D.
 1421-1451, February 9.
 and such was their union and prudence, that they concealed above <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> days the emperor's death, till the arrival of his successor in the palace of Boursa.
 A new war was kindled in <LOC>Europe</LOC> by the prince, or impostor, Mustapha; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> vizier lost his army and his head; but the more fortunate Ibrahim, whose name and family are still revered, extinguished the last pretender to the throne of Bajazet, and closed the scene of domestic hostility.
 Reunion of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1421.
 In these conflicts, the wisest Turks, and indeed the body of the nation, were strongly attached to the unity of the empire; and <GPE>Romania</GPE> and Anatolia, so often torn asunder by private ambition, were animated by a strong and invincible tendency of cohesion.
 Their efforts might have instructed the <NORP>Christian</NORP> powers; and had they occupied, with a confederate fleet, the Straits of Gallipoli, the Ottomans, at least in Europe, must have been speedily annihilated.
 But the schism of the West, and the factions and wars of <GPE>France</GPE> and England, diverted the <NORP>Latins</NORP> from this generous enterprise: they enjoyed the present respite, without a thought of futurity; and were often tempted by a momentary interest to serve the common enemy of their religion.
 A colony of Genoese, (76) which had been planted at <GPE>Phocaea</GPE> (77) on the <NORP>Ionian</NORP> coast, was enriched by the lucrative monopoly of alum; (78) and their tranquillity, under the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> empire, was secured by the <DATE>annual</DATE> payment of tribute.
 In the last civil war of the Ottomans, the <PERSON>Genoese</PERSON> governor, Adorno, a bold and ambitious youth, embraced the party of Amurath; and undertook, with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> stout galleys, to transport him from <LOC>Asia</LOC> to Europe.
 The sultan and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred guards embarked on board the admiral's ship; which was manned by <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> hundred of the bravest Franks.
 His life and liberty were in their hands; nor can we, without reluctance, applaud the fidelity of Adorno, who, in the midst of the passage, knelt before him, and gratefully accepted a discharge of his arrears of tribute.
 They landed in sight of <PERSON>Mustapha</PERSON> and Gallipoli; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand Italians, armed with lances and battle-axes, attended <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> to the conquest of Adrianople; and this venal service was soon repaid by the ruin of the commerce and colony of Phocaea.
 State of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1402-1425.
 If <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> had generously marched at the request, and to the relief, of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor, he might be entitled to the praise and gratitude of the Christians.
 (79) But a Mussulman, who carried into <GPE>Georgia</GPE> the sword of persecution, and respected the holy warfare of Bajazet, was not disposed to pity or succour the idolaters of Europe.
 The <NORP>Tartar</NORP> followed the impulse of ambition; and the deliverance of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was the accidental consequence.
 When <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> abdicated the government, it was his prayer, rather than his hope, that the ruin of the church and state might be delayed beyond his unhappy days; and after his return from a western pilgrimage, he expected every hour the news of the sad catastrophe.
 On a sudden, he was astonished and rejoiced by the intelligence of the retreat, the overthrow, and the captivity of the Ottoman.
 <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> (80) immediately sailed from <GPE>Modon</GPE> in the Morea; ascended the throne of Constantinople, and dismissed his blind competitor to an easy exile in the Isle of Lesbos.
 The ambassadors of the son of <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> were soon introduced to his presence; but their pride was fallen, their tone was modest: they were awed by the just apprehension, lest the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> should open to the <ORG>Moguls</ORG> the gates of Europe.
 <PERSON>Soliman</PERSON> saluted the emperor by the name of father; solicited at his hands the government or gift of Romania; and promised to deserve his favour by inviolable friendship, and the restitution of Thessalonica, with the most important places along the Strymon, the Propontis, and the Black Sea.
 The alliance of <PERSON>Soliman</PERSON> exposed the emperor to the enmity and revenge of Mousa: the <NORP>Turks</NORP> appeared in arms before the gates of Constantinople; but they were repulsed by sea and land; and unless the city was guarded by some foreign mercenaries, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> must have wondered at their own triumph.
 But, instead of prolonging the division of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> powers, the policy or passion of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was tempted to assist the most formidable of the sons of Bajazet.
 He concluded a treaty with Mahomet, whose progress was checked by the insuperable barrier of Gallipoli: the sultan and his troops were transported over the Bosphorus; he was hospitably entertained in the capital; and his successful sally was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> step to the conquest of Romania.
 The ruin was suspended by the prudence and moderation of the conqueror: he faithfully discharged his own obligations and those of Soliman, respected the laws of gratitude and peace; and left the emperor guardian of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> younger sons, in the vain hope of saving them from the jealous cruelty of their brother Amurath.
 But the execution of his last testament would have offended the national honour and religion; and the divan unanimously pronounced, that the royal youths should never be abandoned to the custody and education of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> dog.
 On this refusal, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> councils were divided; but the age and caution of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> yielded to the presumption of his son John; and they unsheathed a dangerous weapon of revenge, by dismissing the true or false Mustapha, who had long been detained as a captive and hostage, and for whose maintenance they received an <DATE>annual</DATE> pension of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred thousand aspers.
 (81) At the door of his prison, <PERSON>Mustapha</PERSON> subscribed to every proposal; and the keys of Gallipoli, or rather of Europe, were stipulated as the price of his deliverance.
 But no sooner was he seated on the throne of Romania, than he dismissed the <NORP>Greek</NORP> ambassadors with a smile of contempt, declaring, in a pious tone, that, at the day of judgment, he would rather answer for the violation of an oath, than for the surrender of a <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> city into the hands of the infidels.
 The emperor was at once the enemy of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rivals; from whom he had sustained, and to whom he had offered, an injury; and the victory of <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> was followed, in the ensuing spring, by the siege of Constantinople.
 (82) Siege of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> II.
 A.
D.
 1422 June 10-August 24.
 The religious merit of subduing the city of the <LOC>Caesars</LOC> attracted from <LOC>Asia</LOC> a crowd of volunteers, who aspired to the crown of martyrdom: their military ardour was inflamed by the promise of rich spoils and beautiful females; and the sultan's ambition was consecrated by the presence and prediction of Seid Bechar, a descendant of the prophet, (83) who arrived in the camp, on a mule, with a venerable train of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred disciples.
 But he might blush, if a fanatic could blush, at the failure of his assurances.
 The strength of the walls resisted an army of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand Turks; their assaults were repelled by the sallies of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and their foreign mercenaries; the old resources of defence were opposed to the new engines of attack; and the enthusiasm of the dervis, who was snatched to heaven in visionary converse with Mahomet, was answered by the credulity of the Christians, who beheld the <PERSON>Virgin</PERSON> Mary, in a violet garment, walking on the rampart and animating their courage.
 (84) After a siege of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months, <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> was recalled to <GPE>Boursa</GPE> by a domestic revolt, which had been kindled by <NORP>Greek</NORP> treachery, and was soon extinguished by the death of a guiltless brother.
 While he led his <NORP>Janizaries</NORP> to new conquests in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire was indulged in a servile and precarious respite of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years.

 and <PERSON>John</PERSON> Palaeologus was permitted to reign, for an <DATE>annual</DATE> tribute of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred thousand aspers, and the dereliction of almost all that he held beyond the suburbs of Constantinople.
 Hereditary succession and merit of the Ottomans.
 In the establishment and restoration of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> empire, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> merit must doubtless be assigned to the personal qualities of the sultans; since, in human life, the most important scenes will depend on the character of a single actor.
 By some shades of wisdom and virtue, they may be discriminated from each other; but, except in a single instance, a period of <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> reigns, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty-five years, is occupied, from the elevation of <PERSON>Othman</PERSON> to the death of Soliman, by a rare series of warlike and active princes, who impressed their subjects with obedience and their enemies with terror.
 Instead of the slothful luxury of the seraglio, the heirs of royalty were educated in the council and the field: from early youth they were intrusted by their fathers with the command of provinces and armies; and this manly institution, which was often productive of civil war, must have essentially contributed to the discipline and vigour of the monarchy.
 The <NORP>Ottomans</NORP> cannot style themselves, like the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> caliphs, the descendants or successors of the apostle of God; and the kindred which they claim with the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> khans of the house of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> appears to be founded in flattery rather than in truth.
 (85) Their origin is obscure; but their sacred and indefeasible right, which no time can erase, and no violence can infringe, was soon and unalterably implanted in the minds of their subjects.
 A weak or vicious sultan may be deposed and strangled; but his inheritance devolves to an infant or an idiot: nor has the most daring rebel presumed to ascend the throne of his lawful sovereign.
 (86) While the transient dynasties of <LOC>Asia</LOC> have been continually subverted by a crafty vizier in the palace, or a victorious general in the camp, the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> succession has been confirmed by the practice of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> centuries, and is now incorporated with the vital principle of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> nation.
Education and discipline of the Turks.
 To the spirit and constitution of that nation, a strong and singular influence may, however, be ascribed.
 The primitive subjects of <PERSON>Othman</PERSON> were the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred families of wandering Turkmans, who had followed his ancestors from the <LOC>Oxus</LOC> to the Sangar; and the plains of <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> are still covered with the white and black tents of their rustic brethren.
 But this original drop was dissolved in the mass of voluntary and vanquished subjects, who, under the name of Turks, are united by the common ties of religion, language, and manners.
 In the cities, from <GPE>Erzeroum</GPE> to Belgrade, that national appellation is common to all the Moslems, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most honourable inhabitants; but they have abandoned, at least in Romania, the villages, and the cultivation of the land, to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> peasants.
 In the vigorous age of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> government, the <NORP>Turks</NORP> were themselves excluded from all civil and military honours; and a servile class, an artificial people, was raised by the discipline of education to obey, to conquer, and to command.
 (87) From the time of <PERSON>Orchan</PERSON> and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Amurath, the sultans were persuaded that a government of the sword must be renewed in each generation with new soldiers; and that such soldiers must be sought, not in effeminate Asia, but among the hardy and warlike natives of Europe.
 The provinces of Thrace, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, and Servia, became the perpetual seminary of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> army; and when the royal <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> of the captives was diminished by conquest, an inhuman tax of the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> child, or of every <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> year, was rigorously levied on the <NORP>Christian</NORP> families.
 At the age of twelve or fourteen years, the most robust youths were torn from their parents; their names were enrolled in a book; and from that moment they were clothed, taught, and maintained, for the public service.
 According to the promise of their appearance, they were selected for the royal schools of Boursa, Pera, and Adrianople, intrusted to the care of the bashaws, or dispersed in the houses of the <NORP>Anatolian</NORP> peasantry.
 It was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> care of their masters to instruct them in the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> language: their bodies were exercised by every labor that could fortify their strength; they learned to wrestle, to leap, to run, to shoot with the bow, and afterwards with the musket; till they were drafted into the chambers and companies of the Janizaries, and severely trained in the military or monastic discipline of the order.
 The youths most conspicuous for birth, talents, and beauty, were admitted into the inferior class of Agiamoglans, or the more liberal rank of Ichoglans, of whom the former were attached to the palace, and the latter to the person, of the prince.
 In <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> successive schools, under the rod of the white eunuchs, the arts of horsemanship and of darting the javelin were their daily exercise, while those of a more studious cast applied themselves to the study of the Koran, and the knowledge of the <LANGUAGE>Arabic</LANGUAGE> and <NORP>Persian</NORP> tongues.
 As they advanced in seniority and merit, they were gradually dismissed to military, civil, and even ecclesiastical employments: the longer their stay, the higher was their expectation; till, at a mature period, they were admitted into the number of the <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> agas, who stood before the sultan, and were promoted by his choice to the government of provinces and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> honours of the empire.
 (88) Such a mode of institution was admirably adapted to the form and spirit of a despotic monarchy.
 The ministers and generals were, in the strictest sense, the slaves of the emperor, to whose bounty they were indebted for their instruction and support.
 When they left the seraglio, and suffered their beards to grow as the symbol of enfranchisement, they found themselves in an important office, without faction or friendship, without parents and without heirs, dependent on the hand which had raised them from the dust, and which, on the slightest displeasure, could break in pieces these statues of glass, as they were aptly termed by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> proverb.
 (89) In the slow and painful steps of education, their characters and talents were unfolded to a discerning eye: the man, naked and alone, was reduced to the standard of his personal merit; and, if the sovereign had wisdom to choose, he possessed a pure and boundless liberty of choice.
 The <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> candidates were trained by the virtues of abstinence to those of action; by the habits of submission to those of command.
 A similar spirit was diffused among the troops; and their silence and sobriety, their patience and modesty, have extorted the reluctant praise of their <NORP>Christian</NORP> enemies.
 (90) Nor can the victory appear doubtful, if we compare the discipline and exercise of the <NORP>Janizaries</NORP> with the pride of birth, the independence of chivalry, the ignorance of the new levies, the mutinous temper of the veterans, and the vices of intemperance and disorder, which so long contaminated the armies of Europe.
 Invention and use of gunpowder.
 The only hope of salvation for the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire, and the adjacent kingdoms, would have been some more powerful weapon, some discovery in the art of war, that would give them a decisive superiority over their <NORP>Turkish</NORP> foes.
 Such a weapon was in their hands; such a discovery had been made in the critical moment of their fate.
 The chemists of <GPE>China</GPE> or <LOC>Europe</LOC> had found, by casual or elaborate experiments, that a mixture of saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal, produces, with a spark of fire, a tremendous explosion.
 It was soon observed, that if the expansive force were compressed in a strong tube, a ball of stone or iron might be expelled with irresistible and destructive velocity.
 The precise aera of the invention and application of gunpowder (91) is involved in doubtful traditions and equivocal language; yet we may clearly discern, that it was known before the middle of the fourteenth century; and that before the end of the same, the use of artillery in battles and sieges, by sea and land, was familiar to the states of Germany, Italy, Spain, France, and England.
 (92) The priority of nations is of small account; none could derive any exclusive benefit from their previous or superior knowledge; and in the common improvement, they stood on the same level of relative power and military science.
 Nor was it possible to circumscribe the secret within the pale of the church; it was disclosed to the <NORP>Turks</NORP> by the treachery of apostates and the selfish policy of rivals; and the sultans had sense to adopt, and wealth to reward, the talents of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> engineer.
 The Genoese, who transported <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> into Europe, must be accused as his preceptors; and it was probably by their hands that his cannon was cast and directed at the siege of Constantinople.
 (93) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attempt was indeed unsuccessful; but in the general warfare of the age, the advantage was on their side, who were most commonly the assailants: for a while the proportion of the attack and defence was suspended; and this thundering artillery was pointed against the walls and towers which had been erected only to resist the less potent engines of antiquity.
 By the Venetians, the use of gunpowder was communicated without reproach to the sultans of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Persia, their allies against the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> power; the secret was soon propagated to the extremities of Asia; and the advantage of the <NORP>European</NORP> was confined to his easy victories over the savages of the new world.
 If we contrast the rapid progress of this mischievous discovery with the slow and laborious advances of reason, science, and the arts of peace, a philosopher, according to his temper, will laugh or weep at the folly of mankind.
