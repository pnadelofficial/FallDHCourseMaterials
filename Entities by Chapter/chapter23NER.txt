The religion of Julian.
—Universal Toleration.
—He attempts to restore and reform the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> Worship—to rebuild the temple of Jerusalem.
—His artful persecution of the Christians.
—Mutual zeal and injusticeReligion of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> The character of <PERSON>Apostate</PERSON> has injured the reputation of Julian; and the enthusiasm which clouded his virtues has exaggerated the real and apparent magnitude of his faults.
 Our partial ignorance may represent him as a philosophic monarch, who studied to protect, with an equal hand, the religious factions of the empire, and to allay the theological fever which had inflamed the minds of the people from the edicts of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> to the exile of Athanasius.
 A more accurate view of the character and conduct of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> will remove this favourable prepossession for a prince who did not escape the general contagion of the times.
 We enjoy the singular advantage of comparing the pictures which have been delineated by his fondest admirers and his implacable enemies.
 The actions of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> are faithfully related by a judicious and candid historian, the impartial spectator of his life and death.
 The unanimous evidence of his contemporaries is confirmed by the public and private declarations of the emperor himself; and his various writings express the uniform tenor of his religious sentiments, which policy would have prompted him to dissemble rather than to affect.
 A devout and sincere attachment for the gods of <GPE>Athens</GPE> and <GPE>Rome</GPE> constituted the ruling passion of Julian; (1) the powers of an enlightened understanding were betrayed and corrupted by the influence of superstitious prejudice; and the phantoms which existed only in the mind of the emperor had a real and pernicious effect on the government of the empire.
 The vehement zeal of the Christians, who despised the worship, and overturned the altars, of those fabulous deities, engaged their votary in a state of irreconcilable hostility with a very numerous party of his subjects; and he was sometimes tempted, by the desire of victory or the shame of a repulse, to violate the laws of prudence, and even of justice.
 The triumph of the party which he deserted and opposed has fixed a stain of infamy on the name of Julian; and the unsuccessful apostate has been overwhelmed with a torrent of pious invectives, of which the signal was given by the sonorous trumpet (2) of Gregory Nazianzen.
(3) The interesting nature of the events which were crowded into the short reign of this active emperor deserves a just and circumstantial narrative.
 His motive, his counsels, and his actions, as far as they are connected with the history of religion, will be the subject of the present chapter.
 His education and apostacy The cause of his strange and fatal apostasy may be derived from the early period of his life when he was left an orphan in the hands of the murderers of his family.
 The names of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and of Constantius, the ideas of slavery and of religion, were soon associated in a youthful imagination, which was susceptible of the most lively impressions.
 The care of his infancy was intrusted to Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia,(4) who was related to him on the side of his mother; and till <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> reached the twentieth year of his age, he received from his <NORP>Christian</NORP> preceptors the education not of a hero but of a saint.
 The emperor, less jealous of a heavenly than of an earthly crown, contented himself with the imperfect character of a catechumen, while he bestowed the advantages of baptism(5) on the nephews of Constantine.
(6) They were even admitted to the inferior offices of the ecclesiastical order; and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> publicly read the Holy Scriptures in the church of Nicomedia.
 The study of religion, which they assiduously cultivated, appeared to produce the fairest fruits of faith and devotion.
(7) They prayed, they fasted, they distributed alms to the poor, gifts to the clergy, and oblations to the tombs of the martyrs; and the splendid monument of St.
 Mamas, at Caesarea, was erected, or at least was undertaken, by the joint labour of <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> and Julian.
 (8) They respectfully conversed with the bishops who were eminent for superior sanctity, and solicited the benediction of the monks and hermits who had introduced into <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> the voluntary hardships of the ascetic life.
(9) As the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes advanced towards the years of manhood, they discovered, in their religious sentiments, the difference of their characters.
 The dull and obstinate understanding of <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> embraced, with implicit zeal, the doctrines of Christianity, which never influenced his conduct, or moderated his passions.
 The mild disposition of the younger brother was less repugnant to the precepts of the Gospel; and his active curiosity might have been gratified by a theological system which explains the mysterious essence of the Deity, and opens the boundless prospect of invisible and future worlds.
 But the independent spirit of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> refused to yield the passive and unresisting obedience which was required, in the name of religion, by the haughty ministers of the church.
 Their speculative opinions were imposed as positive laws, and guarded by the terrors of eternal punishments; but while they prescribed the rigid formulary of the thoughts, the words, and the actions of the young prince; whilst they silenced his objections, and severely checked the freedom of his inquiries, they secretly provoked his impatient genius to disclaim the authority of his ecclesiastical guides.
 He was educated in the lesser Asia, amidst the scandals of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> controversy.
(10) The fierce contests of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> bishops, the incessant alterations of their creeds, and the profane motives which appeared to actuate their conduct, insensibly strengthened the prejudice of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> that they neither understood nor believed the religion for which they so fiercely contended.
 Instead of listening to the proofs of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> with that favourable attention which adds weight to the most respectable evidence, he heard with suspicion, and disputed with obstinacy and acuteness, the doctrines for which he already entertained an invincible aversion.
 Whenever the young princes were directed to compose declamations on the subject of the prevailing controversies, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> always declared himself the advocate of Paganism, under the specious excuse that, in the defence of the weaker cause, his learning and ingenuity might be more advantageously exercised and displayed.
 He embraces the mythology of paganism As soon as <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> was invested with the honours of the purple, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was permitted to breathe the air of freedom, of literature, and of Paganism.
(11) The crowd of sophists who were attracted by the taste and liberality of their royal pupil, had formed a strict alliance between the learning and the religion of Greece; and the poems of Homer, instead of being admired as the original productions of human genius, were seriously ascribed to the heavenly inspiration of <PRODUCT>Apollo</PRODUCT> and the muses.
 The deities of Olympus, as they are painted by the immortal bard, imprint themselves on the minds which are the least addicted to superstitious credulity.
 Our familiar knowledge of their names and characters, their forms and attributes, 'seems' to bestow on those airy beings a real and substantial existence; and the pleasing enchantment produces an imperfect and momentary assent of the imagination to those fables which are the most repugnant to our reason and experience.
 In the age of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> every circumstance contributed to prolong and fortify the illusion—the magnificent temples of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; the works of those artists who had expressed, in painting or in sculpture, the divine conceptions of the poet; the pomp of festivals and sacrifices; the successful arts of divination; the popular traditions of oracles and prodigies; and the ancient practice of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand years.
 The weakness of polytheism was, in some measure, excused by the moderation of its claims; and the devotion of the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> was not incompatible with the most licentious scepticism.
(12) Instead of an indivisible and regular system, which occupies the whole extent of the believing mind, the mythology of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was composed of a thousand loose and flexible parts, and the servant of the gods was at liberty to define the degree and measure of his religious faith.
 The creed which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> adopted for his own use was of the largest dimensions; and, by a strange contradiction, he disdained the salutary yoke of the Gospel, whilst he made a voluntary offering of his reason on the altars of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> and Apollo.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the orations of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> is consecrated to the honour of Cybele, the mother of the gods, who required from her effeminate priests the bloody sacrifice so rashly performed by the madness of the <NORP>Phrygian</NORP> boy.
 The pious emperor condescends to relate, without a blush and without a smile, the voyage of the goddess from the shores of <PERSON>Pergamus</PERSON> to the mouth of the Tiber; and the stupendous miracle which convinced the senate and people of <GPE>Rome</GPE> that the lump of clay which their ambassadors had transported over the seas was endowed with life, and sentiment, and divine power.
(13) For the truth of this prodigy he appeals to the public monuments of the city; and censures, with some acrimony, the sickly and affected taste of those men who impertinently derided the sacred traditions of their ancestors.
(14) The allegories But the devout philosopher, who sincerely embraced, and warmly encouraged, the superstition of the people, reserved for himself the privilege of a liberal interpretation, and silently withdrew from the foot of the altars into the sanctuary of the temple.
 The extravagance of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> mythology proclaimed, with a clear and audible voice, that the pious inquirer, instead of being scandalised or satisfied with the literal sense, should diligently explore the occult wisdom, which had been disguised, by the prudence of antiquity, under the mask of folly and of fable.
(15) The philosophers of the <NORP>Platonic</NORP> school,(16) Plotinus, Porphyry, and the divine Iamblichus, were admired as the most skilful masters of this allegorical science, which laboured to soften and harmonise the deformed features of Paganism.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> himself, who was directed in the mysterious pursuit by Aedesius, the venerable successor of Iamblichus, aspired to the possession of a treasure which he esteemed, if we may credit his solemn asseverations, far above the empire of the world.
(17) It was indeed a treasure which derived its value only from opinion; and every artist who flattered himself that he had extracted the precious ore from the surrounding dross claimed an equal right of stamping the name and figure the most agreeable to his peculiar fancy.
 The fable of <PERSON>Atys</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cybele</PERSON> had been already explained by Porphyry; but his labours served only to animate the pious industry of Julian, who invented and published his own allegory of that ancient and mystic tale.
 This freedom of interpretation, which might gratify the pride of the Platonists, exposed the vanity of their art.
 Without a tedious detail the modern reader could not form a just idea of the strange allusions, the forced etymologies, the solemn trifling, and the impenetrable obscurity of these sages, who professed to reveal the system of the universe.
 As the traditions of <NORP>Pagan</NORP> mythology were variously related, the sacred interpreters were at liberty to select the most convenient circumstances; and as they translated an arbitrary cipher, they could extract from any fable any sense which was adapted to their favourite system of religion and philosophy.
 The lascivious form of a naked <LOC>Venus</LOC> was tortured into the discovery of some moral precept, or some physical truth; and the castration of <PERSON>Atys</PERSON> explained the revolution of the sun between the tropics, or the separation of the human soul from vice and error.
(18) Theological system of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> The theological system of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> appears to have contained the sublime and important principles of natural religion.
 But as the faith which is not founded on revelation must remain destitute of any firm assurance, the disciple of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> imprudently relapsed into the habits of vulgar superstition; and the popular and philosophic notion of the Deity seems to have been confounded in the practice, the writings, and even in the mind of Julian.
 (19) The pious emperor acknowledged and adored the Eternal Cause of the universe, to whom he ascribed all the perfections of an infinite nature, invisible to the eyes and inaccessible to the understanding of feeble mortals.
 The Supreme God had created, or rather, in the <NORP>Platonic</NORP> language, had generated, the gradual succession of dependent spirits, of gods, of daemons, of heroes, and of men; and every being which derived its existence immediately from the First Cause received the inherent gift of immortality.
 That so precious an advantage might not be lavished upon unworthy objects, the Creator had intrusted to the skill and power of the inferior gods the office of forming the human body, and of arranging the beautiful harmony of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms.
 To the conduct of these divine ministers he delegated the temporal government of this lower world; but their imperfect administration is not exempt from discord or error.
 The earth and its inhabitants are divided among them, and the characters of <LOC>Mars</LOC> or Minerva, of <LOC>Mercury</LOC> or Venus, may be distinctly traced in the laws and manners of their peculiar votaries.
 As long as our immortal souls are confined in a mortal prison, it is our interest, as well as our duty, to solicit the favour, and to deprecate the wrath, of the powers of heaven; whose pride is gratified by the devotion of mankind, and whose grosser parts may be supposed to derive some nourishment from the fumes of sacrifice.
 (20) The inferior gods might sometimes condescend to animate the statues, and to inhabit the temples, which were dedicated to their honour.
 They might occasionally visit the earth, but the heavens were the proper throne and symbol of their glory.
 The invariable order of the sun, moon, and stars was hastily admitted by <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> as a proof of their eternal duration; and their eternity was a sufficient evidence that they were the workmanship, not of an inferior deity, but of the Omnipotent King.
 In the system of the <NORP>Platonists</NORP> the visible was a type of the invisible world.
 The celestial bodies, as they were informed by a divine spirit, might be considered as the objects the most worthy of religious worship.
 The SUN, whose genial influence pervades and sustains the universe, justly claimed the adoration of mankind, as the bright representative of the LOGOS, the lively, the rational, the beneficent image of the intellectual Father.
 (21) Fanaticism of the philosophers In every age the absence of genuine inspiration is supplied by the strong illusions of enthusiasm and the mimic arts of imposture.
 If, in the time of Julian, these arts had been practised only by the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> priests, for the support of an expiring cause, some indulgence might perhaps be allowed to the interest and habits of the sacerdotal character.
 But it may appear a subject of surprise and scandal that the philosophers themselves should have contributed to abuse the superstitious credulity of mankind,(22) and that the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> mysteries should have been supported by the magic or theurgy of the modern Platonists.
 They arrogantly pretended to control the order of nature, to explore the secrets of futurity, to command the service of the inferior daemons, to enjoy the view and conversation of the superior gods, and, by disengaging the soul from her material bands, to reunite that immortal particle with the Infinite and Divine Spirit.
 Initiation and fanaticism of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> The devout and fearless curiosity of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> tempted the philosophers with the hopes of an easy conquest, which, from the situation of their young proselyte, might be productive of the most important consequences.
 (23) <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> imbibed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rudiments of the <NORP>Platonic</NORP> doctrines from the mouth of Aedesius, who had fixed at <PERSON>Pergamus</PERSON> his wandering and persecuted school.
 But as the declining strength of that venerable sage was unequal to the ardour, the diligence, the rapid conception of his pupil, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of his most learned disciples, <PERSON>Chrysanthes</PERSON> and Eusebius, supplied, at his own desire, the place of their aged master.
 These philosophers seem to have prepared and distributed their respective parts; and they artfully contrived, by dark hints and affected disputes, to excite the impatient hopes of the aspirant till they delivered him into the hands of their associate, Maximus, the boldest and most skilful master of the <NORP>Theurgic</NORP> science.
 By his hands <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was secretly initiated at Ephesus, in the twentieth year of his age.
 His residence at <GPE>Athens</GPE> confirmed this unnatural alliance of philosophy and superstition.
 He obtained the privilege of a solemn initiation into the mysteries of Eleusis, which, amidst the general decay of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> worship, still retained some vestiges of their primeval sanctity; and such was the zeal of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> that he afterwards invited the <NORP>Eleusinian</NORP> pontiff to the court of Gaul, for the sole purpose of consummating, by mystic rites and sacrifices, the great work of his sanctification.
 As these ceremonies were performed in the depth of caverns and in the silence of the night, and as the inviolable secret of the mysteries was preserved by the discretion of the initiated, I shall not presume to describe the horrid sounds and fiery apparitions which were presented to the senses or the imagination of the credulous aspirant,(24) till the visions of comfort and knowledge broke upon him in a blaze of celestial light.
(25) In the caverns of <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> and <GPE>Eleusis</GPE> the mind of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was penetrated with sincere, deep, and unalterable enthusiasm; though he might sometimes exhibit the vicissitudes of pious fraud and hypocrisy which may be observed, or at least suspected, in the characters of the most conscientious fanatics.
 From that moment he consecrated his life to the service of the gods; and while the occupations of war, of government, and of study seemed to claim the whole measure of his time, a stated portion of the hours of the night was invariably reserved for the exercise of private devotion.
 The temperance which adorned the severe manners of the soldier and the philosopher was connected with some strict and frivolous rules of religious abstinence; and it was in honour of Pan or Mercury, of Hecate or Isis, that Julian, on particular days, denied himself the use of some particular food, which might have been offensive to his tutelar deities.
 By these voluntary fasts he prepared his senses and his understanding for the frequent and familiar visits with which he was honoured by the celestial powers.
 Notwithstanding the modest silence of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> himself, we may learn from his faithful friend, the orator Libanius, that he lived in a perpetual intercourse with the gods and goddesses; that they descended upon earth to enjoy the conversation of their favourite hero; that they gently interrupted his slumbers by touching his hand or his hair; that they warned him of every impending danger, and conducted him, by their infallible wisdom, in every action of his life; and that he had acquired such an intimate knowledge of his heavenly guests, as readily to distinguish the voice of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> from that of Minerva, and the form of <PRODUCT>Apollo</PRODUCT> from the figure of Hercules.
 (26) These sleeping or waking visions, the ordinary effects of abstinence and fanaticism, would almost degrade the emperor to the level of an <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> monk.
 But the useless lives of <PERSON>Antony</PERSON> or <PERSON>Pachomius</PERSON> were consumed in these vain occupations.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> could break from the dream of superstition to arm himself for battle; and after vanquishing in the field the enemies of Rome, he calmly retired into his tent, to dictate the wise and salutary laws of an empire, or to indulge his genius in the elegant pursuits of literature and philosophy.
 His religious dissimulation.
 The important secret of the apostasy of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was intrusted to the fidelity of the initiated, with whom he was united by the sacred ties of friendship and religion.
(27) The pleasing rumour was cautiously circulated among the adherents of the ancient worship; and his future greatness became the object of the hopes, the prayers, and the predictions of the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> in every province of the empire.
 From the zeal and virtues of their royal proselyte they fondly expected the cure of every evil and the restoration of every blessing; and instead of disapproving of the ardour of their pious wishes, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> ingenuously confessed that he was ambitious to attain a situation in which he might be useful to his country and to his religion.
 But this religion was viewed with an hostile eye by the successor of Constantine, whose capricious passions alternately saved and threatened the life of Julian.
 The arts of magic and divination were strictly prohibited under a despotic government which condescended to fear them; and if the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> were reluctantly indulged in the exercise of their superstition, the rank of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> would have excepted him from the general toleration.
 The apostate soon became the presumptive heir of the monarchy, and his death could alone have appeased the just apprehensions of the Christians.
 (28) But the young prince, who aspired to the glory of a hero rather than of a martyr, consulted his safety by dissembling his religion; and the easy temper of polytheism permitted him to join in the public worship of a sect which he inwardly despised.
 <PERSON>Libanius</PERSON> has considered the hypocrisy of his friend as a subject, not of censure, but of praise.
 The dissimulation of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> lasted above ten years, from his secret initiation at <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> to the beginning of the civil war; when he declared himself at once the implacable enemy of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and of Constantius.
 This state of constraint might contribute to strengthen his devotion; and as soon as he had satisfied the obligation of assisting, on solemn festivals, at the assemblies of the Christians, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> returned, with the impatience of a lover, to burn his free and voluntary incense on the domestic chapels of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> and Mercury.
 But as every act of dissimulation must be painful to an ingenuous spirit, the profession of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> increased the aversion of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> for a religion which oppressed the freedom of his mind, and compelled him to hold a conduct repugnant to the noblest attributes of human nature — sincerity and courage.
 He writes against Christianity.
 The inclination of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> might prefer the gods of <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> and of the <NORP>Scipios</NORP> to the new faith which his uncle had established in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, and in which he himself had been sanctified by the sacrament of baptism.
 But, as a philosopher, it was incumbent on him to justify his dissent from Christianity, which was supported by the number of its converts, by the chain of prophecy, the splendour of miracles, and the weight of evidence.
 The elaborate work(30) which he composed amidst the preparations of the Persian war contained the substance of those arguments which he had long revolved in his mind.
 Some fragments have been transcribed and preserved by his adversary, the vehement <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> of Alexandria;(31) and they exhibit a very singular mixture of wit and learning, of sophistry and fanaticism.
 The elegance of the style and the rank of the author recommended his writings to the public attention;(32) and in the impious list of the enemies of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> the celebrated name of <PERSON>Porphyry</PERSON> was effaced by the superior merit or reputation of Julian.
 The minds of the faithful were either seduced, or scandalised, or alarmed; and the Pagans, who sometimes presumed to engage in the unequal dispute, derived, from the popular work of their <NORP>Imperial</NORP> missionary, an inexhaustible supply of fallacious objections.
 But in the assiduous prosecution of these theological studies the emperor of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> imbibed the illiberal prejudices and passions of a polemic divine.
 He contracted an irrevocable obligation to maintain and propagate his religious opinions; and whilst he secretly applauded the strength and dexterity with which he wielded the weapons of controversy, he was tempted to distrust the sincerity, or to despise the understandings, of his antagonists, who could obstinately resist the force of reason and eloquence.
 Universal toleration The Christians, who beheld with horror and indignation the apostasy of Julian, had much more to fear from his power than from his arguments.
 The Pagans, who were conscious of his fervent zeal, expected, perhaps with impatience, that the flames of persecution should be immediately kindled against the enemies of the gods; and that the ingenious malice of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> would invent some cruel refinements of death and torture which had been unknown to the rude and inexperienced fury of his predecessors.
 But the hopes, as well as the fears, of the religious factions were apparently disappointed by the prudent humanity of a prince(33) who was careful of his own fame, of the public peace, and of the rights of mankind.
 Instructed by history and reflection, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was persuaded that, if the diseases of the body may sometimes be cured by salutary violence, neither steel nor fire can eradicate the erroneous opinions of the mind.
 The reluctant victim may be dragged to the foot of he altar; but the heart still abhors and disclaims the sacrilegious act of the hand.
 Religious obstinacy is hardened and exasperated by oppression; and, as soon as the persecution subsides, those who have yielded are restored as penitents, and those who have resisted are honoured as saints and martys.
 If <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> adopted the unsuccessful cruelty of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and his colleagues, he was sensible that he should stain his memory with the name of tyrant, and add new glories to the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church, which had derived strength and increase from the severity of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> magistrates.
 Actuated by these motives, and apprehensive of disturbing the repose of an unsettled reign, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> surprised the world by an edict which was not unworthy of a statesman or a philosopher.
 He extended to all he inhabitants of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world the benefits of a free and equal toleration; and the only hardship which he inflicted on the <NORP>Christians</NORP> was to deprive them of the power of tormenting their fellow-subjects, whom they stigmatised with the odious titles of idolaters and heretics.
 The <NORP>Pagans</NORP> received a gracious permission, or rather an express order, to open ALL their temples;(34) and they were at once delivered from the oppressive laws and arbitrary vexations which they had sustained under the reign of <PERSON>Constanine</PERSON> and of his sons.
 At the same time, the bishops and clergy who had been banished by the <NORP>Arian</NORP> monarch were recalled from exile, and restored to their respective churches; the Donatists, the Novatians, the Macedonians, the Punomians, and those who, with a more prosperous fortune, adhered to the doctrine of the council of Nice.
 Julian, who understood and derided their theological disputes, invited to the palace the leaders of the hostile sects, that he might enjoy the agreeable spectacle of their furious encounters.
 The clamour of controversy sometimes provoked the emperor to exclaim, "Hear me! the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> have heard me, and the Alemanni"; but he soon discovered that he was now engaged with more obstinate and implacable enemies; and though he exerted the powers of oratory to persuade them to live in concord, or at least in peace, he was perfectly satisfied, before he dismissed them from his presence, that he had nothing to dread from the union of the Christians.
 The impartial <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> has ascribed this affected clemency to the desire of fomenting the intestine divisions of the church; and the insidious design of undermining the foundations of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was inseparably connected with the zeal which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> professed to restore the ancient religion of the empire.
(35) Zeal and devotion of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> in the restoration of paganism.
 As soon as he ascended the throne, he assumed, according to the custom of his predecessors, the character of supreme pontiff; not only as the most honourable title of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> greatness, but as a sacred and important office, the duties of which he was resolved to execute with pious diligence.
 As the business of the state prevented the emperor from joining every day in the public devotion of his subjects, he dedicated a domestic chapel to his tutelar deity the Sun; his gardens were filled with statues and altars of the gods; and each apartment of the palace displayed the appearance of a magnificent temple.
 Every morning he saluted the parent of light with a sacrifice; the blood of another victim was shed at the moment when the <LOC>Sun</LOC> sunk below the horizon; and the Moon, the Stars, and the <NORP>Genii</NORP> of the night received their respective and seasonable honours from the indefatigable devotion of Julian.
 On solemn festivals he regularly visited the temple of the god or goddess to whom the day was peculiarly consecrated, and endeavoured to excite the religion of the magistrates and people by the example of his own zeal.
 Instead of maintaining the lofty state of a monarch, distinguished by the splendour of his purple, and encompassed by the golden shields of his guards, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> solicited, with respectful eagerness, the meanest offices which contributed to the worship of the gods.
 Amidst the sacred but licentious crowd of priests, of inferior ministers, and of female dancers, who were dedicated to the service of the temple, it was the business of the emperor to bring the wood, to blow the fire, to handle the knife, to slaughter the victim, and, thrusting his bloody hands into the bowels of the expiring animal, to draw forth the heart or liver, and to read, with the consummate skill of an haruspex, the imaginary signs of future events.
 The wisest of the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> censured this extravagant superstition, which affected to despise the restraints of prudence and decency.
 Under the reign of a prince who practised the rigid maxims of economy, the expense of religious worship consumed a very large portion of the revenue; a constant supply of the scarcest and most beautiful birds was transported from distant climates, to bleed on the altars of the gods, an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> oxen were frequently sacrificed by <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> and the same day; and it soon became a popular jest, that, if he should return with conquest from the Persian war, the breed of horned cattle must infallibly be extinguished.
 Yet this expense may appear inconsiderable, when it is compared with the splendid presents which were offered, either by the hand or by the order of the emperor, to all the celebrated places of devotion in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; and with the sums allotted to repair and decorate the ancient temples, which had suffered the silent decay of time, or the recent injuries of <NORP>Christian</NORP> rapine.
 Encouraged by the example, the exhortations, the liberality of their pious sovereign, the cities and families resumed the practice of their neglected ceremonies.
 Reformation of <NORP>Paganism</NORP> But the genius and power of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were unequal to the enterprise of restoring a religion which was destitute of theological principles, of moral precepts, and of ecclesiastical discipline; which rapidly hastened to decay and dissolution, and was not susceptible of any solid or consistent reformation.
 The jurisdiction of the supreme pontiff, more especially after that office had been united with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity, comprehended the whole extent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> named for his vicars, in the several provinces, the priests and philosophers, whom he esteemed the best qualified to cooperate in the execution of his great design; and his pastoral letters,(37) if we may use that name, still represent a very curious sketch of his wishes and intentions.
 He directs that in every city the sacerdotal order should be composed, without any distinction of birth or fortune, of those persons who were the most conspicuous for their love of the gods and of men.
 The <NORP>Imperial</NORP> pontiff inculcates, in the most persuasive language, the duties of benevolence and hospitality; exhorts his inferior clergy to recommend the universal practice of those virtues; promises to assist their indigence from the public treasury; and declares his resolution of establishing hospitals in every city, where the poor should be received without any invidious distinction of country or of religion.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> beheld with envy the wise and humane regulations of the church; and he very frankly confessed his intention to deprive the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of the applause, as well as advantage, which they had acquired by the exclusive practice of charity and beneficence.
(39) The same spirit of imitation might dispose the emperor to adopt several ecclesiastical institutions, the use and importance of which were approved by the success of his enemies.
 But if these imaginary plans of reformation had been realised, the forced and imperfect copy would have been less beneficial to <NORP>Paganism</NORP> than honourable to Christianity.
(40) The Gentiles, who peaceably followed the customs of their ancestors, were rather surprised than pleased with the introduction of foreign manners; and, in the short period of his reign, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had frequent occasions to complain of the want of fervour of his own party.
(41) The Philosophers The enthusiasm of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> prompted him to embrace the friends of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> as his personal friends and brethren; and though he partially overlooked the merit of <NORP>Christian</NORP> constancy, he admired and rewarded the noble perseverance those <NORP>Gentiles</NORP> who had preferred the favour of the gods to that of the emperor.
(42) If they cultivated the literature as well as the religion of the Greeks, they acquired an additional claim to the friendship of Julian, who ranked the Muses in the number of his tutelar deities.
 In the religion which he had adopted, piety and learning were almost synonymous;(43) and a crowd of poets, of rhetoricians, and of philosophers, hastened to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court to occupy the vacant places of the bishops who had seduced the credulity of Constantius.
 His successor esteemed the ties of common initiation as far more sacred than those of consanguinity; he chose his favourites among the sages who were deeply skilled in the occult sciences of magic and divination, and every impostor who pretended to reveal the secrets of futurity was assured of enjoying the present hour in honour and affluence.
(44) Among the philosophers, <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> obtained the most eminent rank in the friendship of his royal disciple, who communicated, with unreserved confidence, his actions, his sentiments, and his religious designs, during the anxious suspense of the civil war.
 (45) As soon as <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had taken possession of the palace of Constantinople, he despatched an honourable and pressing invitation to Maximus, who then resided at <PERSON>Sardes</PERSON> in Lydia, with Chrysanthius, the associate of his art and studies.
 The prudent and superstitious <PERSON>Chrysanthius</PERSON> refused to undertake a journey which showed itself, according to the rules of divination, with the most threatening and malignant aspect; but his companion, whose fanaticism was of a bolder cast, persisted in his interrogations till he had extorted from the gods a seeming consent to his own wishes and those of the emperor.
 The journey of <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> through the cities of <LOC>Asia</LOC> displayed the triumph of philosophic vanity, and the magistrates vied with each other in the honourable reception which they prepared for the friend of their sovereign.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was pronouncing an oration before the senate when he was informed of the arrival of Maximus.
 The emperor immediately interrupted his discourse, advanced to meet him, and, after a tender embrace, conducted him by the hand into the midst of the assembly, where he publicly acknowledged the benefits which he had derived from the instructions of the philosopher.
 Maximus,(46) who soon acquired the confidence, and influenced the councils, of Julian, was insensibly corrupted by the temptations of a court.
 His dress became more splendid, his demeanour more lofty, and he was exposed, under a succeeding reign, to a disgraceful inquiry into the means by which the disciple of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> had accumulated, in the short duration of his favour, a very scandalous proportion of wealth.
 Of the other philosophers and sophists who were invited to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> residence by the choice of Julian, or by the success of Maximus, few were able to preserve their innocence or their reputation.
 (47) The liberal gifts of money, lands, and houses were insufficient to satiate their rapacious avarice, and the indignation of the people was justly excited by the remembrance of their abject poverty and disinterested professions.
 The penetration of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> could not always be deceived, but he was unwilling to despise the characters of those men whose talents deserved his esteem; he desired to escape the double reproach of imprudence and inconstancy, and he was apprehensive of degrading, in the eyes of the profane, the honour of letters and of religion.
(48) Conversions The favour of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was almost equally divided between the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> who had firmly adhered to the worship of their ancestors, and the <NORP>Christians</NORP> who prudently embraced the religion of their sovereign.
 The acquisition of new proselytes(49) gratified the ruling passions of his soul, superstition and vanity; and he was heard to declare, with the enthusiasm of a missionary, that if he could render each individual richer than Midas, and every city greater than Babylon, he should not esteem himself the benefactor of mankind unless, at the same time, he could reclaim his subjects from their impious revolt against the immortal gods.
(50) A prince, who had studied human nature, and who possessed the treasures of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, could adapt his arguments, his promises, and his rewards to every order of Christians;(51) and the merit of a seasonable conversion was allowed to supply the defects of a candidate, or even to expiate the guilt of a criminal.
 As the army is the most forcible engine of absolute power, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> applied himself, with peculiar diligence, to corrupt the religion of his troops, without whose hearty concurrence every measure must be dangerous and unsuccessful, and the natural temper of soldiers made this conquest as easy as it was important.
 The legions of <GPE>Gaul</GPE> devoted themselves to the faith, as well as to the fortunes, of their victorious leader; and even before the death of Constantius, he had the satisfaction of announcing to his friends that they assisted, with fervent devotion and voracious appetite, at the sacrifices, which were repeatedly offered in his camp, of whole hecatombs of fat oxen.
(52) The armies of the East, which had been trained under the standard of the cross and of Constantius, required a more artful and expensive mode of persuasion.
 On the <DATE>days</DATE> of solemn and public festivals the emperor received the homage, and rewarded the merit, of the troops.
 His throne of state was encircled with the military ensigns of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the republic; the holy name of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was erased from the Labarum; and the symbols of war, of majesty, and of <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition were so dexterously blended that the faithful subject incurred the guilt of idolatry when he respectfully saluted the person or image of his sovereign.
 The soldiers passed successively in review, and each of them, before he received from the hand of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> a liberal donative, proportioned to his rank and services, was required to cast a few grains of incense into the flame which burnt upon the altar.
 Some <NORP>Christian</NORP> confessors might resist, and others might repent; but the far greater number, allured by the prospect of gold and awed by the presence of the emperor, contracted the criminal engagement, and their future perseverance in the worship of the gods was enforced by every consideration of duty and of interest.
 By the frequent repetition of these arts, and at the expense of sums which would have purchased the service of <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> the nations of Scythia, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> gradually acquired for his troops the imaginary protection of the gods, and for himself the firm and effectual support of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions.
(53) It is indeed more than probable that the restoration and encouragement of <NORP>Paganism</NORP> revealed a multitude of pretended Christians, who, from motives of temporal advantage, had acquiesced in the religion of the former reign, and who afterwards returned, with the same flexibility of conscience, to the faith which was professed by the successors of Julian.
 The <NORP>Jews</NORP> While the devout monarch incessantly laboured to restore and propagate the religion of his ancestors, he embraced the extraordinary design of rebuilding the temple of Jerusalem.
 In a public epistle (54) to the nation or community of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> dispersed through the provinces, he pities their misfortunes, condemns their oppressors, praises their constancy, declares himself their gracious protector, and expresses a pious hope that, after his return from the Persian war, he may be permitted to pay his grateful vows to the Almighty in his holy city of Jerusalem.
 The blind superstition and abject slavery of those unfortunate exiles must excite the contempt of a philosophic emperor, but they deserved the friendship of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> by their implacable hatred of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> name.
 The barren synagogue abhorred and envied the fecundity of the rebellious church; the power of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> was not equal to their malice, but their gravest rabbis approved the private murder of an apostate,(55) and their seditious clamours had often awakened the indolence of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> magistrates.
 Under the reign of Constantine, the <NORP>Jews</NORP> became the subjects of their revolted children, nor was it long before they experienced the bitterness of domestic tyranny.
 The civil immunities which had been granted or confirmed by <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> were gradually repealed by the <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes; and a rash tumult, excited by the <NORP>Jews</NORP> of Palestine,(56) seemed to justify the lucrative modes of oppression which were invented by the bishops and eunuchs of the court of Constantius.
 The <NORP>Jewish</NORP> patriarch, who was still permitted to exercise a precarious jurisdiction, held his residence at Tiberias,(57) and the neighbouring cities of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> were filled with the remains of a people who fondly adhered to the promised land.
 But the edict of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> was renewed and enforced, and they viewed from afar the walls the holy city, which were profaned in their eyes by the triumph of the cross and the devotion the Christians.
 (58) <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> In the midst of a rocky and barren country the walls of Jerusalem(59) enclosed the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> mountains of <PERSON>Sion</PERSON> and <GPE>Acra</GPE> within an oval figure of about three English miles.
(60) Towards the south, the upper town and the fortress of <PERSON>David</PERSON> were erected on the lofty ascent of Mount Sion; on the north side, the buildings of the lower town covered the spacious summit of Mount Acra; and a part of the hill, distinguished by the name Of Moriah, and levelled by human industry, was crowned with the stately temple of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> nation.
 After the final destruction of the temple by the arms of <PERSON>Titus</PERSON> and Hadrian, a ploughshare was drawn over the consecrated ground, as a sign of perpetual interdiction.
 <PERSON>Sion</PERSON> was deserted, and the vacant space of the lower city was filled with the public and private edifices of the <NORP>Aelian</NORP> colony, which spread themselves over the adjacent hill of Calvary.
 The holy places were polluted with monuments of idolatry, and, either from design or accident, a chapel was dedicated to <LOC>Venus</LOC> on the spot which had been sanctified by the death and resurrection of Christ.
 (61) Almost three <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years after those stupendous events, the profane chapel of <LOC>Venus</LOC> was demolished by the order of Constantine, and the removal of the earth and stones revealed the holy sepulchre to the eyes of mankind.
 A magnificent church was erected on that mystic ground by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperor, and the effects of his pious munificence were extended to every spot which had been consecrated by the footsteps of patriarchs, of prophets, and of the Son of God.
(62) Pilgrimages The passionate desire of contemplating the original monuments of their redemption attracted to <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> a successive crowd of pilgrims from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and the most distant countries of the East:(63) and their piety was authorised by the example of the empress Helena, who appears to have united the credulity of age with the warm feelings of a recent conversion.
 Sages and heroes, who have visited the memorable scenes of ancient wisdom or glory, have confessed the inspiration of the genius of the place;(64) and the <NORP>Christian</NORP> who knelt before the holy sepulchre ascribed his lively faith and his fervent devotion to the more immediate influence of the Divine Spirit.
 The zeal, perhaps the avarice, of the clergy of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> cherished and multiplied these beneficial visits.
 They fixed, by unquestionable tradition, the scene of each memorable event.
 They exhibited the instruments which had been used in the passion of Christ; the nails and the lance that had pierced his hands, his feet, and his side; the crown of thorns that was planted on his head; the pillar at which he was scourged and, above all, they showed the cross on which he suffered, and which was dug out of the earth in the reign of those princes who inserted the symbol of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> in the banners of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions.
(65) Such miracles as seemed necessary to account for its extraordinary preservation and seasonable discovery were gradually propagated without opposition.
 The custody of the true cross, which on Easter Sunday was solemnly exposed to the people, was intrusted to the bishop of Jerusalem; and he alone might gratify the curious devotion of the pilgrims by the gift of small pieces, which they enchased in gold or gems, and carried away in triumph to their respective countries.
 But as this gainful branch of commerce must soon have been annihilated, it was found convenient to suppose that the marvellous wood possessed a secret power of vegetation, and that its substance, though continually diminished, still remained entire and unimpaired.
 (66) It might perhaps have been expected that the influence of the place and the belief of a perpetual miracle should have produced some salutary effects on the morals, as well as on the faith, of the people.
 Yet the most respectable of the ecclesiastical writers have been obliged to confess, not only that the streets of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> were filled with the incessant tumult of business and pleasure,(67) but that every species of vice—adultery, theft, idolatry, poisoning, murder was familiar to the inhabitants of the holy city.
(68) The wealth and pre-eminence of the church of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> excited the ambition of <NORP>Arian</NORP> as well as orthodox candidates and the virtues of Cyril, who since his death has been honoured with the title of Saint, were displayed in the exercise, rather than in the acquisition, of his episcopal dignity.
(69) <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> attempts to rebuild the temple.
 The vain and ambitious mind of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> might aspire to restore the ancient glory of the temple of Jerusalem.
(70) As the <NORP>Christians</NORP> were firmly persuaded that a sentence of everlasting destruction had been pronounced against the whole fabric of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> law, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> sophist would have converted the success of his undertaking into a specious argument against the faith of prophecy and the truth of revelation.
(71) He was displeased with the spiritual worship of the synagogue; but he approved the institutions of Moses, who had not disdained to adopt many of the rites and ceremonies of Egypt.
(72) The local and national deity of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> was sincerely adored by a polytheist who desired only to multiply the number of the gods;(73) and such was the appetite of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> for bloody sacrifice, that his emulation might be excited by the piety of Solomon, who had offered at the feast of the dedication twenty-two thousand oxen and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty thousand sheep.
(74) These considerations might influence his designs; but the prospect of an immediate and important advantage would not suffer the impatient monarch to expect the remote and uncertain event of the Persian war.
 He resolved to erect, without delay, on the commanding eminence of Moriah, a stately temple, which might eclipse the splendour of the church of the Resurrection on the adjacent hill of Calvary; to establish an order of priests, whose interested zeal would detect the arts and resist the ambition of their <NORP>Christian</NORP> rivals; and to invite a numerous colony of Jews, whose stern fanaticism would be always prepared to second, and even to anticipate, the hostile measures of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> government.
 Among the friends of the emperor (if the names of emperor and of friend are not incompatible) the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> place was assigned, by <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> himself, to the virtuous and learned Alypius.
(75) The humanity of <GPE>Alypius</GPE> was tempered by severe justice and manly fortitude; and while he exercised his abilities in the civil administration of Britain, he imitated, in his poetical compositions, the harmony and softness of the odes of Sappho.
 This minister, to whom <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> communicated, without reserve, his most careless levities and his most serious counsels, received an extraordinary commission to restore, in its pristine beauty, the temple of Jerusalem; and the diligence of <GPE>Alypius</GPE> required and obtained the strenuous support of the governor of Palestine.
 At the call of their great deliverer, the <NORP>Jews</NORP> from all the provinces of the empire assembled on the holy mountain of their fathers; and their insolent triumph alarmed and exasperated the <NORP>Christian</NORP> inhabitants of Jerusalem.
 The desire of rebuilding the temple has in every age been the ruling passion of the children of Israel.
 In this propitious moment the men forgot their avarice, and the women their delicacy; spades and pick-axes of silver were provided by the vanity of the rich, and the rubbish was transported in mantles of silk and purple.
 Every purse was opened in liberal contributions, every hand claimed a share in the pious labour; and the commands of a great monarch were executed by the enthusiasm of a whole people.
(76) The enterprise is defeated, Yet, on this occasion, the joint efforts of power and enthusiasm were unsuccessful; and the ground of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> temple, which is now covered by a <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> mosque,(77) still continued to exhibit the same edifying spectacle of ruin and desolation.
 Perhaps the absence and death of the emperor, and the new maxims of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> reign, might explain the interruption of an arduous work, which was attempted only in the last six months of the life of Julian.
 (78) But the <NORP>Christians</NORP> entertained a natural and pious expectation that in this memorable contest the honour of religion would be vindicated by some signal miracle.
 An earthquake, a whirlwind and a fiery eruption, which overturned and scattered the new foundations of the temple are attested, with some variations, by contemporary and respectable evidence.
(79) This public event is described by Ambrose,(80) bishop of Milan, in an epistle to the emperor Theodosius, which must provoke the severe animadversion of the Jews; by the eloquent Chrysostom, (81) who might appeal to the memory of the elder part of his congregation at Antioch; Perhaps by a preternatural event and by Gregory Nazianzen,(82) who published his account of the miracle before the expiration of the same year.
 The last of these writers has boldly declared that this preternatural event was not disputed by the infidels; and his assertion, strange as it may seem, is confirmed by the unexceptionable testimony of <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus.
 (83) The philosophic soldier, who loved the virtues without adopting the prejudices of his master, has recorded, in his judicious and candid history of his own times, the extraordinary obstacles which interrupted the restoration of the temple of Jerusalem.
 Such authority should satisfy a believing, and must astonish an incredulous, mind.
 Yet a philosopher may still require the original evidence of impartial and intelligent spectators.
 At this important crisis any singular accident of nature would assume the appearance, and produce the effects, of a real prodigy.
 This glorious deliverance would be speedily improved and magnified by the pious art of the clergy of Jerusalem, and the active credulity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world; and, at the distance of twenty years, a <NORP>Roman</NORP> historian, careless of theological disputes, might adorn his work with the specious and splendid miracle.
(84) Partiality of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> The restoration of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> temple was secretly connected with the ruin of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> church.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> still continued to maintain the freedom of religious worship, without distinguishing whether this universal toleration proceeded from his justice or his clemency.
 He affected to pity the unhappy Christians, who were mistaken in the most important object of their lives; but his pity was degraded by contempt, his contempt was embittered by hatred; and the sentiments of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were expressed in a style of sarcastic wit, which inflicts a deep and deadly wound whenever it issues from the mouth of a sovereign.
 As he was sensible that the <NORP>Christians</NORP> gloried in the name of their Redeemer, he countenanced, and perhaps enjoined, the use of the less honourable appellation of GALILEANS.
(85) He declared that, by the folly of the Galileans, whom he describes as a sect of fanatics, contemptible to men and odious to the Gods, the empire had been reduced to the brink of destruction; and he insinuates in a public edict that a frantic patient might sometimes be cured by salutary violence.
(86) An ungenerous distinction was admitted into the mind and counsels of Julian, that, according to the difference of their religious sentiments, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> part of his subjects deserved his favour and friendship, while the other was entitled only to the common benefits that his justice could not refuse to an obedient people.
(87) According to a principle pregnant with mischief and oppression, the emperor transferred to the pontiffs of his own religion the management of the liberal allowances from the public revenue which had been granted to the church by the piety of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and his sons.
 The proud system of clerical honours and immunities, which had been constructed with so much art and labour, was levelled to he ground; the hopes of testamentary donations were intercepted by the rigour of the laws; and the priests of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> sect were confounded with the last and most ignominious class of the people.
 Such of these regulations as appeared necessary to check the ambition and avarice of the ecclesiastics were soon afterwards imitated by the wisdom of an orthodox prince.
 The peculiar distinctions which policy has bestowed, or superstition has lavished, on the sacerdotal order, must be confined to those priests who profess the religion of the state.
 But the will of the legislator was not exempt from prejudice and passion; and it was the object of the insidious policy of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> to deprive the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of all the temporal honours and advantages which rendered them respectable in the eyes of the world.
(88) He prohibits the <NORP>Christians</NORP> from teaching schools.
 A just and severe censure has been inflicted on the law which prohibited the <NORP>Christians</NORP> from teaching the arts of grammar and rhetoric.
 (89) The motives alleged by the emperor to justify his partial and oppressive measure might command, during his lifetime, the silence of slaves and the applause of flatterers.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> abuses the ambiguous meaning of a word which might be indifferently applied to the language and the religion of the GREEKS: he contemptuously observes that the men who exalt the merit of implicit faith are unfit to claim or to enjoy the advantages of science; and he vainly contends that, if they refuse to adore the gods of <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> and Demosthenes, they ought to content themselves with expounding <PERSON>Luke</PERSON> and <PERSON>Matthew</PERSON> in the churches of the Galileans.
(90) In all the cities of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world the education of the youth was intrusted to masters of grammar and rhetoric, who were elected by the magistrates, maintained at the public expense, and distinguished by many lucrative and honourable privileges.
 The edict of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> appears to have included the physicians, and professors of all the liberal arts; and the emperor, who reserved to himself the approbation of the candidates, was authorised by the laws to corrupt, or to punish, the religious constancy of the most learned of the Christians.
(91) As soon as the resignation of the more obstinate (92) teachers had established the unrivalled dominion of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> sophists, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> invited the rising generation to resort with freedom to the public schools, in a just confidence that their tender minds would receive the impressions of literature and idolatry.
 If the greatest part of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> youth should be deterred by their own scruples, or by those of their parents, from accepting this dangerous mode of instruction, they must, at the same time, relinquish the benefits of a liberal education.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had reason to expect that, in the space of a few years, the church would relapse into its primeval simplicity, and that the theologians, who possessed an adequate share of the learning and eloquence of the age, would be succeeded by a generation of blind and ignorant fanatics, incapable of defending the truth of their own principles, or of exposing the various follies of Polytheism.
(93) Disgrace and oppression of the Christians.
 It was undoubtedly the wish and the design of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> to deprive the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of the advantages of wealth, of knowledge, and of power; but the injustice of excluding them from all offices of trust and profit seems to have been the result of his general policy, rather than the immediate consequence of any positive law.
 (94) Superior merit might deserve and obtain some extraordinary exceptions; but the greater part of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> officers were gradually removed from their employments in the state, the army, and the provinces.
 The hopes of future candidates were extinguished by the declared partiality of a prince who maliciously reminded them that it was unlawful for a <NORP>Christian</NORP> to use the sword, either of justice or of war, and who studiously guarded the camp and the tribunals with the ensigns of idolatry.
 The powers of government were intrusted to the Pagans, who professed an ardent zeal for the religion of their ancestors; and as the choice of the emperor was often directed by the rules of divination, the favourites whom he preferred as the most agreeable to the gods did not always obtain the approbation of mankind.
 (95) Under the administration of their enemies, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> had much to suffer, and more to apprehend.
 The temper of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was averse to cruelty; and the care of his reputation, which was exposed to the eyes of the universe, restrained the philosophic monarch from violating the laws of justice and toleration which he himself had so recently established.
 But the provincial ministers of his authority were placed in a less conspicuous station.
 In the exercise of arbitrary power, they consulted the wishes, rather than the commands, of their sovereign; and ventured to exercise a secret and vexatious tyranny against the sectaries on whom they were not permitted to confer the honours of martyrdom.
 The emperor, who dissembled as long as possible his knowledge of the injustice that was exercised in his name, expressed his real sense of the conduct of his officers by gentle reproofs and substantial rewards.
(96) They are condemned to restore the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> temples.
 The most effectual instrument of oppression with which they were armed was the law that obliged the <NORP>Christians</NORP> to make full and ample satisfaction for the temples which they had destroyed under the preceding reign.
 The zeal of the triumphant church had not always expected the sanction of the public authority; and the bishops, who were secure of impunity, had often marched at the head of their congregations to attack and demolish the fortresses of the prince of darkness.
 The consecrated lands, which had increased the patrimony of the sovereign or of the clergy, were clearly defined, and easily restored.
 But on these lands, and on the ruins of <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> had frequently erected their own religious edifices: and as it was necessary to remove the church before the temple could be rebuilt, the justice and piety of the emperor were applauded by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> party, while the other deplored and execrated his sacrilegious violence.
(97) After the ground was cleared, the restitution of those stately structures which had been levelled with the dust, and of the precious ornaments which had been converted to <NORP>Christian</NORP> uses, swelled into a very large account of damages and debt.
 The authors of the injury had neither the ability nor the inclination to discharge this accumulated demand: and the impartial wisdom of a legislator would have been displayed in balancing the adverse claims and complaints by an equitable and temperate arbitration.
 But the whole empire, and particularly the East, was thrown into confusion by the rash edicts of Julian; and the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> magistrates, inflamed by zeal and revenge, abused the rigorous privilege of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> law, which substitutes, in the place of his inadequate property, the person of the insolvent debtor.
 Under the preceding reign, Mark, bishop of Arethusa,(98) had laboured in the conversion of his people with arms more effectual than those of persuasion.
 (99) The magistrates required the full value of a temple which had been destroyed by his intolerant zeal; but as they were satisfied of his poverty, they desired only to bend his inflexible spirit to the promise of the slightest compensation.
 They apprehended the aged prelate, they inhumanly scourged him, they tore his beard; and his naked body, anointed with honey, was suspended, in a net, between heaven and earth, and exposed to the stings of insects and the rays of a <NORP>Syrian</NORP> sun.
(100) From this lofty station, <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> still persisted to glory in his crime, and to insult the impotent rage of his persecutors.
 He was at length rescued from their hands, and dismissed to enjoy the honour of his divine triumph.
 The <NORP>Arians</NORP> celebrated the virtue of their pious confessor; the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> ambitiously claimed his alliance; (101) and the Pagans, who might be susceptible of shame or remorse, were deterred from the repetition of such unavailing cruelty.
(102) <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> spared his life: but if the bishop of <PERSON>Arethusa</PERSON> had saved the infancy of Julian,(103) posterity will condemn the ingratitude, instead of praising the clemency, of the emperor.
 The temple and sacred grove of <PERSON>Daphne</PERSON> At the distance of five miles from Antioch, the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> kings of <GPE>Syria</GPE> had consecrated to <PRODUCT>Apollo</PRODUCT> <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most elegant places of devotion in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> world.
 (104) A magnificent temple rose in honour of the god of light; and his colossal figure (105) almost filled the capacious sanctuary, which was enriched with gold and gems, and adorned by the skill of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> artists.
 The deity was represented in a bending attitude, with a golden cup in his hand, pouring out a libation on the earth; as if he supplicated the venerable mother to give to his arms the cold and beauteous DAPHNE: for the spot was ennobled by fiction; and the fancy of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> poets had transported the amorous tale from the banks of the <ORG>Peneus</ORG> to those of the Orontes.
 The ancient rites of <GPE>Greece</GPE> were imitated by the royal colony of Antioch.
 A stream of prophecy, which rivalled the truth and reputation of the <NORP>Delphic</NORP> oracle, flowed from the <NORP>Castalian</NORP> fountain of Daphne.
(106) In the adjacent fields a stadium was built by a special privilege, (107) which had been purchased from Elis; the <EVENT>Olympic</EVENT> games were celebrated at the expense of the city; and a revenue of thirty thousand pounds sterling was annually applied to the public pleasures.
(108) The perpetual resort of pilgrims and spectators insensibly formed, in the neighbourhood of the temple, the stately and populous village of Daphne, which emulated the splendour, without acquiring the title, of a provincial city.
 The temple and the village were deeply bosomed in a thick grove of laurels and cypresses, which reached as far as a circumference of ten miles, and formed in the most sultry summers a cool and impenetrable shade.
 A thousand streams of the purest water, issuing from every hill, preserved the verdure of the earth and the temperature of the air; the senses were gratified with harmonious sounds and aromatic odours; and the peaceful grove was consecrated to health and joy, to luxury and love.
 The vigorous youth pursued, like Apollo, the object of his desires; and the blushing maid was warned, by the fate of Daphne, to shun the folly of unseasonable coyness.
 The soldier and the philosopher wisely avoided the temptation of this sensual paradise;(109) where pleasure, assuming the character of religion, imperceptibly dissolved the firmness of manly virtue.
 But the groves of <PERSON>Daphne</PERSON> continued for many ages to enjoy the veneration of natives and strangers; the privileges of the holy ground were enlarged by the munificence of succeeding emperors; and every generation added new ornaments to the splendour of the temple.
(110) Neglect and profanation of <PERSON>Daphne</PERSON> When Julian, on the day of the annual festival, hastened to adore the <PRODUCT>Apollo</PRODUCT> of Daphne, his devotion was raised to the highest pitch of eagerness and impatience.
 His lively imagination anticipated the grateful pomp of victims, of libations, and of incense; a long procession of youths and virgins, clothed in white robes, the symbol of their innocence; and the tumultuous concourse of an innumerable people.
 But the zeal of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> was diverted, since the reign of Christianity, into a different channel.
 Instead of hecatombs of fat oxen sacrificed by the tribes of a wealthy city to their tutelar deity, the emperor complains that he found only a single goose, provided at the expense of a priest, the pale and solitary inhabitant of this decayed temple.
(111) The altar was deserted, the oracle had been reduced to silence, and the holy ground was profaned by the introduction of <NORP>Christian</NORP> and funeral rites.
 After <GPE>Babylas</GPE> (112) (a bishop of Antioch, who died in prison in the persecution of Decius) had rested near a century in his grave, his body, by the order of the Caesar Gallus, was transported into the midst of the grove of Daphne.
 A magnificent church was erected over his remains; a portion of the sacred lands was usurped for the maintenance of the clergy, and for the burial of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of Antioch, who were ambitious of lying at the feet of their bishop; and the priests of <PRODUCT>Apollo</PRODUCT> retired, with their affrighted and indignant votaries.
 As soon as another revolution seemed to restore the fortune of Paganism, the church of St.
 <GPE>Babylas</GPE> was demolished, and new buildings were added to the mouldering edifice which had been raised by the piety of <NORP>Syrian</NORP> kings.
 But the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most serious care of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was to deliver his oppressed deity from the odious presence of the dead and living Christians, who had so effectually suppressed the voice of fraud or enthusiasm.
(113)Removal of the dead bodies, and conflagration of the temple.
The scene of infection was purified, according to the forms of ancient rituals, the bodies were decently removed; and the ministers of the church were permitted to convey the remains of St.
 <GPE>Babylas</GPE> to their former habitation within the walls of Antioch.
 The modest behaviour which might have assuaged the jealousy of an hostile government, was neglected on this occasion by the zeal of the Christians.
 The lofty car that transported the relics of <GPE>Babylas</GPE> was followed, and accompanied, and received, by an innumerable multitude, who chanted, with thundering acclamations, the <WORK_OF_ART>Psalms</WORK_OF_ART> of <PERSON>David</PERSON> the most expressive of their contempt for idols and idolaters.
 The return of the saint was a triumph; and the triumph was an insult on the religion of the emperor, who exerted his pride to dissemble his resentment.
 During the night which terminated this indiscreet procession the temple of <PERSON>Daphne</PERSON> was in flames; the statue of <PRODUCT>Apollo</PRODUCT> was consumed; and the walls of the edifice were left a naked and awful monument of ruin.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> asserted, with religious confidence, that the powerful intercession of St.
 <GPE>Babylas</GPE> had pointed the lightnings of heaven against the devoted roof: but as <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was reduced to the alternative of believing either a crime or a miracle, he chose, without hesitation, without evidence, but with some colour of probability, to impute the fire of <PERSON>Daphne</PERSON> to the revenge of the Galileans.
(114) <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> shuts the cathederal of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> Their offence, had it been sufficiently proved, might have justified the retaliation, which was immediately executed by the order of Julian, of shutting the doors, and confiscating the wealth, of the cathedral of Antioch.
 To discover the criminals who were guilty of the tumult, of the fire, or of secreting the riches of the church, several ecclesiastics were tortured;(115) and a presbyter, of the name of Theodoret, was beheaded by the sentence of the count of the East.
 But this hasty act was blamed by the emperor, who lamented, with real or affected concern, that the imprudent zeal of his ministers would tarnish his reign with the disgrace of persecution.
(116) The zeal of the ministers of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was instantly checked by the frown of their sovereign; but when the father of his country declares himself the leader of a faction, the licence of popular fury cannot easily be restrained, nor consistently punished.
 Julian, in a public composition, applauds the devotion and loyalty of the holy cities of Syria, whose pious inhabitants had destroyed, at the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> signal, the sepulchres of the Galileans; and faintly complains that they had revenged the injuries of the gods with less moderation than he should have recommended.
(117) This imperfect and reluctant confession may appear to confirm the ecclesiastical narratives—that in the cities of Gaza, Ascalon, Caesarea, Heliopolis, etc.
, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> abused, without prudence or remorse, the moment of their prosperity; that the unhappy objects of their cruelty were released from torture only by death; that, as their mangled bodies were dragged through the streets, they were pierced (such was the universal rage) by the spits of cooks, and the distaff's of enraged women; and that the entrails of <NORP>Christian</NORP> priests and virgins, after they had been tasted by those bloody fanatics, were mixed with barley, and contemptuously thrown to the unclean animals of the city.
 (118) Such scenes of religious madness exhibit the most contemptible and odious picture of human nature; but the massacre of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> attracts still more attention, from the certainty of the fact, the rank of the victims, and the splendour of the capital of Egypt.
 <PERSON>George</PERSON> of <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> George,(119) from his parents or his education, surnamed the Cappadocian, was born at <GPE>Epiphania</GPE> in Cilicia, in a fuller's shop.
 From this obscure and servile origin he raised himself by the talents of a parasite; and the patrons whom he assiduously flattered procured for their worthless dependent a lucrative commission, or contract, to supply the army with bacon.
 His employment was mean; he rendered it infamous.
 He accumulated wealth by the basest arts of fraud and corruption; but his malversations were so notorious, that <PERSON>George</PERSON> was compelled to escape from the pursuits of justice.
 After this disgrace, in which he appears to have saved his fortune at the expense of his honour, he embraced, with real or affected zeal, the profession of Arianism.
 From the love, or the ostentation, of learning, he collected a valuable library of history, rhetoric, philosophy, and theology;(120) and the choice of the prevailing faction promoted <PERSON>George</PERSON> of <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> to the throne of Athanasius.
 The entrance of the new archbishop was that of a barbarian conqueror; and each moment of his reign was polluted by cruelty and avarice.
 The <NORP>Catholics</NORP> of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> and <GPE>Egypt</GPE> were abandoned to a tyrant, qualified by nature and education to exercise the office of persecution; but he oppressed with an impartial hand the various inhabitants of his extensive diocese.
 oppresses <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> and Egypt.
 The primate of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> assumed the pomp and insolence of his lofty station; but he still betrayed the vices of his base and servile extraction.
 The merchants of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> were impoverished by the unjust and almost universal monopoly, which he acquired, of nitre, salt, paper, funerals, etc.
: and the spiritual father of a great people condescended to practice the vile and pernicious arts of an informer.
 The <NORP>Alexandrians</NORP> could never forget, nor forgive, the tax which he suggested on all the houses of the city, under an obsolete claim that the royal founder had conveyed to his successors, the <NORP>Ptolemies</NORP> and the Caesars, the perpetual property of the soil.
 The Pagans, who had been flattered with the hopes of freedom and toleration, excited his devout avarice, and the rich temples of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> were either pillaged or insulted by the haughty prelate, who exclaimed in a loud and threatening tone, "How long will these sepulchres be permitted to stand?" Under the reign of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> he was expelled by the fury, or rather by the justice, of the people; and it was not without a violent struggle that the civil and military powers of the state could restore his authority, and gratify his revenge.
 The messenger who proclaimed at <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> the accession of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> announced the downfall of the archbishop.

D.
 361, November 30.
 George, with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of his obsequious ministers, count Diodorus, and Dracontius, master of the mint, were ignominiously dragged in chains to the public prison.
 [He is massacred by the people, December 24.
] At the end of twenty-four <DATE>days</DATE> the prison was forced open by the rage of a superstitious multitude, impatient of the tedious forms of judicial proceedings.
 The enemies of gods and men expired under their cruel insults; the lifeless bodies of the archbishop and his associates were carried in triumph through the streets on the back of a camel; and the inactivity of the <NORP>Athanasian</NORP> party (121) was esteemed a shining example of evangelical patience.
 The remains of these guilty wretches were thrown into the sea; and the popular leaders of the tumult declared their resolution to disappoint the devotion of the Christians, and to intercept the future honours of these martyrs, who had been punished, like their predecessors, by the enemies of their religion.
 (122) The fears of the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> were just, and their precautions ineffectual.
 The meritorious death of the archbishop obliterated the memory of his life.
 The rival of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> was dear and sacred to the Arians, and the seeming conversion of those sectaries introduced his worship into the bosom of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
(123) The odious stranger, disguising every circumstance of time and place, assumed the mask of a martyr, a saint, and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> hero;(124).
 [and worshipped as a saint and martyr] and the infamous <PERSON>George</PERSON> of <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> has been transformed(125) into the renowned St.
 <PERSON>George</PERSON> of England, the patron of arms, of chivalry, and of the garter.
 (126) About the same time that <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was informed of the tumult of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> he received intelligence from <PERSON>Edessa</PERSON> that the proud and wealthy faction of the <NORP>Arians</NORP> had insulted the weakness of the Valentinians, and committed such disorders as ought not to be suffered with impunity in a well-regulated state.
 Without expecting the slow forms of justice, the exasperated prince directed his mandate to the magistrates of Edessa,(127) by which he confiscated the whole property of the church: the money was distributed among the soldiers; the lands were added to the domain; and this act of oppression was aggravated by the most ungenerous irony.
 The tumults of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> were doubtless of a more bloody and dangerous nature: but a <NORP>Christian</NORP> bishop had fallen by the hands of the Pagans; and the public epistle of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> affords a very lively proof of the partial spirit of his administration.
 His reproaches to the citizens of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> are mingled with expressions of esteem and tenderness; and he laments that, on this occasion, they should have departed from the gentle and generous manners which attested their <NORP>Grecian</NORP> extraction.
 He gravely censures the offence which they had committed against the laws of justice and humanity; but he recapitulates, with visible complacency, the intolerable provocations which they had so long endured from the impious tyranny of <PERSON>George</PERSON> of Cappadocia.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> admits the principle that a wise and vigorous government should chastise the insolence of the people; yet, in consideration of their founder Alexander, and of Serapis their tutelar deity, he grants a free and gracious pardon to the guilty city, for which he again feels the affection of a brother.
 (128) Restoration of Athanius, A.
D.
 362, February 21.
 After the tumult of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> had subsided, Athanasius, amidst the public acclamations, seated himself on the throne from whence his unworthy competitor had been precipitated: and as the zeal of the archbishop was tempered with discretion, the exercise of his authority tended not to inflame, but to reconcile, the minds of the people.
 His pastoral labours were not confined to the narrow limits of Egypt.
 The state of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world was present to his active and capacious mind; and the age, the merit, the reputation of Athanasius, enabled him to assume, in a moment of danger, the office of Ecclesiastical Dictator.
 (129) Three years were not yet elapsed since the majority of the bishops of the <LOC>West</LOC> had, ignorantly or reluctantly, subscribed the Confession of Rimini.
 They repented, they believed, but they dreaded the unseasonable rigour of their orthodox brethren; and if their pride was stronger than their faith, they might throw themselves into the arms of the Arians, to escape the indignity of a public penance, which must degrade them to the condition of obscure laymen.
 At the same time the domestic differences concerning the union and distinction of the divine persons were agitated with some heat among the catholic doctors; and the progress of this metaphysical controversy seemed to threaten a public and lasting division of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Latin</NORP> churches.
 By the wisdom of a select synod, to which the name and presence of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> gave the authority of a general council, the bishops who had unwarily deviated into error were admitted to the communion of the church, on the easy condition of subscribing the Nicene Creed, without any formal acknowledgment of their past fault, or any minute definition of their scholastic opinions.
 The advice of the primate of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> had already prepared the clergy of <GPE>Gaul</GPE> and Spain, of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Greece, for the reception of this salutary measure; and, notwithstanding the opposition of some ardent spirits,(130) the fear of the common enemy promoted the peace and harmony of the Christians.
(131) He is persecuted and expelled by Julian, A.
D.
 362, October 23.
 The skill and diligence of the primate of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> had improved the season of tranquillity before it was interrupted by the hostile edicts of the emperor.
(132) Julian, who despised the Christians, honoured <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> with his sincere and peculiar hatred.
 For his sake alone he introduced an arbitrary distinction, repugnant at least to the spirit of his former declarations.
 He maintained that the <NORP>Galileans</NORP> whom he had recalled from exile were not restored, by that general indulgence, to the possession of their respective churches; and he expressed his astonishment that a criminal, who had been repeatedly condemned by the judgement of the emperors, should dare to insult the majesty of the laws, and insolently usurp the archiepiscopal throne of Alexandria, without expecting the orders of his sovereign.
 As a punishment for the imaginary offence, he again banished <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> from the city; and he was pleased to suppose that this act of justice would be highly agreeable to his pious subjects.
 The pressing solicitations of the people soon convinced him that the majority of the <NORP>Alexandrians</NORP> were Christians; and that the greatest part of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> were firmly attached to the cause of their oppressed primate.
 But the knowledge of their sentiments, instead of persuading him to recall his decree, provoked him to extend to all <GPE>Egypt</GPE> the term of the exile of Athanasius.
 The zeal of the multitude rendered <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> still more inexorable: he was alarmed by the danger of leaving at the head of the tumultuous city a daring and popular leader; and the language of his resentment discovers the opinion which he entertained of the courage and abilities of Athanasius.
 The execution of the sentence was still delayed by the caution or negligence of Ecdicius, praefect of Egypt, who was at length awakened from his lethargy by a severe reprimand.
 This epistle was enforced by a short postscript written with the emperor's own hand.
 The death of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> was not expressly commanded; but the praefect of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> understood that it was safer for him to exceed than to neglect the orders of an irritated master.
 The archbishop prudently retired to the monasteries of the Desert, eluded with his usual dexterity, the snares of the enemy; and lived to triumph over the ashes of a prince who, in words of formidable import, had declared his wish that the whole venom of the <NORP>Galilean</NORP> school were contained in the single person of Athanasius.
(134) Zeal and imprudence of the Christians.
 I have endeavoured faithfully to represent the artful system by which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> proposed to obtain the effects, without incurring the guilt of reproach, of persecution.
 But if the deadly spirit of fanaticism perverted the heart and understanding of a virtuous prince, it must, at the same time, be confessed, that the real suffering of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> were inflamed and magnified by human passions and religious enthusiasm.
 The meekness and resignation which had distinguished the primitive disciples of the <WORK_OF_ART>Gospel</WORK_OF_ART> was the object of the applause, rather than of the imitation, of their successors.
 The Christians, who had now possessed above forty years the civil and ecclesiastical government of the empire, had contracted the insolent vices of prosperity, (135) and the habit of believing that the saints alone were entitled to reign over the earth.
 As soon as the enmity of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> deprived the clergy of the privileges which had been conferred by the favour of Constantine, they complained of the most cruel oppression; and the free toleration of idolaters and heretics was a subject of grief and scandal to the orthodox party.
 (136) The acts of violence, which were no longer countenanced by the magistrates, were still committed by the zeal of the people.
 At Pessinus the altar of <PERSON>Cybele</PERSON> was overturned almost in the presence of the emperor, and in the city of Caesarea, in Cappadocia, the temple of Fortune, the sole place of worship which had been left to the Pagans, was destroyed by the rage of a popular tumult.
 On these occasions, a Prince who felt for the honour of the gods was not disposed to interrupt the course of justice; and his mind was still more deeply exasperated when he found that the fanatics, who had deserved and suffered the punishment of incendiaries, were rewarded with the honours of martyrdom.
(137) The <NORP>Christian</NORP> subjects of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were assured of the hostile designs of their sovereign; and, to their jealous apprehension, every circumstance of his government might afford some rounds of discontent and suspicion.
 In the ordinary administration of the laws, the Christians, who formed so large a part of the people, must frequently be condemned; but their indulgent brethren, without examining the merits of the cause, presumed their innocence, allowed their claims, and imputed the severity of their judge to the partial malice of religious persecution.
(138) These present hardships, intolerable as they might appear, were represented as a slight prelude of the impending calamities.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> considered <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> as a cruel and crafty tyrant, who suspended the execution of his revenge till he should return victorious from the Persian war.
 They expected that, as soon as he had triumphed over the foreign enemies of Rome, he would lay aside the irksome mask of dissimulation; that the amphitheatres would stream with the blood of hermits and bishops; and that the <NORP>Christians</NORP> who still persevered in the profession of the faith would be deprived of the common benefits of nature and society.
(139) Every calumny(140) that could wound the reputation of the <PERSON>Apostate</PERSON> was credulously embraced by the fears and hatred of his adversaries; and their indiscreet clamours provoked the temper of a sovereign whom it was their duty to respect, and their interest to flatter.
 They still protested that prayers and tears were their only weapons against the impious tyrant, whose head they devoted to the justice of offended Heaven.
 But they insinuated, with sullen resolution, that their submission was no longer the effect of weakness; and that, in the imperfect state of human virtue, the patience which is founded on principle may be exhausted by persecution.
 It is impossible to determine how far the zeal of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> would have prevailed over his good sense and humanity; but, if we seriously reflect on the strength and spirit of the church, we shall be convinced that, before the emperor could have extinguished the religion of Christ, he must have involved his country in the horrors of a civil war.
