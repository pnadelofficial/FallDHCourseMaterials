Origin and Doctrine of the Paulicians— Their Persecution by the <NORP>Greek</NORP> Emperors— Revolt in Armenia, etc.
 Transplantation into Thrace— Propagation in the West— The Seeds, Character, and Consequences of the ReformationSupine superstition of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church In the profession of Christianity, the variety of national characters may be clearly distinguished.
 The natives of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and <GPE>Egypt</GPE> abandoned their lives to lazy and contemplative devotion: <GPE>Rome</GPE> again aspired to the dominion of the world; and the wit of the lively and loquacious <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was consumed in the disputes of metaphysical theology.
 The incomprehensible mysteries of the <LOC>Trinity</LOC> and Incarnation, instead of commanding their silent submission, were agitated in vehement and subtle controversies, which enlarged their faith at the expense, perhaps, of their charity and reason.
 From the council of <GPE>Nice</GPE> to the end of the seventh century, the peace and unity of the church was invaded by these spiritual wars; and so deeply did they affect the decline and fall of the empire, that the historian has too often been compelled to attend the synods, to explore the creeds, and to enumerate the sects, of this busy period of ecclesiastical annals.
 From the beginning of the eighth century to the last ages of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire, the sound of controversy was seldom heard: curiosity was exhausted, zeal was fatigued, and, in the decrees of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> councils, the articles of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> faith had been irrevocably defined.
 The spirit of dispute, however vain and pernicious, requires some energy and exercise of the mental faculties; and the prostrate <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were content to fast, to pray, and to believe in blind obedience to the patriarch and his clergy.
 During a long dream of superstition, the Virgin and the Saints, their visions and miracles, their relics and images, were preached by the monks, and worshipped by the people; and the appellation of people might be extended, without injustice, to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ranks of civil society.
 At an unseasonable moment, the <NORP>Isaurian</NORP> emperors attempted somewhat rudely to awaken their subjects: under their influence reason might obtain some proselytes, a far greater number was swayed by interest or fear; but the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> world embraced or deplored their visible deities, and the restoration of images was celebrated as the feast of orthodoxy.
 In this passive and unanimous state the ecclesiastical rulers were relieved from the toil, or deprived of the pleasure, of persecution.
 The <NORP>Pagans</NORP> had disappeared; the <NORP>Jews</NORP> were silent and obscure; the disputes with the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were rare and remote hostilities against a national enemy; and the sects of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and <GPE>Syria</GPE> enjoyed a free toleration under the shadow of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> caliphs.
 About the middle of the seventh century, a branch of <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was selected as the victims of spiritual tyranny; their patience was at length exasperated to despair and rebellion; and their exile has scattered over the <LOC>West</LOC> the seeds of reformation.
 These important events will justify some inquiry into the doctrine and story of the PAULICIANS; (1) and, as they cannot plead for themselves, our candid criticism will magnify the good, and abate or suspect the evil, that is reported by their adversaries.
 Origins of the Paulicans, or disciples of St.
 Paul, A.
D.
 660, etc The Gnostics, who had distracted the infancy, were oppressed by the greatness and authority, of the church.
 Instead of emulating or surpassing the wealth, learning, and numbers of the Catholics, their obscure remnant was driven from the capitals of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, and confined to the villages and mountains along the borders of the Euphrates.
 Some vestige of the <NORP>Marcionites</NORP> may be detected in the fifth century; (2) but the numerous sects were finally lost in the odious name of the Manichaeans; and these heretics, who presumed to reconcile the doctrines of <NORP>Zoroaster</NORP> and Christ, were pursued by the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> religions with equal and unrelenting hatred.
 Under the grandson of Heraclius, in the neighbourhood of Samosata, more famous for the birth of <PERSON>Lucian</PERSON> than for the title of a <NORP>Syrian</NORP> kingdom, a reformer arose, esteemed by the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> as the chosen messenger of truth.
 In his humble dwelling of Mananalis, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> entertained a deacon, who returned from <NORP>Syrian</NORP> captivity, and received the inestimable gift of the New Testament, which was already concealed from the vulgar by the prudence of the Greek, and perhaps of the Gnostic, clergy.
 (3) These books became the measure of his studies and the rule of his faith; and the Catholics, who dispute his interpretation, acknowledge that his text was genuine and sincere.
 But he attached himself with peculiar devotion to the writings and character of St.
 Paul: the name of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> is derived by their enemies from some unknown and domestic teacher; but I am confident that they gloried in their affinity to the apostle of the Gentiles.
 His disciples, Titus, Timothy, Sylvanus, Tychicus, were represented by <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and his fellow-labourers: the names of the apostolic churches were applied to the congregations which they assembled in <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and Cappadocia; and this innocent allegory revived the example and memory of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ages.
 Their bible In the Gospel, and the Epistles of St.
 Paul, his faithful follower investigated the <PERSON>Creed</PERSON> of primitive Christianity; and, whatever might be the success, a <NORP>Protestant</NORP> reader will applaud the spirit, of the inquiry.
 But if the <WORK_OF_ART>Scriptures</WORK_OF_ART> of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> were pure, they were not perfect.
 Their founders rejected the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Epistles of St.
 Peter, (4) the apostle of the circumcision, whose dispute with their favourite for the observance of the law could not easily be forgiven.
 (5) They agreed with their <NORP>Gnostic</NORP> brethren in the universal contempt for the Old Testament, the books of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and the prophets, which have been consecrated by the decrees of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 With equal boldness, and doubtless with more reason, Constantine, the new Sylvanus, disclaimed the visions, which, in so many bulky and splendid volumes, had been published by the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> sects; (6) the fabulous productions of the <LANGUAGE>Hebrew</LANGUAGE> patriarchs and the sages of the East; the spurious gospels, epistles, and acts, which in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age had overwhelmed the orthodox code; the theology of Manes, and the authors of the kindred heresies; and the <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> generations, or aeons, which had been created by the fruitful fancy of Valentine.
 The <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> sincerely condemned the memory and opinions of the <NORP>Manichaean</NORP> sect, and complained of the injustice which impressed that invidious name on the simple votaries of St.
 Paul and of Christ.
 The simplicity of their belief and worship.
 Of the ecclesiastical chain, many links had been broken by the <NORP>Paulician</NORP> reformers; and their liberty was enlarged, as they reduced the number of masters, at whose voice profane reason must bow to mystery and miracle.
 The early separation of the <NORP>Gnostics</NORP> had preceded the establishment of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> worship; and against the gradual innovations of discipline and doctrine they were as strongly guarded by habit and aversion, as by the silence of St.
 Paul and the evangelists.
 The objects which had been transformed by the magic of superstition, appeared to the eyes of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> in their genuine and naked colours.
 An image made without hands was the common workmanship of a mortal artist, to whose skill alone the wood and canvas must be indebted for their merit or value.
 The miraculous relics were a heap of bones and ashes, destitute of life or virtue, or of any relation, perhaps, with the person to whom they were ascribed.
 The true and vivifying cross was a piece of sound or rotten timber, the body and blood of Christ, a loaf of bread and a cup of wine, the gifts of nature and the symbols of grace.
 The mother of God was degraded from her celestial honours and immaculate virginity; and the saints and angels were no longer solicited to exercise the laborious office of meditation in heaven, and ministry upon earth.
 In the practice, or at least in the theory, of the sacraments, the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> were inclined to abolish all visible objects of worship, and the words of the gospel were, in their judgment, the baptism and communion of the faithful.
 They indulged a convenient latitude for the interpretation of Scripture: and as often as they were pressed by the literal sense, they could escape to the intricate mazes of figure and allegory.
 Their utmost diligence must have been employed to dissolve the connection between the Old and the New Testament; since they adored the latter as the oracles of God, and abhorred the former as the fabulous and absurd invention of men or daemons.
 We cannot be surprised, that they should have found in the <WORK_OF_ART>Gospel</WORK_OF_ART> the orthodox mystery of the Trinity: but, instead of confessing the human nature and substantial sufferings of Christ, they amused their fancy with a celestial body that passed through the virgin like water through a pipe; with a fantastic crucifixion, that eluded the vain and important malice of the Jews.
 They hold the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principles of the <NORP>Magians</NORP> and <ORG>Manichaens</ORG> A creed thus simple and spiritual was not adapted to the genius of the times; (7) and the rational Christian, who might have been contented with the light yoke and easy burden of <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> and his apostles, was justly offended, that the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> should dare to violate the unity of God, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> article of natural and revealed religion.
 Their belief and their trust was in the Father, of Christ, of the human soul, and of the invisible world.
 But they likewise held the eternity of matter; a stubborn and rebellious substance, the origin of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> principle of an active being, who has created this visible world, and exercises his temporal reign till the final consummation of death and sin.
 (8) The appearances of moral and physical evil had established the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principles in the ancient philosophy and religion of the East; from whence this doctrine was transfused to the various swarms of the Gnostics.
 A thousand shades may be devised in the nature and character of Ahriman, from a rival god to a subordinate daemon, from passion and frailty to pure and perfect malevolence: but, in spite of our efforts, the goodness, and the power, of <PERSON>Ormusd</PERSON> are placed at the opposite extremities of the line; and every step that approaches the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> must recede in equal proportion from the other.
 (9) The establishment of the <NORP>Paulicans</NORP> in Armenia, Pontus, etc .
 The apostolic labours of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> <PERSON>Sylvanus</PERSON> soon multiplied the number of his disciples, the secret recompense of spiritual ambition.
 The remnant of the <NORP>Gnostic</NORP> sects, and especially the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> of Armenia, were united under his standard; many <NORP>Catholics</NORP> were converted or seduced by his arguments; and he preached with success in the regions of <GPE>Pontus</GPE> (10) and Cappadocia, which had long since imbibed the religion of Zoroaster.
 The <NORP>Paulician</NORP> teachers were distinguished only by their <WORK_OF_ART>Scriptural</WORK_OF_ART> names, by the modest title of Fellow-pilgrims, by the austerity of their lives, their zeal or knowledge, and the credit of some extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit.
 But they were incapable of desiring, or at least of obtaining, the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> prelacy; such anti- <NORP>Christian</NORP> pride they bitterly censured; and even the rank of elders or presbyters was condemned as an institution of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> synagogue.
 The new sect was loosely spread over the provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor to the westward of the Euphrates; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> of their principal congregations represented the churches to which St.
 Paul had addressed his epistles; and their founder chose his residence in the neighbourhood of Colonia, (11) in the same district of <GPE>Pontus</GPE> which had been celebrated by the altars of <PERSON>Bellona</PERSON> (12) and the miracles of Gregory.
 (13) Persecution of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors.
 After a mission of twenty-seven years, Sylvanus, who had retired from the tolerating government of the Arabs, fell a sacrifice to <NORP>Roman</NORP> persecution.
 The laws of the pious emperors, which seldom touched the lives of less odious heretics, proscribed without mercy or disguise the tenets, the books, and the persons of the <NORP>Montanists</NORP> and Manichaeans: the books were delivered to the flames; and all who should presume to secrete such writings, or to profess such opinions, were devoted to an ignominious death.
 (14) A <NORP>Greek</NORP> minister, armed with legal and military powers, appeared at <GPE>Colonia</GPE> to strike the shepherd, and to reclaim, if possible, the lost sheep.
 By a refinement of cruelty, <PERSON>Simeon</PERSON> placed the unfortunate <PERSON>Sylvanus</PERSON> before a line of his disciples, who were commanded, as the price of their pardon and the proof of their repentance, to massacre their spiritual father.
 They turned aside from the impious office; the stones dropped from their filial hands, and of the whole number, only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> executioner could be found, a new David, as he is styled by the Catholics, who boldly overthrew the giant of heresy.
 This apostate (Justin was his name) again deceived and betrayed his unsuspecting brethren, and a new conformity to the acts of St.
 Paul may be found in the conversion of Simeon: like the apostle, he embraced the doctrine which he had been sent to persecute, renounced his honours and fortunes, and required among the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> the fame of a missionary and a martyr.
 They were not ambitious of martyrdom, (15) but in a calamitous period of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and fifty years, their patience sustained whatever zeal could inflict; and power was insufficient to eradicate the obstinate vegetation of fanaticism and reason.
 From the blood and ashes of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> victims, a succession of teachers and congregations repeatedly arose: amidst their foreign hostilities, they found leisure for domestic quarrels: they preached, they disputed, they suffered; and the virtues, the apparent virtues, of Sergius, in a pilgrimage of thirty-three years, are reluctantly confessed by the orthodox historians.
 (16) The native cruelty of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> was stimulated by a pious cause; and he vainly hoped to extinguish, in a single conflagration, the name and memory of the Paulicians.
 By their primitive simplicity, their abhorrence of popular superstition, the <NORP>Iconoclast</NORP> princes might have been reconciled to some erroneous doctrines; but they themselves were exposed to the calumnies of the monks, and they chose to be the tyrants, lest they should be accused as the accomplices, of the Manichaeans.
 Such a reproach has sullied the clemency of Nicephorus, who relaxed in their favour the severity of the penal statutes, nor will his character sustain the honour of a more liberal motive.
 The feeble <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the First, the rigid <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Armenian, were foremost in the race of persecution; but the prize must doubtless be adjudged to the sanguinary devotion of Theodora, who restored the images to the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> church.
 Her inquisitors explored the cities and mountains of the Lesser Asia, and the flatterers of the empress have affirmed that, in a short reign, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred thousand <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> were extirpated by the sword, the gibbet, or the flames.
 Her guilt or merit has perhaps been stretched beyond the measure of truth: but if the account be allowed, it must be presumed that many simple <NORP>Iconoclasts</NORP> were punished under a more odious name; and that some who were driven from the church, unwillingly took refuge in the bosom of heresy.
 Revolt of the Paulicans, A.
D.
 845-880 The most furious and desperate of rebels are the sectaries of a religion long persecuted, and at length provoked.
 In a holy cause they are no longer susceptible of fear or remorse: the justice of their arms hardens them against the feelings of humanity; and they revenge their fathers' wrongs on the children of their tyrants.
 Such have been the <NORP>Hussites</NORP> of <GPE>Bohemia</GPE> and the <NORP>Calvinists</NORP> of France, and such, in the ninth century, were the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and the adjacent provinces.
 (17) They were <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> awakened to the massacre of a governor and bishop, who exercised the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> mandate of converting or destroying the heretics; and the deepest recesses of Mount Argaeus protected their independence and revenge.
 A more dangerous and consuming flame was kindled by the persecution of Theodora, and the revolt of Carbeas, a valiant Paulician, who commanded the guards of the general of the East.
 His father had been impaled by the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> inquisitors; and religion, or at least nature, might justify his desertion and revenge.
 Five thousand of his brethren were united by the same motives; they renounced the allegiance of anti-Christian Rome; a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir introduced <PERSON>Carbeas</PERSON> to the caliph; and the commander of the faithful extended his sceptre to the implacable enemy of the Greeks.
 They fortify Tephrice, In the mountains between <GPE>Siwas</GPE> and <GPE>Trebizond</GPE> he founded or fortified the city of Tephrice, (18) which is still occupied by a fierce or licentious people, and the neighbouring hills were covered with the <NORP>Paulician</NORP> fugitives, who now reconciled the use of the <WORK_OF_ART>Bible</WORK_OF_ART> and the sword.
 During more than <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, <LOC>Asia</LOC> was afflicted by the calamities of foreign and domestic war; in their hostile inroads, the disciples of St.
 Paul were joined with those of Mahomet; and the peaceful Christians, the aged parent and tender virgin, who were delivered into barbarous servitude, might justly accuse the intolerant spirit of their sovereign.
 So urgent was the mischief, so intolerable the shame, that even the dissolute Michael, the son of Theodora, was compelled to march in person against the Paulicians: he was defeated under the walls of Samosata; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor fled before the heretics whom his mother had condemned to the flames.
 The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> fought under the same banners, but the victory was ascribed to Carbeas; and the captive generals, with more than a hundred tribunes, were either released by his avarice, or tortured by his fanaticism.
 The valour and ambition of Chrysocheir, (19) his successor, embraced a wider circle of rapine and revenge.
 In alliance with his faithful Moslems, he boldly penetrated into the heart of Asia; the troops of the frontier and the palace were repeatedly overthrown; and pillage <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor.
 the edicts of persecution were answered by the pillage of <GPE>Nice</GPE> and Nicomedia, of <GPE>Ancyra</GPE> and Ephesus; nor could the apostle St.
 John protect from violation his city and sepulchre.
 The cathedral of <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> was turned into a stable for mules and horses; and the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> vied with the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> in their contempt and abhorrence of images and relics.
 It is not unpleasing to observe the triumph of rebellion over the same despotism which had disdained the prayers of an injured people.
 The emperor Basil, the Macedonian, was reduced to sue for peace, to offer a ransom for the captives, and to request, in the language of moderation and charity, that <PERSON>Chrysocheir</PERSON> would spare his fellow-Christians, and content himself with a royal donative of gold and silver and silk garments.
 The reluctant <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> suspended the treaty, accepted the defiance, and led his army into the land of heresy, which he wasted with fire and sword.
 The open country of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> was exposed to the same calamities which they had inflicted; but when he had explored the strength of Tephrice, the ultitude of the Barbarians, and the ample magazines of arms and provisions, he desisted with a sigh from the hopeless siege.
 On his return to Constantinople, he laboured, by the foundation of convents and churches, to secure the aid of his celestial patrons, of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the archangel and the prophet Elijah; and it was his daily prayer that he might live to transpierce, with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> arrows, the head of his impious adversary.
 Beyond his expectations, the wish was accomplished: after a successful inroad, <PERSON>Chrysocheir</PERSON> was surprised and slain in his retreat; and the rebel's head was triumphantly presented at the foot of the throne.
 On the reception of this welcome trophy, <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> instantly called for his bow, discharged <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> arrows with unerring aim, and accepted the applause of the court, who hailed the victory of the royal archer.
 Their decline.
 With Chrysocheir, the glory of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> faded and withered: (20) on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> expedition of the emperor, the impregnable Tephrice, was deserted by the heretics, who sued for mercy or escaped to the borders.
 The city was ruined, but the spirit of independence survived in the mountains: the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> defended, above a century, their religion and liberty, infested the <NORP>Roman</NORP> limits, and maintained their perpetual alliance with the enemies of the empire and the gospel.
 Their transplantation from <GPE>Armenia</GPE> to Thrace.
 About the middle of the eight century, Constantine, surnamed <PERSON>Copronymus</PERSON> by the worshippers of images, had made an expedition into Armenia, and found, in the cities of <GPE>Melitene</GPE> and Theodosiopolis, a great number of Paulicians, his kindred heretics.
 As a favour, or punishment, he transplanted them from the banks of the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Thrace; and by this emigration their doctrine was introduced and diffused in Europe.
 (21) If the sectaries of the metropolis were soon mingled with the promiscuous mass, those of the country struck a deep root in a foreign soil.
 The <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> resisted the storms of persecution, maintained a secret correspondence with their <NORP>Armenian</NORP> brethren, and gave aid and comfort to their preachers, who solicited, not without success, the infant faith of the Bulgarians.
 (22) In the tenth century, they were restored and multiplied by a more powerful colony, which John Zimisces (23) transported from the Chalybian hills to the valleys of Mount Haemus.
 The <NORP>Oriental</NORP> clergy who would have preferred the destruction, impatiently sighed for the absence, of the Manichaeans: the warlike emperor had felt and esteemed their valour: their attachment to the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> was pregnant with mischief; but, on the side of the Danube, against the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of Scythia, their service might be useful, and their loss would be desirable.
 Their exile in a distant land was softened by a free toleration: the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> held the city of <GPE>Philippopolis</GPE> and the keys of Thrace; the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> were their subjects; the <NORP>Jacobite</NORP> emigrants their associates: they occupied a line of villages and castles in <GPE>Macedonia</GPE> and Epirus; and many native <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> were associated to the communion of arms and heresy.
 As long as they were awed by power and treated with moderation, their voluntary bands were distinguished in the armies of the empire; and the courage of these dogs, ever greedy of war, ever thirsty of human blood, is noticed with astonishment, and almost with reproach, by the pusillanimous Greeks.
 The same spirit rendered them arrogant and contumacious: they were easily provoked by caprice or injury; and their privileges were often violated by the faithless bigotry of the government and clergy.
 In the midst of the Norman war, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand five hundred <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> deserted the standard of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> Comnenus, (24) and retired to their native homes.
 He dissembled till the moment of revenge; invited the chiefs to a friendly conference; and punished the innocent and guilty by imprisonment, confiscation, and baptism.
 In an interval of peace, the emperor undertook the pious office of reconciling them to the church and state: his winter quarters were fixed at Philippopolis; and the <ORDINAL>thirteenth</ORDINAL> apostle, as he is styled by his pious daughter, consumed whole days and nights in theological controversy.
 His arguments were fortified, their obstinacy was melted, by the honours and rewards which he bestowed on the most eminent proselytes; and a new city, surrounded with gardens, enriched with immunities, and dignified with his own name, was founded by <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> for the residence of his vulgar converts.
 The important station of <GPE>Philippopolis</GPE> was wrested from their hands; the contumacious leaders were secured in a dungeon, or banished from their country; and their lives were spared by the prudence, rather than the mercy, of an emperor, at whose command a poor and solitary heretic was burnt alive before the church of St.
 Sophia.
 (25) But the proud hope of eradicating the prejudices of a nation was speedily overturned by the invincible zeal of the Paulicians, who ceased to dissemble or refused to obey.
 After the departure and death of Alexius, they soon resumed their civil and religious laws.
 In the beginning of the <ORDINAL>thirteenth</ORDINAL> century, their pope or primate (a manifest corruption) resided on the confines of Bulgaria, Croatia, and Dalmatia, and governed, by his vicars, the filial congregations of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and France.
 (26) From that aera, a minute scrutiny might prolong and perpetuate the chain of tradition.
 At the end of the last age, the sect or colony still inhabited the valleys of Mount Haemus, where their ignorance and poverty were more frequently tormented by the <NORP>Greek</NORP> clergy than by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> government.
 The modern <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> have lost all memory of their origin; and their religion is disgraced by the worship of the cross, and the practice of bloody sacrifice, which some captives have imported from the wilds of Tartary.
 (27) Their introduction into <GPE>Italy</GPE> and France.
 In the West, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> teachers of the <NORP>Manichaean</NORP> theology had been repulsed by the people, or suppressed by the prince.
 The favour and success of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> in the eleventh and twelfth centuries must be imputed to the strong, though secret, discontent which armed the most pious <NORP>Christians</NORP> against the church of Rome.
 Her avarice was oppressive, her despotism odious; less degenerate perhaps than the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> in the worship of saints and images, her innovations were more rapid and scandalous: she had rigorously defined and imposed the doctrine of transubstantiation: the lives of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy were more corrupt, and the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> bishops might pass for the successors of the apostles, if they were compared with the lordly prelates, who wielded by turns the crosier, the sceptre, and the sword.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> different roads might introduce the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> into the heart of Europe.
 After the conversion of Hungary, the pilgrims who visited <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> might safely follow the course of the Danube: in their journey and return they passed through Philippopolis; and the sectaries, disguising their name and heresy, might accompany the <NORP>French</NORP> or <NORP>German</NORP> caravans to their respective countries.
 The trade and dominion of <GPE>Venice</GPE> pervaded the coast of the Adriatic, and the hospitable republic opened her bosom to foreigners of every climate and religion.
 Under the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> standard, the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> were often transported to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily: in peace and war, they freely conversed with strangers and natives, and their opinions were silently propagated in Rome, Milan, and the kingdoms beyond the Alps.
 (28) It was soon discovered, that many thousand <NORP>Catholics</NORP> of every rank, and of either sex, had embraced the <NORP>Manichaean</NORP> heresy; and the flames which consumed <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> canons of <GPE>Orleans</GPE> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act and signal of persecution.
 The Bulgarians, (29) a name so innocent in its origin, so odious in its application, spread their branches over the face of Europe.
 United in common hatred of idolatry and Rome, they were connected by a form of episcopal and presbyterian government; their various sects were discriminated by some fainter or darker shades of theology; but they generally agreed in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principles, the contempt of the Old Testament and the denial of the body of Christ, either on the cross or in the eucharist.
 A confession of simple worship and blameless manners is extorted from their enemies; and so high was their standard of perfection, that the increasing congregations were divided into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes of disciples, of those who practised, and of those who aspired.
Persecution of the Albigeois, A.
D.
 1200, etc.
 It was in the country of the Albigeois, (30) in the southern provinces of France, that the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> were most deeply implanted; and the same vicissitudes of martyrdom and revenge which had been displayed in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates, were repeated in the <ORDINAL>thirteenth</ORDINAL> century on the banks of the Rhone.
 The laws of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> emperors were revived by <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.
 The insurgents of <PERSON>Tephrice</PERSON> were represented by the barons and cities of Languedoc: Pope Innocent III.
 surpassed the sanguinary fame of Theodora.
 It was in cruelty alone that her soldiers could equal the heroes of the Crusades, and the cruelty of her priests was far excelled by the founders of the Inquisition; (31) an office more adapted to confirm, than to refute, the belief of an evil principle.
 The visible assemblies of the Paulicians, or Albigeois, were extirpated by fire and sword; and the bleeding remnant escaped by flight, concealment, or <NORP>Catholic</NORP> conformity.
 But the invincible spirit which they had kindled still lived and breathed in the <NORP>Western</NORP> world.
 In the state, in the church, and even in the cloister, a latent succession was preserved of the disciples of St.
 Paul; who protested against the tyranny of Rome, embraced the <WORK_OF_ART>Bible</WORK_OF_ART> as the rule of faith, and purified their creed from all the visions of the <NORP>Gnostic</NORP> theology.
 The struggles of <GPE>Wickliff</GPE> in England, of <GPE>Huss</GPE> in Bohemia, were premature and ineffectual; but the names of Zuinglius, Luther, and Calvin, are pronounced with gratitude as the deliverers of nations.
 Chracter and consequences of the reformation.
 A philosopher, who calculates the degree of their merit and the value of their reformation, will prudently ask from what articles of faith, above or against our reason, they have enfranchised the Christians; for such enfranchisement is doubtless a benefit so far as it may be compatible with truth and piety.
 After a fair discussion, we shall rather be surprised by the timidity, than scandalized by the freedom, of our <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> reformers.
 (32) With the Jews, they adopted the belief and defence of all the <LANGUAGE>Hebrew</LANGUAGE> Scriptures, with all their prodigies, from the garden of <LOC>Eden</LOC> to the visions of the prophet Daniel; and they were bound, like the Catholics, to justify against the <NORP>Jews</NORP> the abolition of a divine law.
 In the great mysteries of the <LOC>Trinity</LOC> and Incarnation the reformers were severely orthodox: they freely adopted the theology of the four, or the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> councils; and with the <NORP>Athanasian</NORP> creed, they pronounced the eternal damnation of all who did not believe the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> faith.
 Transubstantiation, the invisible change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, is a tenet that may defy the power of argument and pleasantry; but instead of consulting the evidence of their senses, of their sight, their feeling, and their taste, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Protestants</NORP> were entangled in their own scruples, and awed by the words of <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> in the institution of the sacrament.
 <PERSON>Luther</PERSON> maintained a corporeal, and <PERSON>Calvin</PERSON> a real, presence of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> in the eucharist; and the opinion of Zuinglius, that it is no more than a spiritual communion, a simple memorial, has slowly prevailed in the reformed churches.
 (33) But the loss of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mystery was amply compensated by the stupendous doctrines of original sin, redemption, faith, grace, and predestination, which have been strained from the epistles of St.
 Paul.
 These subtile questions had most assuredly been prepared by the fathers and schoolmen; but the final improvement and popular use may be attributed to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> reformers, who enforced them as the absolute and essential terms of salvation.
 Hitherto the weight of supernatural belief inclines against the Protestants; and many a sober <NORP>Christian</NORP> would rather admit that a wafer is God, than that God is a cruel and capricious tyrant.
 Yet the services of <PERSON>Luther</PERSON> and his rivals are solid and important; and the philosopher must own his obligations to these fearless enthusiasts.
 (34) I.
 By their hands the lofty fabric of superstition, from the abuse of indulgences to the intercession of the Virgin, has been levelled with the ground.
 Myriads of both sexes of the monastic profession were restored to the liberty and labours of social life.
 A hierarchy of saints and angels, of imperfect and subordinate deities, were stripped of their temporal power, and reduced to the enjoyment of celestial happiness; their images and relics were banished from the church; and the credulity of the people was no longer nourished with the daily repetition of miracles and visions.
 The imitation of <NORP>Paganism</NORP> was supplied by a pure and spiritual worship of prayer and thanksgiving, the most worthy of man, the least unworthy of the Deity.
 It only remains to observe, whether such sublime simplicity be consistent with popular devotion; whether the vulgar, in the absence of all visible objects, will not be inflamed by enthusiasm, or insensibly subside in languor and indifference.
 II.
 The chain of authority was broken, which restrains the bigot from thinking as he pleases, and the slave from speaking as he thinks: the popes, fathers, and councils, were no longer the supreme and infallible judges of the world; and each <NORP>Christian</NORP> was taught to acknowledge no law but the Scriptures, no interpreter but his own conscience.
 This freedom, however, was the consequence, rather than the design, of the Reformation.
 The patriot reformers were ambitious of succeeding the tyrants whom they had dethroned.
 They imposed with equal rigour their creeds and confessions; they asserted the right of the magistrate to punish heretics with death.
 The pious or personal animosity of <PERSON>Calvin</PERSON> proscribed in <PERSON>Servetus</PERSON> (35) the guilt of his own rebellion; (36) and the flames of Smithfield, in which he was afterwards consumed, had been kindled for the <NORP>Anabaptists</NORP> by the zeal of Cranmer.
 (37) The nature of the tiger was the same, but he was gradually deprived of his teeth and fangs.
 A spiritual and temporal kingdom was possessed by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; the <NORP>Protestant</NORP> doctors were subjects of an humble rank, without revenue or jurisdiction.
 His decrees were consecrated by the antiquity of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church: their arguments and disputes were submitted to the people; and their appeal to private judgment was accepted beyond their wishes, by curiosity and enthusiasm.
 Since the days of <PERSON>Luther</PERSON> and Calvin, a secret reformation has been silently working in the bosom of the reformed churches; many weeds of prejudice were eradicated; and the disciples of <PERSON>Erasmus</PERSON> (38) diffused a spirit of freedom and moderation.
 The liberty of conscience has been claimed as a common benefit, an inalienable right: (39) the free governments of <GPE>Holland</GPE> (40) and <GPE>England</GPE> (41) introduced the practice of toleration; and the narrow allowance of the laws has been enlarged by the prudence and humanity of the times.
 In the exercise, the mind has understood the limits of its powers, and the words and shadows that might amuse the child can no longer satisfy his manly reason.
 The volumes of controversy are overspread with cobwebs: the doctrine of a <NORP>Protestant</NORP> church is far removed from the knowledge or belief of its private members; and the forms of orthodoxy, the articles of faith, are subscribed with a sigh, or a smile, by the modern clergy.
 Yet the friends of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> are alarmed at the boundless impulse of inquiry and scepticism.
 The predictions of the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> are accomplished: the web of mystery is unravelled by the Arminians, Arians, and Socinians, whose number must not be computed from their separate congregations; and the pillars of <WORK_OF_ART>Revelation</WORK_OF_ART> are shaken by those men who preserve the name without the substance of religion, who indulge the license without the temper of philosophy.
