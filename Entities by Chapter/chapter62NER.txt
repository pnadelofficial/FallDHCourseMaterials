 In the long and barren pages of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> annals, (1) it would not be an easy task to equal the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> characters of <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> Lascaris, A.
D.
 1204-1222.
 <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> <PERSON>Lascaris</PERSON> and <PERSON>John</PERSON> Ducas Vataces, (2) who replanted and upheld the <NORP>Roman</NORP> standard at <PERSON>Nice</PERSON> in Bithynia.
 The difference of their virtues was happily suited to the diversity of their situation.
 In his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> efforts, the fugitive <PERSON>Lascaris</PERSON> commanded only <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> cities and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand soldiers: his reign was the season of generous and active despair: in every military operation he staked his life and crown; and his enemies of the <GPE>Hellespont</GPE> and the Maeander, were surprised by his celerity and subdued by his boldness.
 A victorious reign of <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> years expanded the principality of <PERSON>Nice</PERSON> to the magnitude of an empire.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> Ducas Vataces, A.
D.
 1222-1255, October 30.
 The throne of his successor and son-in-law <PERSON>Vataces</PERSON> was founded on a more solid basis, a larger scope, and more plentiful resources; and it was the temper, as well as the interest, of <PERSON>Vataces</PERSON> to calculate the risk, to expect the moment, and to insure the success, of his ambitious designs.
 In the decline of the Latins, I have briefly exposed the progress of the Greeks; the prudent and gradual advances of a conqueror, who, in a reign of thirty-three years, rescued the provinces from national and foreign usurpers, till he pressed on all sides the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, a leafless and sapless trunk, which must full at the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> stroke of the axe.
 But his interior and peaceful administration is still more deserving of notice and praise.
 (3) The calamities of the times had wasted the numbers and the substance of the Greeks; the motives and the means of agriculture were extirpated; and the most fertile lands were left without cultivation or inhabitants.
 A portion of this vacant property was occupied and improved by the command, and for the benefit, of the emperor: a powerful hand and a vigilant eye supplied and surpassed, by a skilful management, the minute diligence of a private farmer: the royal domain became the garden and granary of Asia; and without impoverishing the people, the sovereign acquired a fund of innocent and productive wealth.
 According to the nature of the soil, his lands were sown with corn or planted with vines; the pastures were filled with horses and oxen, with sheep and hogs; and when <PERSON>Vataces</PERSON> presented to the empress a crown of diamonds and pearls, he informed her, with a smile, that this precious ornament arose from the sale of the eggs of his innumerable poultry.
 The produce of his domain was applied to the maintenance of his palace and hospitals, the calls of dignity and benevolence: the lesson was still more useful than the revenue: the plough was restored to its ancient security and honour; and the nobles were taught to seek a sure and independent revenue from their estates, instead of adorning their splendid beggary by the oppression of the people, or (what is almost the same) by the favours of the court.
 The superfluous stock of corn and cattle was eagerly purchased by the Turks, with whom <PERSON>Vataces</PERSON> preserved a strict and sincere alliance; but he discouraged the importation of foreign manufactures, the costly silks of the East, and the curious labours of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> looms.
 and both his precept and example recommended simplicity of manners and the use of domestic industry.
 The education of youth and the revival of learning were the most serious objects of his care; and, without deciding the precedency, he pronounced with truth, that a prince and a philosopher (4) are the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most eminent characters of human society.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife was Irene, the daughter of <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> Lascaris, a woman more illustrious by her personal merit, the milder virtues of her sex, than by the blood of the <NORP>Angeli</NORP> and <NORP>Comneni</NORP> that flowed in her veins, and transmitted the inheritance of the empire.
 After her death he was contracted to Anne, or Constance, a natural daughter of the emperor <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second; but as the bride had not attained the years of puberty, <PERSON>Vataces</PERSON> placed in his solitary bed an <NORP>Italian</NORP> damsel of her train; and his amorous weakness bestowed on the concubine the honours, though not the title, of a lawful empress.
 His frailty was censured as a flagitious and damnable sin by the monks; and their rude invectives exercised and displayed the patience of the royal lover.
 A philosophic age may excuse a single vice, which was redeemed by a crowd of virtues; and in the review of his faults, and the more intemperate passions of Lascaris, the judgment of their contemporaries was softened by gratitude to the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> founders of the empire.
 (5) The slaves of the Latins, without law or peace, applauded the happiness of their brethren who had resumed their national freedom; and <PERSON>Vataces</PERSON> employed the laudable policy of convincing the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> of every dominion that it was their interest to be enrolled in the number of his subjects.

D.
 1259, <DATE>August</DATE> A strong shade of degeneracy is visible between <PERSON>John</PERSON> <PERSON>Vataces</PERSON> and his son Theodore; between the founder who sustained the weight, and the heir who enjoyed the splendour, of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown.
 (6) Yet the character of <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> was not devoid of energy; he had been educated in the school of his father, in the exercise of war and hunting; <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was yet spared; but in the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years of a short reign, he thrice led his armies into the heart of Bulgaria.
 His virtues were sullied by a choleric and suspicious temper: the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these may be ascribed to the ignorance of control; and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> might naturally arise from a dark and imperfect view of the corruption of mankind.
 On a march in Bulgaria, he consulted on a question of policy his principal ministers; and the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> logothete, George Acropolita, presumed to offend him by the declaration of a free and honest opinion.
 The emperor <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> unsheathed his cimeter; but his more deliberate rage reserved <PERSON>Acropolita</PERSON> for a baser punishment.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> officers of the empire was ordered to dismount, stripped of his robes, and extended on the ground in the presence of the prince and army.
 In this posture he was chastised with so many and such heavy blows from the clubs of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> guards or executioners, that when <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> commanded them to cease, the great logothete was scarcely able to rise and crawl away to his tent.
 After a seclusion of some days, he was recalled by a peremptory mandate to his seat in council; and so dead were the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> to the sense of honour and shame, that it is from the narrative of the sufferer himself that we acquire the knowledge of his disgrace.
 (7) The cruelty of the emperor was exasperated by the pangs of sickness, the approach of a premature end, and the suspicion of poison and magic.
 The lives and fortunes, the eyes and limbs, of his kinsmen and nobles, were sacrificed to each sally of passion; and before he died, the son of <PERSON>Vataces</PERSON> might deserve from the people, or at least from the court, the appellation of tyrant.
 A matron of the family of the <PERSON>Palaeologi</PERSON> had provoked his anger by refusing to bestow her beauteous daughter on the vile plebeian who was recommended by his caprice.
 Without regard to her birth or age, her body, as high as the neck, was enclosed in a sack with several cats, who were pricked with pins to irritate their fury against their unfortunate fellow-captive.
 Minority of <PERSON>John</PERSON> Lascaris, A.
D.
 1259, August.
 In his last hours the emperor testified a wish to forgive and be forgiven, a just anxiety for the fate of <PERSON>John</PERSON> his son and successor, who, at the age of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> years, was condemned to the dangers of a long minority.
 His last choice entrusted the office of guardian to the sanctity of the patriarch Arsenius, and to the courage of George Muzalon, the great domestic, who was equally distinguished by the royal favour and the public hatred.
 Since their connection with the Latins, the names and privileges of hereditary rank had insinuated themselves into the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> monarchy; and the noble families (8) were provoked by the elevation of a worthless favourite, to whose influence they imputed the errors and calamities of the late reign.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> council, after the emperor's death, Muzalon, from a lofty throne, pronounced a labored apology of his conduct and intentions: his modesty was subdued by a unanimous assurance of esteem and fidelity; and his most inveterate enemies were the loudest to salute him as the guardian and saviour of the Romans.
 Eight days were sufficient to prepare the execution of the conspiracy.
 On the ninth, the obsequies of the deceased monarch were solemnized in the cathedral of Magnesia, (9) an <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> city, where he expired, on the banks of the Hermus, and at the foot of Mount Sipylus.
 The holy rites were interrupted by a sedition of the guards; Muzalon, his brothers, and his adherents, were massacred at the foot of the altar; and the absent patriarch was associated with a new colleague, with <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> Palaeologus, the most illustrious, in birth and merit, of the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> nobles.
 (10) Family and character of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> Palaeologus.
 Of those who are proud of their ancestors, the far greater part must be content with local or domestic renown; and few there are who dare trust the memorials of their family to the public annals of their country.
 As early as the middle of the eleventh century, the noble race of the <PERSON>Palaeologi</PERSON> (11) stands high and conspicuous in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> history: it was the valiant George <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> who placed the father of the <NORP>Comneni</NORP> on the throne; and his kinsmen or descendants continue, in each generation, to lead the armies and councils of the state.
 The purple was not dishonoured by their alliance, and had the law of succession, and female succession, been strictly observed, the wife of <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> <PERSON>Lascaris</PERSON> must have yielded to her elder sister, the mother of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> Palaeologus, who afterwards raised his family to the throne.
 In his person, the splendour of birth was dignified by the merit of the soldier and statesman: in his early youth he was promoted to the office of constable or commander of the <NORP>French</NORP> mercenaries; the private expense of a day never exceeded <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; but his ambition was rapacious and profuse; and his gifts were doubled by the graces of his conversation and manners.
 The love of the soldiers and people excited the jealousy of the court, and <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> thrice escaped from the dangers in which he was involved by his own imprudence or that of his friends.
 I.
 Under the reign of Justice and Vataces, a dispute arose (12) between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> officers, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of whom accused the other of maintaining the hereditary right of the <PERSON>Palaeologi</PERSON> The cause was decided, according to the new jurisprudence of the Latins, by single combat; the defendant was overthrown; but he persisted in declaring that himself alone was guilty; and that he had uttered these rash or treasonable speeches without the approbation or knowledge of his patron Yet a cloud of suspicion hung over the innocence of the constable; he was still pursued by the whispers of malevolence; and a subtle courtier, the archbishop of Philadelphia, urged him to accept the judgment of God in the fiery proof of the ordeal.
 (13) Three days before the trial, the patient's arm was enclosed in a bag, and secured by the royal signet; and it was incumbent on him to bear a red-hot ball of iron <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> times from the altar to the rails of the sanctuary, without artifice and without injury.
 <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> eluded the dangerous experiment with sense and pleasantry.
 The archbishop started; the emperor smiled; and the absolution or pardon of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was approved by new rewards and new services.
 II.
 In the succeeding reign, as he held the government of Nice, he was secretly informed, that the mind of the absent prince was poisoned with jealousy; and that death, or blindness, would be his final reward.
 Instead of awaiting the return and sentence of Theodore, the constable, with some followers, escaped from the city and the empire; and though he was plundered by the <NORP>Turkmans</NORP> of the desert, he found a hospitable refuge in the court of the sultan.
 In the ambiguous state of an exile, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> reconciled the duties of gratitude and loyalty: drawing his sword against the Tartars; admonishing the garrisons of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> limit; and promoting, by his influence, the restoration of peace, in which his pardon and recall were honourably included.
 III.
 While he guarded the <LOC>West</LOC> against the despot of Epirus, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was again suspected and condemned in the palace; and such was his loyalty or weakness, that he submitted to be led in chains above six hundred miles from <GPE>Durazzo</GPE> to Nice.
 The civility of the messenger alleviated his disgrace; the emperor's sickness dispelled his danger; and the last breath of Theodore, which recommended his infant son, at once acknowledged the innocence and the power of Palaeologus.
 His elevation to the throne.
 But his innocence had been too unworthily treated, and his power was too strongly felt, to curb an aspiring subject in the fair field that was opened to his ambition.
 (14) In the council, after the death of Theodore, he was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to pronounce, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to violate, the oath of allegiance to Muzalon; and so dexterous was his conduct, that he reaped the benefit, without incurring the guilt, or at least the reproach, of the subsequent massacre.
 In the choice of a regent, he balanced the interests and passions of the candidates; turned their envy and hatred from himself against each other, and forced every competitor to own, that after his own claims, those of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> were best entitled to the preference.
 Under the title of great duke, he accepted or assumed, during a long minority, the active powers of government; the patriarch was a venerable name; and the factious nobles were seduced, or oppressed, by the ascendant of his genius.
 The fruits of the economy of <PERSON>Vataces</PERSON> were deposited in a strong castle on the banks of the Hermus, in the custody of the faithful Varangians: the constable retained his command or influence over the foreign troops; he employed the guards to possess the treasure, and the treasure to corrupt the guards; and whatsoever might be the abuse of the public money, his character was above the suspicion of private avarice.
 By himself, or by his emissaries, he strove to persuade every rank of subjects, that their own prosperity would rise in just proportion to the establishment of his authority.
 The weight of taxes was suspended, the perpetual theme of popular complaint; and he prohibited the trials by the ordeal and judicial combat.
 These <NORP>Barbaric</NORP> institutions were already abolished or undermined in <GPE>France</GPE> (15) and England; (16) and the appeal to the sword offended the sense of a civilized, (17) and the temper of an unwarlike, people.
 For the future maintenance of their wives and children, the veterans were grateful: the priests and the philosophers applauded his ardent zeal for the advancement of religion and learning; and his vague promise of rewarding merit was applied by every candidate to his own hopes.
 Conscious of the influence of the clergy, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> successfully labored to secure the suffrage of that powerful order.
 Their expensive journey from <PERSON>Nice</PERSON> to Magnesia, afforded a decent and ample pretence: the leading prelates were tempted by the liberality of his nocturnal visits; and the incorruptible patriarch was flattered by the homage of his new colleague, who led his mule by the bridle into the town, and removed to a respectful distance the importunity of the crowd.
 Without renouncing his title by royal descent, <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> encouraged a free discussion into the advantages of elective monarchy; and his adherents asked, with the insolence of triumph, what patient would trust his health, or what merchant would abandon his vessel, to the hereditary skill of a physician or a pilot? The youth of the emperor, and the impending dangers of a minority, required the support of a mature and experienced guardian; of an associate raised above the envy of his equals, and invested with the name and prerogatives of royalty.
 For the interest of the prince and people, without any selfish views for himself or his family, the great duke consented to guard and instruct the son of Theodore; but he sighed for the happy moment when he might restore to his firmer hands the administration of his patrimony, and enjoy the blessings of a private station.
 He was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested with the title and prerogatives of despot, which bestowed the purple ornaments and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> place in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarchy.
 It was afterwards agreed that <PERSON>John</PERSON> and <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> should be proclaimed as joint emperors, and raised on the buckler, but that the preeminence should be reserved for the birthright of the former.
 A mutual league of amity was pledged between the royal partners; and in case of a rupture, the subjects were bound, by their oath of allegiance, to declare themselves against the aggressor; an ambiguous name, the seed of discord and civil war.
 <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> was content; but, on the day of the coronation, and in the cathedral of Nice, his zealous adherents most vehemently urged the just priority of his age and merit.
 <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> emperor, A.
D.
 1260, January 1.
 The unseasonable dispute was eluded by postponing to a more convenient opportunity the coronation of <PERSON>John</PERSON> Lascaris; and he walked with a slight diadem in the train of his guardian, who alone received the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the hands of the patriarch.
 It was not without extreme reluctance that <PERSON>Arsenius</PERSON> abandoned the cause of his pupil; out the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> brandished their battle-axes; a sign of assent was extorted from the trembling youth; and some voices were heard, that the life of a child should no longer impede the settlement of the nation.
 A full harvest of honours and employments was distributed among his friends by the grateful Palaeologus.
 In his own family he created a despot and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sebastocrators; <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> Strategopulus was decorated with the title of Caesar; and that veteran commander soon repaid the obligation, by restoring <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> emperor.
 Recovery of Constantinople, A.
D.
 1261, July 25.
 It was in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> year of his reign, while he resided in the palace and gardens of Nymphaeum, (18) near Smyrna, that the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> messenger arrived at the dead of night; and the stupendous intelligence was imparted to Michael, after he had been gently waked by the tender precaution of his sister Eulogia.
 The man was unknown or obscure; he produced no letters from the victorious Caesar; nor could it easily be credited, after the defeat of <PERSON>Vataces</PERSON> and the recent failure of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> himself, that the capital had been surprised by a detachment of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers.
 As a hostage, the doubtful author was confined, with the assurance of death or an ample recompense; and the court was left some hours in the anxiety of hope and fear, till the messengers of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> arrived with the authentic intelligence, and displayed the trophies of the conquest, the sword and sceptre, (19) the buskins and bonnet, (20) of the usurper Baldwin, which he had dropped in his precipitate flight.
 A general assembly of the bishops, senators, and nobles, was immediately convened, and never perhaps was an event received with more heartfelt and universal joy.
 In a studied oration, the new sovereign of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> congratulated his own and the public fortune.
 Return of the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> emperor, A.
D.
 1261,August 14.
 So eager was the impatience of the prince and people, that <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> made his triumphal entry into <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> only twenty days after the expulsion of the Latins.
 The golden gate was thrown open at his approach; the devout conqueror dismounted from his horse; and a miraculous image of <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> the Conductress was borne before him, that the divine Virgin in person might appear to conduct him to the temple of her Son, the cathedral of St.
 Sophia.
 But after the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> transport of devotion and pride, he sighed at the dreary prospect of solitude and ruin.
 The palace was defiled with smoke and dirt, and the gross intemperance of the Franks; whole streets had been consumed by fire, or were decayed by the injuries of time; the sacred and profane edifices were stripped of their ornaments: and, as if they were conscious of their approaching exile, the industry of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> had been confined to the work of pillage and destruction.
 Trade had expired under the pressure of anarchy and distress, and the numbers of inhabitants had decreased with the opulence of the city.
 It was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> care of the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> monarch to reinstate the nobles in the palaces of their fathers; and the houses or the ground which they occupied were restored to the families that could exhibit a legal right of inheritance.
 But the far greater part was extinct or lost; the vacant property had devolved to the lord; he repeopled <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by a liberal invitation to the provinces; and the brave volunteers were seated in the capital which had been recovered by their arms.
 The <NORP>French</NORP> barons and the principal families had retired with their emperor; but the patient and humble crowd of <NORP>Latins</NORP> was attached to the country, and indifferent to the change of masters.
 Instead of banishing the factories of the Pisans, Venetians, and Genoese, the prudent conqueror accepted their oaths of allegiance, encouraged their industry, confirmed their privileges, and allowed them to live under the jurisdiction of their proper magistrates.
 Of these nations, the <NORP>Pisans</NORP> and <NORP>Venetians</NORP> preserved their respective quarters in the city; but the services and power of the <LOC>Genoese</LOC> deserved at the same time the gratitude and the jealousy of the Greeks.
 Their independent colony was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> planted at the seaport town of <GPE>Heraclea</GPE> in Thrace.
 They were speedily recalled, and settled in the exclusive possession of the suburb of Galata, an advantageous post, in which they revived the commerce, and insulted the majesty, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 (21) <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> blinds and banishes the young emperor, A.
D.
 1261, Dec.
 25.
 The recovery of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was celebrated as the aera of a new empire: the conqueror, alone, and by the right of the sword, renewed his coronation in the church of St.
 Sophia; and the name and honours of <PERSON>John</PERSON> Lascaris, his pupil and lawful sovereign, were insensibly abolished.
 But his claims still lived in the minds of the people; and the royal youth must speedily attain the years of manhood and ambition.
 By fear or conscience, <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> was restrained from dipping his hands in innocent and royal blood; but the anxiety of a usurper and a parent urged him to secure his throne by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of those imperfect crimes so familiar to the modern Greeks.
 The loss of sight incapacitated the young prince for the active business of the world; instead of the brutal violence of tearing out his eyes, the visual nerve was destroyed by the intense glare of a red-hot basin, (22) and <PERSON>John</PERSON> <PERSON>Lascaris</PERSON> was removed to a distant castle, where he spent many years in privacy and oblivion.
 Such cool and deliberate guilt may seem incompatible with remorse; but if <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> could trust the mercy of Heaven, he was not inaccessible to the reproaches and vengeance of mankind, which he had provoked by cruelty and treason.
 His cruelty imposed on a servile court the duties of applause or silence; but the clergy had a right to speak in the name of their invisible Master; and their holy legions were led by a prelate, whose character was above the temptations of hope or fear.
 After a short abdication of his dignity, <PERSON>Arsenius</PERSON> (23) had consented to ascend the ecclesiastical throne of Constantinople, and to preside in the restoration of the church.
 His pious simplicity was long deceived by the arts of Palaeologus; and his patience and submission might soothe the usurper, and protect the safety of the young prince.
 On the news of his inhuman treatment, the patriarch unsheathed the spiritual sword; and superstition, on this occasion, was enlisted in the cause of humanity and justice.
 is excommunicated by the patriarch Arsenius, A.
D.
 1262-1268.
 In a synod of bishops, who were stimulated by the example of his zeal, the patriarch pronounced a sentence of excommunication; though his prudence still repeated the name of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> in the public prayers.
 The <NORP>Eastern</NORP> prelates had not adopted the dangerous maxims of ancient Rome; nor did they presume to enforce their censures, by deposing princes, or absolving nations from their oaths of allegiance.
 But the Christian, who had been separated from God and the church, became an object of horror; and, in a turbulent and fanatic capital, that horror might arm the hand of an assassin, or inflame a sedition of the people.
 <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> felt his danger, confessed his guilt, and deprecated his judge: the act was irretrievable; the prize was obtained; and the most rigorous penance, which he solicited, would have raised the sinner to the reputation of a saint.
 The unrelenting patriarch refused to announce any means of atonement or any hopes of mercy; and condescended only to pronounce, that for so great a crime, great indeed must be the satisfaction.
 and at these words, he offered, or seemed to offer, the sword of state.
 <PERSON>Arsenius</PERSON> eagerly grasped this pledge of sovereignty; but when he perceived that the emperor was unwilling to purchase absolution at so dear a rate, he indignantly escaped to his cell, and left the royal sinner kneeling and weeping before the door.
 (24) The schism of the Arsenites, A.
D.
 1266-1312.
 The danger and scandal of this excommunication subsisted above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, till the popular clamour was assuaged by time and repentance; till the brethren of <PERSON>Arsenius</PERSON> condemned his inflexible spirit, so repugnant to the unbounded forgiveness of the gospel.
 The emperor had artfully insinuated, that, if he were still rejected at home, he might seek, in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, a more indulgent judge; but it was far more easy and effectual to find or to place that judge at the head of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> church.
 <PERSON>Arsenius</PERSON> was involved in a vague rumour of conspiracy and disaffection; some irregular steps in his ordination and government were liable to censure; a synod deposed him from the episcopal office; and he was transported under a guard of soldiers to a small island of the Propontis.
 Before his exile, he sullenly requested that a strict account might be taken of the treasures of the church; boasted, that his sole riches, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, had been earned by transcribing the psalms; continued to assert the freedom of his mind; and denied, with his last breath, the pardon which was implored by the royal sinner.
 (25) After some delay, Gregory, bishop of Adrianople, was translated to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne; but his authority was found insufficient to support the absolution of the emperor; and Joseph, a reverend monk, was substituted to that important function.
 This edifying scene was represented in the presence of the senate and the people; at the end of six years the humble penitent was restored to the communion of the faithful; and humanity will rejoice, that a milder treatment of the captive <PERSON>Lascaris</PERSON> was stipulated as a proof of his remorse.
 But the spirit of <PERSON>Arsenius</PERSON> still survived in a powerful faction of the monks and clergy, who persevered about forty-eight years in an obstinate schism.
 Their scruples were treated with tenderness and respect by <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> and his son; and the reconciliation of the <NORP>Arsenites</NORP> was the serious labor of the church and state.
 In the confidence of fanaticism, they had proposed to try their cause by a miracle; and when the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> papers, that contained their own and the adverse cause, were cast into a fiery brazier, they expected that the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> verity would be respected by the flames.
 Alas! the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> papers were indiscriminately consumed, and this unforeseen accident produced the union of a day, and renewed the quarrel of an age.
 (26) The final treaty displayed the victory of the Arsenites: the clergy abstained during <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> days from all ecclesiastical functions; a slight penance was imposed on the laity; the body of <PERSON>Arsenius</PERSON> was deposited in the sanctuary; and, in the name of the departed saint, the prince and people were released from the sins of their fathers.

 The establishment of his family was the motive, or at least the pretence, of the crime of Palaeologus; and he was impatient to confirm the succession, by sharing with his eldest son the honours of the purple.
 Reign of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> the Elder, A.

 1273, Nov.
 8-A.
D.
 1332, February 13.
 Andronicus, afterwards surnamed the Elder, was proclaimed and crowned emperor of the Romans, in the fifteenth year of his age; and, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> aera of a prolix and inglorious reign, he held that august title nine years as the colleague, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> as the successor, of his father.
 <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> himself, had he died in a private station, would have been thought more worthy of the empire; and the assaults of his temporal and spiritual enemies left him few moments to labor for his own fame or the happiness of his subjects.
 He wrested from the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> several of the noblest islands of the Archipelago, Lesbos, Chios, and Rhodes: his brother <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was sent to command in <GPE>Malvasia</GPE> and Sparta; and the eastern side of the Morea, from <GPE>Argos</GPE> and <GPE>Napoli</GPE> to Cape Thinners, was repossessed by the Greeks.
 This effusion of <NORP>Christian</NORP> blood was loudly condemned by the patriarch; and the insolent priest presumed to interpose his fears and scruples between the arms of princes.
 But in the prosecution of these western conquests, the countries beyond the <GPE>Hellespont</GPE> were left naked to the Turks; and their depredations verified the prophecy of a dying senator, that the recovery of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> would be the ruin of Asia.
 The victories of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> were achieved by his lieutenants; his sword rusted in the palace; and, in the transactions of the emperor with the popes and the king of Naples, his political acts were stained with cruelty and fraud.
 (28) His union with the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church, A.
D.
 1274-1277.
 I.
 The <FAC>Vatican</FAC> was the most natural refuge of a <NORP>Latin</NORP> emperor, who had been driven from his throne; and <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> Urban the <ORDINAL>Fourth</ORDINAL> appeared to pity the misfortunes, and vindicate the cause, of the fugitive Baldwin.
 A crusade, with plenary indulgence, was preached by his command against the schismatic Greeks: he excommunicated their allies and adherents; solicited <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Ninth</ORDINAL> in favour of his kinsman; and demanded a tenth of the ecclesiastical revenues of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>England</GPE> for the service of the holy war.
 (29) The subtle Greek, who watched the rising tempest of the West, attempted to suspend or soothe the hostility of the pope, by suppliant embassies and respectful letters; but he insinuated that the establishment of peace must prepare the reconciliation and obedience of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> church.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> court could not be deceived by so gross an artifice; and <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was admonished, that the repentance of the son should precede the forgiveness of the father; and that faith (an ambiguous word) was the only basis of friendship and alliance.
 After a long and affected delay, the approach of danger, and the importunity of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Tenth, compelled him to enter on a more serious negotiation: he alleged the example of the great Vataces; and the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> clergy, who understood the intentions of their prince, were not alarmed by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of reconciliation and respect.
 But when he pressed the conclusion of the treaty, they strenuously declared, that the Latins, though not in name, were heretics in fact, and that they despised those strangers as the vilest and most despicable portion of the human race.
 (30) It was the task of the emperor to persuade, to corrupt, to intimidate the most popular ecclesiastics, to gain the vote of each individual, and alternately to urge the arguments of <NORP>Christian</NORP> charity and the public welfare.
 The texts of the fathers and the arms of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> were balanced in the theological and political scale; and without approving the addition to the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> creed, the most moderate were taught to confess, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile propositions of proceeding from the Father BY the Son, and of proceeding from the Father AND the Son, might be reduced to a safe and <NORP>Catholic</NORP> sense.
 (31) The supremacy of the pope was a doctrine more easy to conceive, but more painful to acknowledge: yet <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> represented to his monks and prelates, that they might submit to name the <NORP>Roman</NORP> bishop as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the patriarchs; and that their distance and discretion would guard the liberties of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> church from the mischievous consequences of the right of appeal.
 He protested that he would sacrifice his life and empire rather than yield the smallest point of orthodox faith or national independence; and this declaration was sealed and ratified by a golden bull.
 The patriarch <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> withdrew to a monastery, to resign or resume his throne, according to the event of the treaty: the letters of union and obedience were subscribed by the emperor, his son Andronicus, and <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> archbishops and metropolitans, with their respective synods; and the episcopal list was multiplied by many dioceses which were annihilated under the yoke of the infidels.
 An embassy was composed of some trusty ministers and prelates: they embarked for Italy, with rich ornaments and rare perfumes for the altar of St.
 Peter; and their secret orders authorized and recommended a boundless compliance.
 They were received in the general council of Lyons, by <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Tenth, at the head of five hundred bishops.
 (32) He embraced with tears his long-lost and repentant children; accepted the oath of the ambassadors, who abjured the schism in the name of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors; adorned the prelates with the ring and mitre; chanted in <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> and <NORP>Latin</NORP> the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> creed with the addition of filioque; and rejoiced in the union of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, which had been reserved for his reign.
 To consummate this pious work, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> deputies were speedily followed by the pope's nuncios; and their instruction discloses the policy of the Vatican, which could not be satisfied with the vain title of supremacy.
 After viewing the temper of the prince and people, they were enjoined to absolve the schismatic clergy, who should subscribe and swear their abjuration and obedience; to establish in all the churches the use of the perfect creed; to prepare the entrance of a cardinal legate, with the full powers and dignity of his office; and to instruct the emperor in the advantages which he might derive from the temporal protection of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 (33) His persecution of the Greeks, A.
D.
 1277-1282.
 But they found a country without a friend, a nation in which the names of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <ORG>Union</ORG> were pronounced with abhorrence.
 The patriarch <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> was indeed removed: his place was filled by Veccus, an ecclesiastic of learning and moderation; and the emperor was still urged by the same motives, to persevere in the same professions.
 But in his private language <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> affected to deplore the pride, and to blame the innovations, of the Latins; and while he debased his character by this double hypocrisy, he justified and punished the opposition of his subjects.
 By the joint suffrage of the new and the ancient Rome, a sentence of excommunication was pronounced against the obstinate schismatics; the censures of the church were executed by the sword of Michael; on the failure of persuasion, he tried the arguments of prison and exile, of whipping and mutilation; those touchstones, says an historian, of cowards and the brave.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Greeks</NORP> still reigned in Aetolia, Epirus, and Thessaly, with the appellation of despots: they had yielded to the sovereign of Constantinople, but they rejected the chains of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, and supported their refusal by successful arms.
 Under their protection, the fugitive monks and bishops assembled in hostile synods; and retorted the name of heretic with the galling addition of apostate: the prince of <PERSON>Trebizond</PERSON> was tempted to assume the forfeit title of emperor; and even the <NORP>Latins</NORP> of Negropont, Thebes, Athens, and the Morea, forgot the merits of the convert, to join, with open or clandestine aid, the enemies of Palaeologus.
 His favourite generals, of his own blood, and family, successively deserted, or betrayed, the sacrilegious trust.
 His sister Eulogia, a niece, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> female cousins, conspired against him; another niece, <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> queen of Bulgaria, negotiated his ruin with the sultan of Egypt; and, in the public eye, their treason was consecrated as the most sublime virtue.
 (34) To the pope's nuncios, who urged the consummation of the work, <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> exposed a naked recital of all that he had done and suffered for their sake.
 They were assured that the guilty sectaries, of both sexes and every rank, had been deprived of their honours, their fortunes, and their liberty; a spreading list of confiscation and punishment, which involved many persons, the dearest to the emperor, or the best deserving of his favour.
 They were conducted to the prison, to behold <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> princes of the royal blood chained in the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> corners, and shaking their fetters in an agony of grief and rage.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> of these captives were afterwards released; the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> by submission, the other by death: but the obstinacy of their <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> companions was chastised by the loss of their eyes; and the Greeks, the least adverse to the union, deplored that cruel and inauspicious tragedy.
 (35) Persecutors must expect the hatred of those whom they oppress; but they commonly find some consolation in the testimony of their conscience, the applause of their party, and, perhaps, the success of their undertaking.
 But the hypocrisy of Michael, which was prompted only by political motives, must have forced him to hate himself, to despise his followers, and to esteem and envy the rebel champions by whom he was detested and despised.
 While his violence was abhorred at Constantinople, at <GPE>Rome</GPE> his slowness was arraigned, and his sincerity suspected; till at length <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fourth</ORDINAL> excluded the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> emperor from the pale of a church, into which he was striving to reduce a schismatic people.
 The union dissolved, A.
D.
 1283.
 No sooner had the tyrant expired, than the union was dissolved, and abjured by unanimous consent; the churches were purified; the penitents were reconciled; and his son Andronicus, after weeping the sins and errors of his youth most piously denied his father the burial of a prince and a Christian.
 (36) <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> of <GPE>Anjou</GPE> subdues <GPE>Naples</GPE> and Sicily.
 A.
D.
 1266, February 26.
 II.
 In the distress of the Latins, the walls and towers of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had fallen to decay: they were restored and fortified by the policy of Michael, who deposited a plenteous store of corn and salt provisions, to sustain the siege which he might hourly expect from the resentment of the <NORP>Western</NORP> powers.
 Of these, the sovereign of the <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Sicilies</NORP> was the most formidable neighbour: but as long as they were possessed by Mainfroy, the bastard of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, his monarchy was the bulwark, rather than the annoyance, of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The usurper, though a brave and active prince, was sufficiently employed in the defence of his throne: his proscription by successive popes had separated <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> from the common cause of the Latins; and the forces that might have besieged <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> were detained in a crusade against the domestic enemy of Rome.
 The prize of her avenger, the crown of the <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> Sicilies, was won and worn by the brother of St Louis, by <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> count of <GPE>Anjou</GPE> and Provence, who led the chivalry of <GPE>France</GPE> on this holy expedition.
 (37) The disaffection of his <NORP>Christian</NORP> subjects compelled <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> to enlist a colony of <PRODUCT>Saracens</PRODUCT> whom his father had planted in Apulia; and this odious succour will explain the defiance of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> hero, who rejected all terms of accommodation.
 The armies met: and though I am ignorant of Mainfroy's doom in the other world, in this he lost his friends, his kingdom, and his life, in the bloody battle of Benevento.
 <GPE>Naples</GPE> and <GPE>Sicily</GPE> were immediately peopled with a warlike race of <NORP>French</NORP> nobles; and their aspiring leader embraced the future conquest of Africa, Greece, and Palestine.
 The most specious reasons might point his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms against the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire; and Palaeologus, diffident of his own strength, repeatedly appealed from the ambition of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> to the humanity of St.
 Louis, who still preserved a just ascendant over the mind of his ferocious brother.
 For a while the attention of that brother was confined at home by the invasion of Conradin, the last heir to the imperial house of Swabia; but the hapless boy sunk in the unequal conflict; and his execution on a public scaffold taught the rivals of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> to tremble for their heads as well as their dominions.
 A <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> respite was obtained by the last crusade of St.
 <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> to the <NORP>African</NORP> coast; and the double motive of interest and duty urged the king of <GPE>Naples</GPE> to assist, with his powers and his presence, the holy enterprise.
 Threatens the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> empire, A.
D.
 1270 etc.
 The death of St.
 <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> released him from the importunity of a virtuous censor: the king of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> confessed himself the tributary and vassal of the crown of Sicily; and the boldest of the <NORP>French</NORP> knights were free to enlist under his banner against the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> empire.
 A treaty and a marriage united his interest with the house of Courtenay; his daughter <PERSON>Beatrice</PERSON> was promised to Philip, son and heir of the emperor Baldwin; a pension of six hundred ounces of gold was allowed for his maintenance; and his generous father distributed among his aliens the kingdoms and provinces of the East, reserving only Constantinople, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day's journey round the city for the imperial domain.
 (38) In this perilous moment, <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> was the most eager to subscribe the creed, and implore the protection, of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, who assumed, with propriety and weight, the character of an angel of peace, the common father of the Christians.
 By his voice, the sword of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> was chained in the scabbard; and the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> ambassadors beheld him, in the pope's antechamber, biting his ivory sceptre in a transport of fury, and deeply resenting the refusal to enfranchise and consecrate his arms.
 He appears to have respected the disinterested mediation of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Tenth; but <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> was insensibly disgusted by the pride and partiality of <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the Third; and his attachment to his kindred, the <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> family, alienated the most strenuous champion from the service of the church.
 The hostile league against the Greeks, of <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> the <NORP>Latin</NORP> emperor, the king of the <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> Sicilies, and the republic of Venice, was ripened into execution; and the election of <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> the Fourth, a <NORP>French</NORP> pope, gave a sanction to the cause.
 Of the allies, <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> supplied his name; Martin, a bull of excommunication; the Venetians, a squadron of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> galleys; and the formidable powers of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> consisted of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> counts, ten thousand men at arms, a numerous body of infantry, and a fleet of more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred ships and transports.
 A distant day was appointed for assembling this mighty force in the harbour of Brindisi; and a previous attempt was risked with a detachment of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred knights, who invaded Albania, and besieged the fortress of Belgrade.
 Their defeat might amuse with a triumph the vanity of Constantinople; but the more sagacious Michael, despairing of his arms, depended on the effects of a conspiracy; on the secret workings of a rat, who gnawed the bowstring (39) of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> tyrant.
 <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> instigates the revolt of Sicily, A.
D.
 1280.
 Among the proscribed adherents of the house of Swabia, <PERSON>John</PERSON> of <PERSON>Procida</PERSON> forfeited a small island of that name in the Bay of Naples.
 His birth was noble, but his education was learned; and in the poverty of exile, he was relieved by the practice of physic, which he had studied in the school of Salerno.
 Fortune had left him nothing to lose, except life; and to despise life is the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> qualification of a rebel.
 <PERSON>Procida</PERSON> was endowed with the art of negotiation, to enforce his reasons and disguise his motives; and in his various transactions with nations and men, he could persuade each party that he labored solely for their interest.
 The new kingdoms of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> were afflicted by every species of fiscal and military oppression; (40) and the lives and fortunes of his <NORP>Italian</NORP> subjects were sacrificed to the greatness of their master and the licentiousness of his followers.
 The hatred of <GPE>Naples</GPE> was repressed by his presence; but the looser government of his vicegerents excited the contempt, as well as the aversion, of the Sicilians: the island was roused to a sense of freedom by the eloquence of Procida; and he displayed to every baron his private interest in the common cause.
 In the confidence of foreign aid, he successively visited the courts of the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> emperor, and of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> king of Arragon, (41) who possessed the maritime countries of <GPE>Valentia</GPE> and Catalonia.
 To the ambitious <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> a crown was presented, which he might justly claim by his marriage with the sister of Mainfroy, and by the dying voice of Conradin, who from the scaffold had cast a ring to his heir and avenger.
 <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> was easily persuaded to divert his enemy from a foreign war by a rebellion at home; and a <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> subsidy of twenty-five thousand ounces of gold was most profitably applied to arm a <NORP>Catalan</NORP> fleet, which sailed under a holy banner to the specious attack of the <PRODUCT>Saracens</PRODUCT> of Africa.
 In the disguise of a monk or beggar, the indefatigable missionary of revolt flew from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to Rome, and from <GPE>Sicily</GPE> to Saragossa: the treaty was sealed with the signet of <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> himself, the enemy of Charles; and his deed of gift transferred the fiefs of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> from the house of <GPE>Anjou</GPE> to that of Arragon.
 So widely diffused and so freely circulated, the secret was preserved above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years with impenetrable discretion; and each of the conspirators imbibed the maxim of Peter, who declared that he would cut off his left hand if it were conscious of the intentions of his right.
 The mine was prepared with deep and dangerous artifice; but it may be questioned, whether the instant explosion of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> were the effect of accident or design.
 The <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> Vespers.
 A.
D.
 1282, March 30.
 On the vigil of Easter, a procession of the disarmed citizens visited a church without the walls; and a noble damsel was rudely insulted by a <NORP>French</NORP> soldier.
 (42) The ravisher was instantly punished with death; and if the people was at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> scattered by a military force, their numbers and fury prevailed: the conspirators seized the opportunity; the flame spread over the island; and <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>French</NORP> were exterminated in a promiscuous massacre, which has obtained the name of the SICILIAN VESPERS.
 (43) From every city the banners of freedom and the church were displayed: the revolt was inspired by the presence or the soul of <PERSON>Procida</PERSON> and <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> of Arragon, who sailed from the <NORP>African</NORP> coast to Palermo, was saluted as the king and saviour of the isle.
 By the rebellion of a people on whom he had so long trampled with impunity, <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> was astonished and confounded; and in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> agony of grief and devotion, he was heard to exclaim, "O God! if thou hast decreed to humble me, grant me at least a gentle and gradual descent from the pinnacle of greatness!" His fleet and army, which already filled the seaports of Italy, were hastily recalled from the service of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> war; and the situation of <GPE>Messina</GPE> exposed that town to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> storm of his revenge.
 Feeble in themselves, and yet hopeless of foreign succour, the citizens would have repented, and submitted on the assurance of full pardon and their ancient privileges.
 But the pride of the monarch was already rekindled; and the most fervent entreaties of the legate could extort no more than a promise, that he would forgive the remainder, after a chosen list of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> hundred rebels had been yielded to his discretion.
 The despair of the <NORP>Messinese</NORP> renewed their courage: <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> of <GPE>Arragon</GPE> approached to their relief; (44) and his rival was driven back by the failure of provision and the terrors of the equinox to the <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> shore.
 Defeat of Charles, October 2.
 At the same moment, the <NORP>Catalan</NORP> admiral, the famous <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> de Loria, swept the channel with an invincible squadron: the <NORP>French</NORP> fleet, more numerous in transports than in galleys, was either burnt or destroyed; and the same blow assured the independence of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and the safety of the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> empire.
 A few days before his death, the emperor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> rejoiced in the fall of an enemy whom he hated and esteemed; and perhaps he might be content with the popular judgment, that had they not been matched with each other, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> must speedily have obeyed the same master.
 (45) From this disastrous moment, the life of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> was a series of misfortunes: his capital was insulted, his son was made prisoner, and he sunk into the grave without recovering the Isle of Sicily, which, after a war of twenty years, was finally severed from the throne of Naples, and transferred, as an independent kingdom, to a younger branch of the house of Arragon.
 (46) The service and war of the <NORP>Catalans</NORP> in the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> empire, A.
D.
1303-1307.
 I shall not, I trust, be accused of superstition; but I must remark that, even in this world, the natural order of events will sometimes afford the strong appearances of moral retribution.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> had saved his empire by involving the kingdoms of the <LOC>West</LOC> in rebellion and blood; and from these scenes of discord uprose a generation of iron men, who assaulted and endangered the empire of his son.
 In modern times our debts and taxes are the secret poison which still corrodes the bosom of peace: but in the weak and disorderly government of the middle ages, it was agitated by the present evil of the disbanded armies.
 Too idle to work, too proud to beg, the mercenaries were accustomed to a life of rapine: they could rob with more dignity and effect under a banner and a chief; and the sovereign, to whom their service was useless, and their presence importunate, endeavoured to discharge the torrent on some neighbouring countries.
 After the peace of Sicily, many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of Genoese, Catalans, (47) etc.
, who had fought, by sea and land, under the standard of <GPE>Anjou</GPE> or Arragon, were blended into <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> nation by the resemblance of their manners and interest.
 They heard that the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> were invaded by the Turks: they resolved to share the harvest of pay and plunder: and <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> most liberally contributed the means of their departure.
 In a warfare of twenty years, a ship, or a camp, was become their country; arms were their sole profession and property; valour was the only virtue which they knew; their women had imbibed the fearless temper of their lovers and husbands: it was reported, that, with a stroke of their broadsword, the <NORP>Catalans</NORP> could cleave a horseman and a horse; and the report itself was a powerful weapon.
 <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> de Flor was the most popular of their chiefs; and his personal merit overshadowed the dignity of his prouder rivals of Arragon.
 The offspring of a marriage between a <NORP>German</NORP> gentleman of the court of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> and a damsel of Brindisi, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was successively a templar, an apostate, a pirate, and at length the richest and most powerful admiral of the Mediterranean.
 He sailed from <GPE>Messina</GPE> to Constantinople, with <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> galleys, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> great ships, and <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> thousand adventurers; and his previous treaty was faithfully accomplished by <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> the elder, who accepted with joy and terror this formidable succour.
 A palace was allotted for his reception, and a niece of the emperor was given in marriage to the valiant stranger, who was immediately created great duke or admiral of Romania.
 After a decent repose, he transported his troops over the Propontis, and boldly led them against the Turks: in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bloody battles <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were slain: he raised the siege of Philadelphia, and deserved the name of the deliverer of Asia.
 But after a short season of prosperity, the cloud of slavery and ruin again burst on that unhappy province.
 The inhabitants escaped (says a <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> historian) from the smoke into the flames; and the hostility of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> was less pernicious than the friendship of the Catalans.
 The lives and fortunes which they had rescued they considered as their own: the willing or reluctant maid was saved from the race of circumcision for the embraces of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> soldier: the exaction of fines and supplies was enforced by licentious rapine and arbitrary executions; and, on the resistance of Magnesia, the great duke besieged a city of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (48) These disorders he excused by the wrongs and passions of a victorious army; nor would his own authority or person have been safe, had he dared to punish his faithful followers, who were defrauded of the just and covenanted price of their services.
 The threats and complaints of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> disclosed the nakedness of the empire.
 His golden bull had invited no more than five hundred horse and a thousand foot soldiers; yet the crowds of volunteers, who migrated to the East, had been enlisted and fed by his spontaneous bounty.
 While his bravest allies were content with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> byzants or pieces of gold, for their <DATE>monthly</DATE> pay, an ounce, or even <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ounces, of gold were assigned to the Catalans, whose <DATE>annual</DATE> pension would thus amount to near a hundred pounds sterling: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their chiefs had modestly rated at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred thousand crowns the value of his future merits; and above a million had been issued from the treasury for the maintenance of these costly mercenaries.
 A cruel tax had been imposed on the corn of the husbandman: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> was retrenched from the salaries of the public officers; and the standard of the coin was so shamefully debased, that of the four-and-twenty parts only five were of pure gold.
 (49) At the summons of the emperor, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> evacuated a province which no longer supplied the materials of rapine; but he refused to disperse his troops; and while his style was respectful, his conduct was independent and hostile.
 He protested, that if the emperor should march against him, he would advance <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> paces to kiss the ground before him; but in rising from this prostrate attitude <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> had a life and sword at the service of his friends.
 The great duke of <GPE>Romania</GPE> condescended to accept the title and ornaments of Caesar; but he rejected the new proposal of the government of <LOC>Asia</LOC> with a subsidy of corn and money, on condition that he should reduce his troops to the harmless number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 Assassination is the last resource of cowards.
 The <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> was tempted to visit the royal residence of Adrianople; in the apartment, and before the eyes, of the empress he was stabbed by the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> guards; and though the deed was imputed to their private revenge, his countrymen, who dwelt at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> in the security of peace, were involved in the same proscription by the prince or people.
 The loss of their leader intimidated the crowd of adventurers, who hoisted the sails of flight, and were soon scattered round the coasts of the Mediterranean.
 But a veteran band of fifteen hundred Catalans, or French, stood firm in the strong fortress of <GPE>Gallipoli</GPE> on the Hellespont, displayed the banners of Arragon, and offered to revenge and justify their chief, by an equal combat of ten or a hundred warriors.
 Instead of accepting this bold defiance, the emperor Michael, the son and colleague of Andronicus, resolved to oppress them with the weight of multitudes: every nerve was strained to form an army of thirteen thousand horse and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot; and the <PRODUCT>Propontis</PRODUCT> was covered with the ships of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Genoese.
 In <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles by sea and land, these mighty forces were encountered and overthrown by the despair and discipline of the Catalans: the young emperor fled to the palace; and an insufficient guard of light-horse was left for the protection of the open country.
 Victory renewed the hopes and numbers of the adventures: every nation was blended under the name and standard of the great company; and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turkish</NORP> proselytes deserted from the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> service to join this military association.
 In the possession of Gallipoli, the <NORP>Catalans</NORP> intercepted the trade of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the Black Sea, while they spread their devastation on either side of the <GPE>Hellespont</GPE> over the confines of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia.
 To prevent their approach, the greatest part of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> territory was laid waste by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> themselves: the peasants and their cattle retired into the city; and myriads of sheep and oxen, for which neither place nor food could be procured, were unprofitably slaughtered on the same day.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> times the emperor <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> sued for peace, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> times he was inflexibly repulsed, till the want of provisions, and the discord of the chiefs, compelled the <NORP>Catalans</NORP> to evacuate the banks of the <GPE>Hellespont</GPE> and the neighbourhood of the capital.
 After their separation from the Turks, the remains of the great company pursued their march through <GPE>Macedonia</GPE> and Thessaly, to seek a new establishment in the heart of Greece.
 (50) Revolutions of Athens.
 A.
D.
 1204-1456.
 After some ages of oblivion, <GPE>Greece</GPE> was awakened to new misfortunes by the arms of the Latins.
 In the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and the last conquest of Constantinople, that venerable land was disputed by a multitude of petty tyrants; without the comforts of freedom and genius, her ancient cities were again plunged in foreign and intestine war; and, if servitude be preferable to anarchy, they might repose with joy under the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> yoke.
 I shall not pursue the obscure and various dynasties, that rose and fell on the continent or in the isles; but our silence on the fate of ATHENS (51) would argue a strange ingratitude to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and purest school of liberal science and amusement.
 In the partition of the empire, the principality of <GPE>Athens</GPE> and <GPE>Thebes</GPE> was assigned to <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> de la Roche, a noble warrior of Burgundy, (52) with the title of great duke, (53) which the <NORP>Latins</NORP> understood in their own sense, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> more foolishly derived from the age of Constantine.
 (54) <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> followed the standard of the marquis of Montferrat: the ample state which he acquired by a miracle of conduct or fortune, (55) was peaceably inherited by his son and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> grandsons, till the family, though not the nation, was changed, by the marriage of an heiress into the elder branch of the house of Brienne.
 The son of that marriage, Walter de Brienne, succeeded to the duchy of Athens; and, with the aid of some <NORP>Catalan</NORP> mercenaries, whom he invested with fiefs, reduced above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> castles of the vassal or neighbouring lords.
 But when he was informed of the approach and ambition of the great company, he collected a force of seven hundred knights, six thousand <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred horse, and <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> thousand foot, and boldly met them on the banks of the River Cephisus in Boeotia.
 The <NORP>Catalans</NORP> amounted to no more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand five hundred horse, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand foot; but the deficiency of numbers was compensated by stratagem and order.
 They formed round their camp an artificial inundation; the duke and his knights advanced without fear or precaution on the verdant meadow; their horses plunged into the bog; and he was cut in pieces, with the greatest part of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry.
 His family and nation were expelled; and his son Walter de Brienne, the titular duke of Athens, the tyrant of Florence, and the constable of France, lost his life in the field of Poitiers <GPE>Attica</GPE> and <PERSON>Boeotia</PERSON> were the rewards of the victorious Catalans; they married the widows and daughters of the slain; and during fourteen years, the great company was the terror of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> states.
 Their factions drove them to acknowledge the sovereignty of the house of Arragon; and during the remainder of the fourteenth century, Athens, as a government or an appanage, was successively bestowed by the kings of Sicily.
 After the <NORP>French</NORP> and Catalans, the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> dynasty was that of the Accaioli, a family, plebeian at Florence, potent at Naples, and sovereign in Greece.
 Athens, which they embellished with new buildings, became the capital of a state, that extended over Thebes, Argos, Corinth, Delphi, and a part of Thessaly; and their reign was finally determined by <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> the Second, who strangled the last duke, and educated his sons in the discipline and religion of the seraglio.
 Present state of Athens.
 Athens, (56) though no more than the shadow of her former self, still contains about <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> or ten thousand inhabitants; of these, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> fourths are <NORP>Greeks</NORP> in religion and language; and the Turks, who compose the remainder, have relaxed, in their intercourse with the citizens, somewhat of the pride and gravity of their national character.
 The olive-tree, the gift of Minerva, flourishes in Attica; nor has the honey of Mount Hymettus lost any part of its exquisite flavour: (57) but the languid trade is monopolized by strangers, and the agriculture of a barren land is abandoned to the vagrant Walachians.
 The <NORP>Athenians</NORP> are still distinguished by the subtlety and acuteness of their understandings; but these qualities, unless ennobled by freedom, and enlightened by study, will degenerate into a low and selfish cunning: and it is a proverbial saying of the country, "From the <NORP>Jews</NORP> of Thessalonica, the <NORP>Turks</NORP> of Negropont, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> of Athens, good Lord deliver us!" This artful people has eluded the tyranny of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> bashaws, by an expedient which alleviates their servitude and aggravates their shame.
 About the middle of the last century, the <NORP>Athenians</NORP> chose for their protector the Kislar Aga, or chief black eunuch of the seraglio.
 This <NORP>Aethiopian</NORP> slave, who possesses the sultan's ear, condescends to accept the tribute of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand crowns: his lieutenant, the Waywode, whom he annually confirms, may reserve for his own about five or six thousand more; and such is the policy of the citizens, that they seldom fail to remove and punish an oppressive governor.
 Their private differences are decided by the archbishop, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the richest prelates of the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> church, since he possesses a revenue of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand pounds sterling; and by a tribunal of the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> geronti or elders, chosen in the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> quarters of the city: the noble families cannot trace their pedigree above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred years; but their principal members are distinguished by a grave demeanour, a fur cap, and the lofty appellation of archon.
 By some, who delight in the contrast, the modern language of <GPE>Athens</GPE> is represented as the most corrupt and barbarous of the <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> dialects of the vulgar Greek: (58) this picture is too darkly coloured: but it would not be easy, in the country of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> and Demosthenes, to find a reader or a copy of their works.
 The <NORP>Athenians</NORP> walk with supine indifference among the glorious ruins of antiquity; and such is the debasement of their character, that they are incapable of admiring the genius of their predecessors.
