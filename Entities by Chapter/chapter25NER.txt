 363.
 THE death of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had left the public affairs of the empire in a very doubtful and dangerous situation.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> army was saved by an inglorious, perhaps a necessary, treaty;(1) and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> moments of peace were consecrated by the pious <NORP>Jovian</NORP> to restore the domestic tranquillity of the church and state.
 The indiscretion of his predecessor, instead of reconciling, had artfully fomented the religious war; and the balance which he affected to preserve between the hostile factions served only to perpetuate the contest by the vicissitudes of hope and fear, by the rival claims of ancient possession and actual favour.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> had forgotten the spirit of the Gospel, and the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> had imbibed the spirit of the church.
 In private families the sentiments of nature were extinguished by the blind fury of zeal and revenge; the majesty of the laws was violated or abused; the cities of the <LOC>East</LOC> were stained with blood; and the most implacable enemies of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were in the bosom of their country.
 <NORP>Jovian</NORP> was educated in the profession of Christianity; and as he marched from <PERSON>Nisibis</PERSON> to Antioch, the banner of the Cross, the LABARUM of Constantine, which was again displayed at the head of the legions, announced to the people the faith of their new emperor.
 As soon as he ascended the throne he transmitted a circular epistle to all the governors of provinces, in which he confessed the divine truth and secured the legal establishment of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion.
 The insidious edicts of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were abolished, the ecclesiastical immunities were restored and enlarged, and <NORP>Jovian</NORP> condescended to lament that the distress of the times obliged him to diminish the measure of charitable distributions.
(2) The <NORP>Christians</NORP> were unanimous in the loud and sincere applause which they bestowed on the pious successor of Julian; but they were still ignorant what creed or what synod he would choose for the standard of orthodoxy, and the peace of the church immediately revived those eager disputes which had been suspended during the season of persecution.
 The episcopal leaders of the contending sects, convinced from experience how much their fate would depend on the earliest impressions that were made on the mind of an untutored soldier, hastened to the court of Edessa, or Antioch.
 The highways of the <LOC>East</LOC> were crowded with Homoousian, and Arian, and Semi-Arian, and <NORP>Eunomian</NORP> bishops, who struggled to outstrip each other in the holy race; the apartments of the palace resounded with their clamours, and the ears of the prince were assaulted, and perhaps astonished, by the singular mixture of metaphysical argument and passionate invective.
 (3) The moderation of Jovian, who recommended concord and charity, and referred the disputants to the sentence of a future council, was interpreted as a symptom of indifference; but his attachment to the Nicene Creed was at length discovered and declared by the reverence which he expressed for the celestial (4) virtues of the great Athanasius.
 The intrepid veteran of the faith, at the age of seventy, had issued from his retreat on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of the tyrant's death.
 The acclamations of the people seated him once more on the archiepiscopal throne, and he wisely accepted or anticipated the invitation of Jovian.
 The venerable figure of Athanasius, his calm courage and insinuating eloquence, sustained the reputation which he had already acquired in the courts of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> successive princes.
(5) As soon as he had gained the confidence and secured the faith of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperor, he returned in triumph to his diocese, and continued, with mature counsels and undiminished vigour, to direct, <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years longer,(6) the ecclesiastical government of Alexandria, Egypt, and the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 Before his departure from Antioch, he assured <NORP>Jovian</NORP> that his orthodox devotion would be rewarded with a long and peaceful reign.
 <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> had reason to hope that he should be allowed either the merit of a successful prediction, or the excuse of a grateful though ineffectual prayer.
(7) <NORP>Jovian</NORP> proclaims universal toleration.
 The slightest force, when it is applied to assist and guide the natural descent of its object, operates with irresistible weight; and <NORP>Jovian</NORP> had the good fortune to embrace the religious opinions which were supported by the spirit of the times, and the zeal and numbers of the most powerful sect.
(8) Under his reign <NORP>Christianity</NORP> obtained an easy and lasting victory; and as soon as the smile of royal patronage was withdrawn, the genius of Paganism, which had been fondly raised and cherished by the arts of Julian, sunk irrecoverably in the dust.
 In many cities the temples were shut or deserted; the philosophers, who had abused their transient favour, thought it prudent to shave their beards and disguise their profession; and the <NORP>Christians</NORP> rejoiced that they were now in a condition to forgive or to revenge the injuries which they had suffered under the preceding reign.
(9) The consternation of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> world was dispelled by a wise and gracious edict of toleration, in which <NORP>Jovian</NORP> explicitly declared that, although he should severely punish the sacrilegious rites of magic, his subjects might exercise, with freedom and safety, the ceremonies of the ancient worship.
 The memory of this law has been preserved by the orator Themistius, who was deputed by the senate of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to express their loyal devotion for the new emperor.
 <PERSON>Themistius</PERSON> expatiates on the clemency of the Divine Nature, the facility of human error, the rights of conscience, and the independence of the mind, and, with some eloquence, inculcates the principles of philosophical toleration, whose aid Superstition herself, in the hour of her distress, is not ashamed to implore.
 He justly observes that in the recent changes both religions had been alternately disgraced by the seeming acquisition of worthless proselytes, of those votaries of the reigning purple who could pass, without a reason and without a blush, from the church to the temple, and from the altars of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> to the sacred table of the Christians.
(10) His progress from Antioch.
 A.
D.
 363, <DATE>October</DATE> In the space of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops, who were now returned to Antioch, had performed a march of fifteen hundred miles, in which they had endured all the hardships of war, of famine, and of climate.
 Notwithstanding their services, their fatigues, and the approach of winter, the timid and impatient <NORP>Jovian</NORP> allowed only to the men and horses a respite of six weeks.
 The emperor could not sustain the indiscreet and malicious raillery of the people of Antioch.
(11) He was impatient to possess the palace of Constantinople, and to prevent the ambition of some competitor who might occupy the vacant allegiance of Europe; but he soon received the grateful intelligence that his authority was acknowledged from the Thracian <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> to the <LOC>Atlantic</LOC> ocean.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> letters which he despatched from the camp of Mesopotamia, he had delegated the military command of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <NORP>Illyricum</NORP> to Malarich, a brave and faithful officer of the nation of the Franks, and to his father-in-law, Count Lucillian, who had formerly distinguished his courage and conduct in the defence of Nisibis.
 <PERSON>Malarich</PERSON> had declined an office to which he thought himself unequal, and <PERSON>Lucillian</PERSON> was massacred at Rheims, in an accidental mutiny of the <NORP>Batavian</NORP> cohorts.
(12) But the moderation of Jovinus, master-general of the cavalry, who forgave the intention of his disgrace, soon appeased the tumult and confirmed the uncertain minds of the soldiers.
 The oath of fidelity was administered and taken with loyal acclamations, and the deputies of the <NORP>Western</NORP> armies(13) saluted their new sovereign as he descended from Mount Taurus to the city of Tyana, in Cappadocia.
 From <GPE>Tyana</GPE> he continued his hasty march to Ancyra, capital of the province of Galatia, A.

 where <NORP>Jovian</NORP> assumed, with his infant son, the name and ensigns of the consulship.
 (14) Dadastana,(15) an obscure town, almost at an equal distance between <PERSON>Ancyra</PERSON> and Nice, was marked for the fatal term of his journey and his life.
Death of Jovian, February 17.
 After indulging himself with a plentiful, perhaps an intemperate supper, he retired to rest, and the next morning the emperor <NORP>Jovian</NORP> was found dead in his bed.
 The cause of this sudden death was variously understood.
 By some it was ascribed to the consequences of an indigestion, occasioned either by the quantity of the wine or the quality of the mushrooms which he had swallowed in the evening.
 According to others, he was suffocated in his sleep by the vapour of charcoal, which extracted from the walls of the apartment the unwholesome moisture of the fresh plaster.
(16) But the want of a regular inquiry into the death of a prince whose reign and person were soon forgotten appears to have been the only circumstance which countenanced the malicious whispers of poison and domestic guilt.
(17) The body of <NORP>Jovian</NORP> was sent to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to be interred with his predecessors, and the sad procession was met on the road by his wife Charito, the daughter of Count Lucillian, who still wept the recent death of her father, and was hastening to dry her tears in the embraces of an <NORP>Imperial</NORP> husband.
 Her disappointment and grief were embittered by the anxiety of maternal tenderness.
 Six weeks before the death of Jovian, his infant son had been placed in the curule chair, adorned with the title of <WORK_OF_ART>Nobilissimus</WORK_OF_ART> and the vain ensigns of the consulship.
 Unconscious of his fortune, the royal youth, who from his grandfather assumed the name of Varronian, was reminded only by the jealousy of the government that he was the son of an emperor.
 Sixteen years afterwards he was still alive; but he had already been deprived of an eye, and his afflicted mother expected, every hour, that the innocent victim would be torn from her arms, to appease with his blood the suspicions of the reigning prince.
(18) Vacancy of the throne.
 Feb.
 17-26.
 After the death of <NORP>Jovian</NORP> the throne of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world remained <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days (19) without a master.
 The ministers and generals still continued to meet in council, to exercise their respective functions, to maintain the public order, and peaceably to conduct the army to the city of <GPE>Nice</GPE> in Bithynia, which was chosen for the place of the election.
(20) In a solemn assembly of the civil and military powers of the empire, the diadem was again unanimously offered to the praefect Sallust.
 He enjoyed the glory of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> refusal; and, when the virtues of the father were alleged in favour of the son, the praefect, with the firmness of a disinterested patriot, declared to the electors that the feeble age of the one, and the inexperienced youth of the other, were equally incapable of the laborious duties of government.
 Several candidates were proposed, and, after weighing the objections of character or situation, they were successively rejected: Election and character of Valentinian.
 but as soon as the name of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was pronounced, the merit of that officer united the suffrages of the whole assembly, and obtained the sincere approbation of <PERSON>Sallust</PERSON> himself.
 Valentinian(21) was the son of Count Gratian, a native of Cibalis, in Pannonia, who from an obscure condition had raised himself, by matchless strength and dexterity, to the military commands of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Britain, from which he retired with an ample fortune and suspicious integrity.
 The rank and services of <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> contributed, however, to smooth the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the promotion of his son, and afforded him an early opportunity of displaying those solid and useful qualifications which raised his character above the ordinary level of his fellow-soldiers.
 The person of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was tall, graceful, and majestic.
 His manly countenance, deeply marked with the impression of sense and spirit, inspired his friends with awe, and his enemies with fear; and, to <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> the efforts of his undaunted courage, the son of <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> had inherited the advantages of a strong and healthy constitution.
 By the habits of chastity and temperance, which restrain the appetites and invigorate the faculties, <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> preserved his own and the public esteem.
 The avocations of a military life had diverted his youth from the elegant pursuits of literature; he was ignorant of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and the arts of rhetoric; but, as the mind of the orator was never disconcerted by timid perplexity, he was able, as often as the occasion prompted him, to deliver his decided sentiments with bold and ready elocution.
 The laws of martial discipline were the only laws that he had studied, and he was soon distinguished by the laborious diligence and inflexible severity with which he discharged and enforced the duties of the camp.
 In the time of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> he provoked the danger of disgrace by the contempt which he publicly expressed for the reigning religion; (22) and it should seem, from his subsequent conduct, that the indiscreet and unseasonable freedom of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was the effect of military spirit rather than of <NORP>Christian</NORP> zeal.
 He was pardoned, however, and still employed by a prince who esteemed his merit, (23) and in the various events of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war he improved the reputation which he had already acquired on the banks of the Rhine.
 The celerity and success with which he executed an important commission recommended him to the favour of Jovian, and to the honourable command of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> school, or company, of <ORG>Targeteers</ORG> of the domestic guards.
 In the march from <GPE>Antioch</GPE> he had reached his quarters at Ancyra, when he was unexpectedly summoned, without guilt and without intrigue, to assume, in the forty-third year of his age, the absolute government of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 He is acknowledged by the army, A.
D.
 364.
 February 26.
 The invitation of the ministers and generals at <GPE>Nice</GPE> was of little moment, unless it were confirmed by the voice of the army.
 The aged Sallust, who had long observed the irregular fluctuations of popular assemblies, proposed, under pain of death, that none of those persons whose rank in the service might excite a party in their favour, should appear in public on the day of the inauguration Yet such was the prevalence of ancient superstition, that a whole day was voluntarily added to this dangerous interval because it happened to be the intercalation of the Bissextile.
(24) At length, when the hour was supposed to be propitious, <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> showed himself from a lofty tribunal; the judicious choice was applauded, and the new prince was solemnly invested with the diadem and the purple, amidst the acclamations of the troops, who were disposed in martial order round the tribunal.
 But when he stretched forth his hand to address the armed multitude, a busy whisper was accidentally started in the ranks, and insensibly swelled into a loud and imperious clamour, that he should name, without delay, a colleague in the empire.
 The intrepid calmness of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> obtained silence and commanded respect, and he thus addressed the assembly: The astonished troops, with a mixture of pride, of satisfaction, and of terror, confessed the voice of their master.
 Their angry clamours subsided into silent reverence, and Valentinian, encompassed with the eagles of the legions and the various banners of the cavalry and infantry, was conducted in warlike pomp to the palace of Nice.
 As he was sensible, however, of the importance of preventing some rash declaration of the soldiers, he consulted the assembly of the chiefs and their real sentiments were concisely expressed by the generous freedom of Dagalaiphus.
 The emperor, who suppressed his displeasure without altering his intention, slowly proceeded from <GPE>Nice</GPE> to Nicomedia and Constantinople.

 March <CARDINAL>28</CARDINAL> In <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of that capital, (27) thirty days after his own elevation, he bestowed the title of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> on his brother Valens: and as the boldest patriots were convinced that their opposition, without being serviceable to their country, would be fatal to themselves, the declaration of his absolute will was received with silent submission.
 <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> was now in the thirty-sixth year of his age, but his abilities had never been exercised in any employment, military or civil, and his character had not inspired the world with any sanguine expectations.
 He possessed, however, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> quality which recommended him to Valentinian, and preserved the domestic peace of the empire: a devout and grateful attachment to his benefactor, whose superiority of genius, as well as of authority, <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> humbly and cheerfully acknowledged in every action of his life.
(28) The final division of the eastern and western empires.
 A.
D.

 June.
 Before <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> divided the provinces, he reformed the administration of the empire.
 All ranks of subjects who had been injured or oppressed under the reign of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were invited to support their public accusations.
 The silence of mankind attested the spotless integrity of the praefect Sallust,(29) and his own pressing solicitations that he might be permitted to retire from the business of the state were rejected by <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> with the most honourable expressions of friendship and esteem.
 But among the favourites of the late emperor there were many who had abused his credulity or superstition, and who could no longer hope to be protected either by favour or justice.
 (30) The greater part of the ministers of the palace and the governors of the provinces were removed from their respective stations, yet the eminent merit of some officers was distinguished from the obnoxious crowd, and, notwithstanding the opposite clamours of zeal and resentment, the whole proceedings of this delicate inquiry appear to have been conducted with a reasonable share of wisdom and moderation.
 (31) The festivity of a new reign received a short and suspicious interruption from the sudden illness of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes, but as soon as their health was restored they left <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> in the beginning of the spring.
 In the castle or palace of Mediana, only <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles from Naissus, they executed the solemn and final division of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
(32) <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> bestowed on his brother the rich praefecture of the East, from the Lower <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the confines of Persia; whilst he reserved for his immediate government the warlike praefectures of Illyricum, Italy, and Gaul, from the extremity of <GPE>Greece</GPE> to the <NORP>Caledonian</NORP> rampart and from the rampart of <GPE>Caledonia</GPE> to the foot of Mount Atlas.
 The provincial administration remained on its former basis, but a double supply of generals and magistrates was required for <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> councils and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> courts; the division was made with a just regard to their peculiar merit and situation, and <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> master-generals were soon created either of the cavalry or infantry.
 When this important business had been amicably transacted, <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> and <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> embraced for the last time.
 The emperor of the <LOC>West</LOC> established his temporary residence at Milan, and the emperor of the <LOC>East</LOC> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to assume the dominion of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> provinces, of whose language he was totally ignorant.
(33) Revolt of Procopius.
 A.
D.
 365.
 September 28.
 The tranquillity of the <LOC>East</LOC> was soon disturbed by rebellion and the throne of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> was threatened by the daring attempts of a rival whose affinity to the emperor Julian(34) was his sole merit, and had been his only crime.
 <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> had been hastily promoted from the obscure station of a tribune and a notary to the joint command of the army of Mesopotamia; the public opinion already named him as the successor of a prince who was destitute of natural heirs; and a vain rumour was propagated by his friends or his enemies, that Julian, before the altar of the <LOC>Moon</LOC> at Carrhae, had privately invested <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple.
(35) He endeavoured, by his dutiful and submissive behaviour, to disarm the jealousy of Jovian, resigned without a contest his military command, and retired, with his wife and family, to cultivate the ample patrimony which he possessed in the province of Cappadocia.
 These useful and innocent occupations were interrupted by the appearance of an officer with a band of soldiers, who, in the name of his new sovereigns, <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> and Valens, was despatched to conduct the unfortunate <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> either to a perpetual prison or an ignominious death.
 His presence of mind procured him a longer respite and a more splendid fate.
 Without presuming to dispute the royal mandate, he requested the indulgence of a few moments to embrace his weeping family, and, while the vigilance of his guards was relaxed by a plentiful entertainment, he dexterously escaped to the seacoast of the Euxine, from whence he passed over the country of Bosphorus.
 In that sequestered region he remained many months, exposed to the hardships of exile, of solitude, and of want; his melancholy temper brooding over his misfortune, and his mind agitated by the just apprehension that, if any accident should discover his name, the faithless barbarians would violate, without much scruple, the laws of hospitality.
 In a moment of impatience and despair, <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> embarked in a merchant-vessel which made sail for Constantinople, and boldly aspired to the rank of a sovereign because he was not allowed to enjoy the security of a subject.
 At <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> he lurked in the villages of Bithynia, continually changing his habitation and his disguise.
 (36) By degrees he ventured into the capital, trusted his life and fortune to the fidelity of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> friends, a senator and an eunuch, and conceived some hopes of success from the intelligence which he obtained of the actual state of public affairs.
 The body of the people was infected with a spirit of discontent: they regretted the justice and the abilities of Sallust, who had been imprudently dismissed from the praefecture of the East.
 They despised the character of Valens, which was rude without vigour, and feeble without mildness.
 They dreaded the influence of his father-in-law, the patrician Petronius, a cruel and rapacious minister, who rigorously exacted all the arrears of tribute that might remain unpaid since the reign of the emperor Aurelian.
 The circumstances were propitious to the designs of an usurper.
 The hostile measures of the <NORP>Persians</NORP> required the presence of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> in Syria; from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> the troops were in motion, and the capital was occasionally filled with the soldiers who passed or repassed the Thracian Bosphorus.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> cohorts of <NORP>Gauls</NORP> were persuaded to listen to the secret proposals of the conspirators, which were recommended by the promise of a liberal donative; and as they still revered the memory of Julian, they easily consented to support the hereditary claim of his proscribed kinsman.
 At the dawn of day they were drawn up near the baths of Anastasia, and Procopius, clothed in a purple garment more suitable to a player than to a monarch, appeared, as if he rose from the dead, in the midst of Constantinople.
 The soldiers, who were prepared for his reception, saluted their trembling prince with shouts of joy and vows of fidelity.
 Their numbers were soon increased by a sturdy band of peasants collected from the adjacent country, and Procopius, shielded by the arms of his adherents, was successively conducted to the tribunal, the senate, and the palace.
 During the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> moments of his tumultuous reign he was astonished and terrified by the gloomy silence of the people, who were either ignorant of the cause or apprehensive of the event.
 But his military strength was superior to any actual resistance; the malcontents flocked to the standard of rebellion; the poor were excited by the hopes, and the rich were intimidated by the fear, of a general pillage; and the obstinate credulity of the multitude was once more deceived by the promised advantages of a revolution.
 The magistrates were seized, the prisons and arsenals broke open, the gates and the entrance of the harbour were diligently occupied, and, in a few hours, <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> became the absolute, though precarious, master of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The usurper improved this unexpected success with some degree of courage and dexterity.
 He artfully propagated the rumours and opinions the most favourable to his interest, while he deluded the populace by giving audience to the frequent but imaginary ambassadors of distant nations.
 The large bodies of troops stationed in the cities of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and the fortresses of the Lower <LOC>Danube</LOC> were gradually involved in the guilt of rebellion, and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> princes consented to supply the sovereign of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the formidable strength of several thousand auxiliaries.
 His generals passed the Bosphorus, and subdued, without an effort, the unarmed but wealthy provinces of <GPE>Bithynia</GPE> and Asia.
 After an honourable defence the city and island of <GPE>Cyzicus</GPE> yielded to his power, the renowned legions of the <NORP>Jovians</NORP> and <NORP>Herculians</NORP> embraced the cause of the usurper whom they were ordered to crush, and, as the veterans were continually augmented with new levies, he soon appeared at the head of an army whose valour, as well as numbers, were not unequal to the greatness of the contest.
 The son of Hormisdas, (37) a youth of spirit and ability, condescended to draw his sword against the lawful emperor of the East, and the <NORP>Persian</NORP> prince was immediately invested with the ancient and extraordinary powers of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> proconsul.
 The alliance of Faustina, the widow of the emperor Constantius, who intrusted herself and her daughter to the hands of the usurper, added dignity and reputation to his cause.
 The princess Constantia, who was then about <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years of age, accompanied, in a litter, the monarch of the army.
 She was shown to the multitude in the arms of her adopted father, and, as often as she passed through the ranks, the tenderness of the soldiers was inflamed into martial fury:(38) They recollected the glories of the house of Constantine, and they declared, with loyal acclamation, that they would shed the last drop of their blood in the defence of the royal infant.
(39) His defeat and death, A.
D.
 366.
 May <CARDINAL>28</CARDINAL> In the meanwhile <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was alarmed and perplexed by the doubtful intelligence of the revolt of the East.
 The difficulties of a <NORP>German</NORP> war forced him to confine his immediate care to the safety of his own dominions; and, as every channel of communication was stopped or corrupted, he listened, with doubtful anxiety, to the rumours which were industriously spread that the defeat and death of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> had left <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> sole master of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> provinces.
 <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> was not dead but on the news of the rebellion, which he received at Casarea, he basely despaired of his life and fortune, proposed to negotiate with the usurper, and discovered his secret inclination to abdicate the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple.
 The timid monarch was saved from disgrace and ruin by the firmness of his ministers, and their abilities soon decided in his favour the event of the civil war.
 In a season of tranquillity <PERSON>Sallust</PERSON> had resigned without a murmur, but, as soon as the public safety was attacked, he ambitiously solicited the pre-eminence of toil and danger, and the restoration of that virtuous minister to the praefecture of the <LOC>East</LOC> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> step which indicated the repentance of Valens, and satisfied the minds of the people.
 The reign of <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> was apparently supported by powerful armies and obedient provinces.
 But many of the principal officers, military as well as civil, had been urged, either by motives of duty or interest, to withdraw themselves from the guilty scene, or to watch the moment of betraying and deserting the cause of the usurper.
 Lupicinus advanced by hasty marches to bring the legions of <GPE>Syria</GPE> to the aid of Valens.
 Arintheus, who in strength, beauty, and valour excelled all the heroes of the age, attacked with a small troop a superior body of the rebels.
 When he beheld the faces of the soldiers who had served under his banner, he commanded them, with a loud voice, to seize and deliver up their pretended leader, and such was the ascendant of his genius that this extraordinary order was instantly obeyed.
 (40) Arbetio, a respectable veteran of the great Constantine, who had been distinguished by the honours of the consulship, was persuaded to leave his retirement, and once more to conduct an army into the field.
 In the heat of action, calmly taking off his helmet, he showed his grey hairs and venerable countenance, saluted the soldiers of <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> by the endearing names of children and companions, and exhorted them no longer to support the desperate cause of a contemptible tyrant, but to follow their old commander, who had so often led them to honour and victory.
 In the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> engagements of <PERSON>Thyatira</PERSON> (41) and <PERSON>Nacolia</PERSON> the unfortunate <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> was deserted by his troops, who were seduced by the instructions and example of their perfidious officers.
 After wandering some time among the woods and mountains of Phrygia, he was betrayed by his desponding followers, conducted to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp, and immediately beheaded.
 He suffered the ordinary fate of an unsuccessful usurper, but the acts of cruelty which were exercised by the conqueror, under the forms of legal justice, excited the pity and indignation of mankind.
(42) Severe inquisition into the crime of magic at <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Antioch, A.
D.
 373, etc Such indeed are the common and natural fruits of despotism and rebellion.
 But the inquisition into the crime of magic, which, under the reign of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers, was so rigorously prosecuted both at <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Antioch, was interpreted as the fatal symptom, either of the displeasure of Heaven or of the depravity of mankind.
(43) Let us not hesitate to indulge a liberal pride that, in the present age, the enlightened part of <LOC>Europe</LOC> has abolished(44) a cruel and odious prejudice, which reigned in every climate of the globe and adhered to every system of religious opinions.
(45) The nations and the sects of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world admitted, with equal credulity and similar abhorrence, the reality of that infernal art(46) which was able to control the eternal order of the planets and the voluntary operations of the human mind.
 They dreaded the mysterious power of spells and incantations, of potent herbs and execrable rites, which could extinguish or recall life, inflame the passions of the soul, blast the works of creation, and extort from the reluctant daemons the secrets of futurity.
 They believed, with the wildest inconsistency, that this preternatural dominion of the air, of earth, and of hell was exercised, from the vilest motives of malice or gain, by some wrinkled hags and itinerant sorcerers, who passed their obscure lives in penury and contempt.
 (47) The arts of magic were equally condemned by the public opinion and by the laws of Rome, but, as they tended to gratify the most imperious passions of the heart of man, they were continually proscribed and continually practised.
(48) An imaginary cause is capable of producing the most serious and mischievous effects.
 The dark predictions of the death of an emperor or the success of a conspiracy were calculated only to stimulate the hopes of ambition and to dissolve the ties of fidelity, and the intentional guilt of magic was aggravated by the actual crimes of treason and sacrilege.
 (49) Such vain terrors disturbed the peace of society and the happiness of individuals, and the harmless flame which insensibly melted a waxen image might derive a powerful and pernicious energy from the affrighted fancy of the person whom it was maliciously designed to represent.
 (50) From the infusion of those herbs which were supposed to possess a supernatural influence it was an easy step to the use of more substantial poison, and the folly of mankind sometimes became the instrument and the mask of the most atrocious crimes.
 As soon as the zeal of informers was encouraged by the ministers of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> and Valentinian, they could not refuse to listen to another charge too frequently mingled in the scenes of domestic guilt, a charge of a softer and less malignant nature, for which the pious though excessive rigour of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had recently decreed the punishment of death.
(51) This deadly and incoherent mixture of treason and magic, of poison and adultery, afforded infinite gradations of guilt and innocence, of excuse and aggravation, which in these proceedings appear to have been confounded by the angry or corrupt passions of the judges.
 They easily discovered that the degree of their industry and discernment was estimated by the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court according to the number of executions that were furnished from their respective tribunals.
 It was not without extreme reluctance that they pronounced a sentence of acquittal, but they eagerly admitted such evidence as was stained with perjury or procured by torture to prove the most improbable charges against the most respectable characters.
 The progress of the inquiry continually opened new subjects of criminal prosecution; the audacious informer, whose falsehood was detected, retired with impunity; but the wretched victim who discovered his real or pretended accomplices was seldom permitted to receive the price of his infamy.
 From the extremity of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> the young and the aged were dragged in chains to the tribunals of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Antioch.
 Senators, matrons, and philosophers expired in ignominious and cruel tortures.
 The soldiers who were appointed to guard the prisons declared, with a murmur of pity and indignation, that their numbers were insufficient to oppose the flight or resistance of the multitude of captives.
 The wealthiest families were ruined by fines and confiscations; the most innocent citizens trembled for their safety; and we may form some notion of the magnitude of the evil from the extravagant assertion of an ancient writer, that in the obnoxious provinces the prisoners, the exiles, and the fugitives formed the greatest part of the inhabitants.
(52) The cruelty of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> and Valens.
 A.
D.
 364-375.
 When <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> describes the deaths of the innocent and illustrious <NORP>Romans</NORP> who were sacrificed to the cruelty of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Caesars, the art of the historian, or the merit of the sufferers, excites in our breasts the most lively sensations of terror, of admiration, and of pity.
 The coarse and undistinguishing pencil of <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> has delineated his bloody figures with tedious and disgusting accuracy.
 But as our attention is no longer engaged by the contrast of freedom and servitude, of recent greatness and of actual misery, we should turn with horror from the frequent executions which disgraced, both at <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Antioch, the reign of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers.
(53) <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> was of a timid,(54) and <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> of a choleric, disposition.
(55) An anxious regard to his personal safety was the ruling principle of the administration of Valens.
 In the condition of a subject, he had kissed, with trembling awe, the hand of the oppressor; and when he ascended the throne, he reasonably expected that the same fears which had subdued his own mind should secure the patient submission of his people.
 The favourites of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> obtained, by the privilege of rapine and confiscation, the wealth which his economy would have refused.
(56) They urged, with persuasive eloquence, that in all cases of treason, suspicion is equivalent to proof; that the power supposes the intention of mischief; that the intention is not less criminal than the act; and that a subject no longer deserves to live, if his life may threaten the safety, or disturb the repose, of his sovereign.
 The judgment of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was sometimes deceived, and his confidence abused; but he would have silenced the informers with a contemptuous smile, had they presumed to alarm his fortitude by the sound of danger.
 They praised his inflexible love of justice; and, in the pursuit of justice, the emperor was easily tempted to consider clemency as a weakness, and passion as a virtue.
 As long as he wrestled with his equals in the bold competition of an active and ambitious life, <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was seldom injured, and never insulted, with impunity: if his prudence was arraigned, his spirit was applauded; and the proudest and most powerful generals were apprehensive of provoking the resentment of a fearless soldier.
 After he became master of the world, he unfortunately forgot that, where no resistance can be made, no courage can be exerted; and instead of consulting the dictates of reason and magnanimity, he indulged the furious emotions of his temper, at a time when they were disgraceful to himself, and fatal to the defenceless objects of his displeasure.
 In the government of his household, or of his empire, slight, or even imaginary offences — a hasty word, a casual omission, an involuntary delay — were chastised by a sentence of immediate death.
 The expressions which issued the most readily from the mouth of the emperor of the <LOC>West</LOC> were, "Strike off his head;" — "Burn him alive;" "Let him be beaten with clubs till he expires;" (57) and his most favoured ministers soon understood that, by a rash attempt to dispute or suspend the execution of his sanguinary commands; they might involve themselves in the guilt and punishment of disobedience.
 The repeated gratification of this savage justice hardened the mind of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> against pity and remorse; and the sallies of passion were confirmed by the habits of cruelty.
 (58) He could behold with calm satisfaction the convulsive agonies of torture and death: he reserved his friendship for those faithful servants whose temper was the most congenial to his own.
 The merit of Maximin, who had slaughtered the noblest families of Rome, was rewarded with the royal approbation, and the praefecture of Gaul.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> fierce and enormous bears, distinguished by the appellations of <WORK_OF_ART>Innocence</WORK_OF_ART> and Mica Awea, could alone deserve to share the favour of Maximin.
 The cages of those trusty guards were always placed near the bed-chamber of Valentinian, who frequently amused his eyes with the grateful spectacle of seeing them tear and devour the bleeding limbs of the malefactors who were abandoned to their rage.
 Their diet and exercises were carefully inspected by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor; and when <WORK_OF_ART>Innocence</WORK_OF_ART> had earned her discharge, by a long course of meritorious service, the faithful animal was again restored to the freedom of her native woods.
 (59) Their laws and government.
 But in the calmer moments of reflection, when the mind of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> was not agitated by fear, or that of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> by rage, the tyrant resumed the sentiments, or at least the conduct, of the father of his country.
 The dispassionate judgment of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor could clearly perceive, and accurately pursue, his own and the public interest; and the sovereign of the East, who imitated with equal docility the various examples which he received from his elder brother, was sometimes guided by the wisdom and virtue of the praefect Sallust.
 Both princes invariably retained, in the purple, the chaste and temperate simplicity which had adorned their private life; and, under their reign, the pleasures of the court never cost the people a blush or a sigh.
 They gradually reformed many of the abuses of the times of Constantius, judiciously adopted and improved the designs of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> and his successor; and displayed a style and spirit of legislation which might inspire posterity with the most favourable opinion of their character and government.
 It is not from the master of <WORK_OF_ART>Innocence</WORK_OF_ART> that we should expect the tender regard for the welfare of his subjects which prompted <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> to condemn the exposition of newborn infants,(60) and to establish <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> skilful physicians, with stipends and privileges, in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> quarters of Rome.
 The good sense of an illiterate soldier founded an useful and liberal institution for the education of youth, and the support of declining science.
(61) It was his intention that the arts of rhetoric and grammar should be taught, in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Latin</NORP> languages, in the metropolis of every province; and as the size and dignity of the school was usually proportioned to the importance of the city, the academies of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> claimed a just and singular pre-eminence.
 The fragments of the literary edicts of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> imperfectly represent the school of Constantinople, which was gradually improved by subsequent regulations.
 That school consisted of <CARDINAL>thirty-one</CARDINAL> professors in different branches of learning.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> philosopher and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> lawyers; <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> sophists and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> grammarians for the Greek, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> orators and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> grammarians for the <NORP>Latin</NORP> tongue; besides <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> scribes, or, as they were then styled, antiquarians, whose laborious pens supplied the public library with fair and correct copies of the classic writers.
 The rule of conduct which was prescribed to the students is the more curious, as it affords the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> outlines of the form and discipline of a modern university.
 It was required that they should bring proper certificates from the magistrates of their native province.
 Their names, professions, and places of abode, were regularly entered in a public register.
 The studious youth were severely prohibited from wasting their time in feasts or in the theatre; and the term of their education was limited to the age of twenty.
 The praefect of the city was empowered to chastise the idle and refractory by stripes or expulsion; and he was directed to make an annual report to the master of the offices, that the knowledge and abilities of the scholars might be usefully applied to the public service.
 The institutions of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> contributed to secure the benefits of peace and plenty; and the cities were guarded by the establishment of the Defensors;(62) freely elected as the tribunes and advocates of the people, to support their rights, and to expose their grievances, before the tribunals of the civil magistrates; or even at the foot of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> throne.
 The finances were diligently administered by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes who had been so long accustomed to the rigid economy of a private fortune; but in the receipt and application of the revenue, a discerning eye might observe some difference between the government of the <LOC>East</LOC> and of the West.
 <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> was persuaded that royal liberality can be supplied only by public oppression, and his ambition never aspired to secure, by their actual distress, the future strength and prosperity of his people.
 Instead of increasing the weight of taxes, which in the space of forty years had been gradually doubled, he reduced, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> years of his reign, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> fourth of the tribute of the East.
 (63) <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> appears to have been less attentive and less anxious to relieve the burthens of his people.
 He might reform the abuses of the fiscal administration; but he exacted, without scruple, a very large share of the private property; as he was convinced that the revenues which supported the luxury of individuals would be much more advantageously employed for the defence and improvement of the state.
 The subjects of the East, who enjoyed the present benefit, applauded the indulgence of their prince.
 The solid, but less splendid merit of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was felt and acknowledged by the subsequent generation.
(64) <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> maintains the religious toleration.
 A.
D.
 364-375.
 But the most honourable circumstance of the character of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> is the firm and temperate impartiality which he uniformly preserved in an age of religious contention.
 His strong sense, unenlightened, but uncorrupted, by study, declined, with respectful indifference, the subtle questions of theological debate.
 The government of the <LOC>Earth</LOC> claimed his vigilance, and satisfied his ambition; and while he remembered that he was the disciple of the church, he never forgot that he was the sovereign of the clergy.
 Under the reign of an apostate, he had signalised his zeal for the honour of Christianity: he allowed to his subjects the privilege which he had assumed for himself; and they might accept with gratitude and confidence the general toleration which was granted by a prince addicted to passion, but incapable of fear or of disguise.
(65) The Pagans, the Jews, and all the various sects which acknowledged the divine authority of Christ, were protected by the laws from arbitrary power or popular insult; nor was any mode of worship prohibited by Valentinian, except those secret and criminal practices which abused the name of religion for the dark purposes of vice and disorder.
 The art of magic, as it was more cruelly punished, was more strictly proscribed: but the emperor admitted a formal distinction to protect the ancient methods of divination, which were approved by the senate and exercised by the <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> haruspices.
 He had condemned, with the consent of the most rational Pagans, the licence of nocturnal sacrifices; but he immediately admitted the petition of Praetextatus, proconsul of Achaia, who represented that the life of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> would become dreary and comfortless if they were deprived of the invaluable blessing of the <NORP>Eleusinian</NORP> mysteries.
 Philosophy alone can boast (and perhaps it is no more than the boast of philosophy) that her gentle hand is able to eradicate from the human mind the latent and deadly principle of fanaticism.
 But this truce of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years, which was inforced by the wise and vigorous government of Valentinian, by suspending the repetition of mutual injuries, contributed to soften the manners, and abate the prejudices, of the religious factions.
 <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> professes Arianism, and persecutes the catholics.
 A.
D.
 367-378.
 The friend of toleration was unfortunately placed at a distance from the scene of the fiercest controversies.
 As soon as the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of the <LOC>West</LOC> had extricated themselves from the snares of the creed of Rimini, they happily relapsed into the slumber of orthodoxy; and the small remains of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> party, that still subsisted at <ORG>Sirmium</ORG> or Milan, might be considered rather as objects of contempt than of resentment.
 But in the provinces of the East, from the <LOC>Euxine</LOC> to the extremity of Thebais, the strength and numbers of the hostile factions were more equally balanced; and this equality, instead of recommending the counsels of peace, served only to perpetuate the horrors of religious war.
 The monks and bishops supported their arguments by invectives; and their invectives were sometimes followed by blows.
 <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> still reigned at Alexandria; the thrones of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and <GPE>Antioch</GPE> were occupied by <NORP>Arian</NORP> prelates; and every episcopal vacancy was the occasion of a popular tumult.
 The <NORP>Homoousians</NORP> were fortified by the reconciliation of <CARDINAL>fifty-nine</CARDINAL> Macedonian, or Semi-Arian, bishops but their secret reluctance to embrace the divinity of the Holy Ghost clouded the splendour of the triumph; and the declaration of Valens, who, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> years of his reign, had imitated the impartial conduct of his brother, was an important victory on the side of Arianism.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers had passed their private life in the condition of catechumens; but the piety of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> prompted him to solicit the sacraments of baptism before he exposed his person to the dangers of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war.
 He naturally addressed himself to Eudoxus,(66) bishop of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city; and if the ignorant monarch was instructed by that <NORP>Arian</NORP> pastor in the principles of heterodox theology, his misfortune, rather than his guilt, was the inevitable consequence of his erroneous choice.
 Whatever had been the determination of the emperor, he must have offended a numerous party of his <NORP>Christian</NORP> subjects; as the leaders both of the <NORP>Homoousians</NORP> and of the <PERSON>Arians</PERSON> believed that, if they were not suffered to reign, they were most cruelly injured and oppressed.
 After he had taken this decisive step, it was extremely difficult for him to preserve either the virtue, or the reputation, of impartiality.
 He never aspired, like Constantius, to the fame of a profound theologian; but, as he had received with simplicity and respect the tenets of Eudoxus, <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> resigned his conscience to the direction of his ecclesiastical guides, and promoted by the influence of his authority the reunion of the <NORP>Athanasian</NORP> heretics to the body of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 At <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> he pitied their blindness; by degrees he was provoked at their obstinacy; and he insensibly hated those sectaries to whom he was an object of hatred.
 (67) The feeble mind of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> was always swayed by the persons with whom he familiarly conversed; and the exile or imprisonment of a private citizen are the favours the most readily granted in a despotic court.
 Such punishments were frequently inflicted on the leaders of the <NORP>Homoousian</NORP> party; and the misfortune of four-score ecclesiastics of Constantinople, who, perhaps accidentally, were burnt on shipboard, was imputed to the cruel and premeditated malice of the emperor and his <NORP>Arian</NORP> ministers.
 In every contest the catholics (if we may anticipate that name) were obliged to pay the penalty of their own faults, and of those of their adversaries.
 In every election the claims of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> candidate obtained the preference; and if they were opposed by the majority of the people, he was usually supported by the authority of the civil magistrate, or even by the terrors of a military force.
 The enemies of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> attempted to disturb the last years of his venerable age; and his temporary retreat to his father's sepulchre has been celebrated as a <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> exile.
 But the zeal of a great people, who instantly flew to arms, intimidated the praefect: Death of Athanius, A.

 and the archbishop was permitted to end his life in peace and in glory, after a reign of forty-seven years.
 The death of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> was the signal of the persecution of Egypt; and the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> minister of Valens, who forcibly seated the worthless <PERSON>Lucius</PERSON> on the archiepiscopal throne, purchased the favour of the reigning party by the blood and sufferings of their <NORP>Christian</NORP> brethren.
 The free toleration of the heathen and <NORP>Jewish</NORP> worship was bitterly lamented, as a circumstance which aggravated the misery of the catholics, and the guilt of the impious tyrant of the East.
(68) Just idea of his persecution.
 The triumph of the orthodox party has left a deep stain of persecution on the memory of Valens; and the character of a prince who derived his virtues, as well as his vices, from a feeble understanding and a pusillanimous temper, scarcely deserves the labour of an apology.
 Yet candour may discover some reasons to suspect that the ecclesiastical ministers of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> often exceeded the orders, or even the intentions, of their master; and that the real measure of facts has been very liberally magnified by the vehement declamation and easy credulity of his antagonists.
 (69) 1.
 The silence of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> may suggest a probable argument that the partial severities which were exercised in the name and provinces of his colleague amounted only to some obscure and inconsiderable deviations from the established system of religious toleration; and the judicious historian, who has praised the equal temper of the elder brother, has not thought himself obliged to contrast the tranquillity of the <LOC>West</LOC> with the cruel persecution of the East.
(70) 2.
 Whatever credit may be allowed to vague and distant reports, the character, or at least the behaviour, of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> may be most distinctly seen in his personal transactions with the eloquent Basil, archbishop of Gaesarea, who had succeeded <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> in the management of the <NORP>Trinitarian</NORP> cause.
(71) The circumstantial narrative has been composed by the friends and admirers of Basil; and as soon as we have stripped away a thick coat of rhetoric and miracle, we shall be astonished by the unexpected mildness of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> tyrant, who admired the firmness of his character, or was apprehensive, if he employed violence, of a general revolt in the province of Cappadocia.
 The archbishop, who asserted, with inflexible pride, (72) the truth of his opinions and the dignity of his rank, was left in the free possession of his conscience and his throne.
 The emperor devoutly assisted at the solemn service of the cathedral; and, instead of a sentence of banishment, subscribed the donation of a valuable estate for the use of an hospital which <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> had lately founded in the neighbourhood of Casarea.
(73) 3.
 I am not able to discover that any law (such as <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> afterwards enacted against the Arians) was published by <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> against the <NORP>Athanasian</NORP> sectaries; and the edict which excited the most violent clamours may not appear so extremely reprehensible.
 The emperor had observed that several of his subjects, gratifying their lazy disposition under the pretence of religion, had associated themselves with the monks of Egypt; and he directed the count of the <LOC>East</LOC> to drag them from their solitude, and to compel those deserters of society to accept the fair alternative of renouncing their temporal possessions, or of discharging the public duties of men and citizens.
 (74) The ministers of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> seem to have extended the sense of this penal statute, since they claimed a right of enlisting the young and able-bodied monks in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 A detachment of cavalry and infantry, consisting of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand men, marched from <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> into the adjacent desert of Nitria, (75) which was peopled by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> thousand monks.
 The soldiers were conducted by <NORP>Arian</NORP> priests; and it is reported that a considerable slaughter was made in the monasteries which disobeyed the commands of their sovereign.
(76) <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> restrains the avarice of his clergy.
 A.
D.
 370.
 The strict regulations which have been framed by the wisdom of modern legislators to restrain the wealth and avarice of the clergy may be originally deduced from the example of the emperor Valentinian.
 His edict, (77) addressed to Damasus, bishop of Rome, was publicly read in the churches of the city.
 He admonished the ecclesiastics and monks not to frequent the houses of widows and virgins; and menaced their disobedience with the animadversion of the civil judge.
 The director was no longer permitted to receive any gift, or legacy, or inheritance, from the liberality of his spiritual daughter: every testament contrary to this edict was declared null and void: and the illegal donation was confiscated for the use of the treasury.
 By a subsequent regulation it should seem that the same provisions were extended to nuns and bishops; and that all persons of the ecclesiastical order were rendered incapable of receiving any testamentary gifts, and strictly confined to the natural and legal rights of inheritance.
 As the guardian of domestic happiness and virtue, <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> applied this severe remedy to the growing evil.
 In the capital of the empire the females of noble and opulent houses possessed a very ample share of independent property; and many of those devout females had embraced the doctrines of Christianity, not only with the cold assent of the understanding, but with the warmth of affection, and perhaps with the eagerness of fashion.
 They sacrificed the pleasures of dress and luxury; and renounced, for the praise of chastity, the soft endearments of conjugal society.
 Some ecclesiastic, of real or apparent sanctity, was chosen to direct their timorous conscience, and to amuse the vacant tenderness of their heart: and the unbounded confidence which they hastily bestowed was often abused by knaves and enthusiasts, who hastened from the extremities of the East, to enjoy, on a splendid theatre, the privileges of the monastic profession.
 By their contempt of the world, they insensibly acquired its most desirable advantages; the lively attachment, perhaps, of a young and beautiful woman, the delicate plenty of an opulent household, and the respectful homage of the slaves, the freedmen, and the clients of a senatorial family.
 The immense fortunes of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> ladies were gradually consumed in lavish alms and expensive pilgrimages; and the artful monk, who had assigned himself the first, or possibly the sole place, in the testament of his spiritual daughter, still presumed to declare, with the smooth face of hypocrisy, that he was only the instrument of charity, and the steward of the poor.
 The lucrative, but disgraceful, trade,(78) which was exercised by the clergy to defraud the expectations of the natural heirs, had provoked the indignation of a superstitious age: and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of the most respectable of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> fathers very honestly confess that the ignominious edict of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was just and necessary; and that the <NORP>Christian</NORP> priests had deserved to lose a privilege which was still enjoyed by comedians, charioteers, and the ministers of idols.
 But the wisdom and authority of the legislator are seldom victorious in a contest with the vigilant dexterity of private interest: and Jerom, or Ambrose, might patiently acquiesce in the justice of an ineffectual or salutary law.
 If the ecclesiastics were checked in the pursuit of personal emolument, they would exert a more laudable industry to increase the wealth of the church; and dignify their covetousness with the specious names of piety and patriotism.
(79) Ambition and luxury of Damascus, bishop of Rome.
 A.
D.
 366-384.
 Damasus, bishop of Rome, who was constrained to stigmatise the avarice of his clergy by the publications of the law of Valentinian, had the good sense, or the good fortune, to engage in his service the zeal and abilities of the learned Jerom; and the grateful saint has celebrated the merit and purity of a very ambiguous character.
(80) But the splendid vices of the church of Rome, under the reign of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> and Damasus, have been curiously observed by the historian Ammianus, who delivers his impartial sense in these expressive words:— The schism of <PERSON>Damasus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ursinus</PERSON> was extinguished by the exile of the latter; and the wisdom of the praefect <PERSON>Praetextatus</PERSON> (86) restored the tranquillity of the city.
 <PERSON>Praetextatus</PERSON> was a philosophic Pagan, a man of learning, of taste, and politeness; who disguised a reproach in the form of a jest, when he assured <PERSON>Damasus</PERSON> that if he could obtain the bishopric of Rome, he himself would immediately embrace the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion.
(87) This lively picture of the wealth and luxury of the popes in the fourth century becomes the more curious as it represents the intermediate degree between the humble poverty of the apostolic fisherman and the royal state of a temporal prince whose dominions extend from the confines of <GPE>Naples</GPE> to the banks of the Po.
 Foreign wars, A.
D.
 364-375.
 When the suffrage of the generals and of the army committed the sceptre of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire to the hands of Valentinian, his reputation in arms, his military skill and experience, and his rigid attachment to the forms as well as spirit of ancient discipline, were the principal motives of their judicious choice.
 The eagerness of the troops, who pressed him to nominate his colleague, was justified by the dangerous situation of public affairs; and <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> himself was conscious that the abilities of the most active mind were unequal to the defence of the distant frontiers of an invaded monarchy.
 As soon as the death of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had relieved the barbarians from the terror of his name, the most sanguine hopes of rapine and conquest excited the nations of the East, of the North, and of the South.

Their inroads were often vexatious, and sometimes formidable; but, during the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years of the reign of Valentinian, his firmness and vigilance protected his own dominions; and his powerful genius seemed to inspire and direct the feeble counsels of his brother.
 Perhaps the method of annals would more forcibly express the urgent and divided cares of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors; but the attention of the reader, likewise, would be distracted by a tedious and desultory narrative.

 The ambassadors of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> had been offended by the harsh and haughty behaviour of Ursacius, master of the offices;(88) who, by an act of unseasonable parsimony, had diminished the value, as well as the quantity, of the presents to which they were entitled, either from custom or treaty, on the accession of a new emperor.
 They expressed, and they communicated to their countrymen, their strong sense of the national affront.
 The irascible minds of the chiefs were exasperated by the suspicion of contempt; and the martial youth crowded to their standard.
 Before <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> could pass the Alps, the villages of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> were in flames; before his general <ORG>Dagalaiphus</ORG> could encounter the Alemanni, they had secured the captives and the spoil in the forests of Germany.
 A.
D.
 366.
 JanuaryIn the beginning of the ensuing year the military force of the whole nation, in deep and solid columns, broke through the barrier of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> during the severity of a northern winter.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> counts were defeated and mortally wounded; and the standard of the <PERSON>Heruli</PERSON> and <NORP>Batavians</NORP> fell into the hands of the conquerors, who displayed, with insulting shouts and menaces, the trophy of their victory.
 The standard was recovered; but the <NORP>Batavians</NORP> had not redeemed the shame of their disgrace and flight in the eyes of their severe judge.
 It was the opinion of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> that his soldiers must learn to fear their commander before they could cease to fear the enemy.
 The troops were solemnly assembled; and the trembling <NORP>Batavians</NORP> were enclosed within the circle of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> army.
 <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> then ascended his tribunal; and, as if he disdained to punish cowardice with death, he inflicted a stain of indelible ignominy on the officers whose misconduct and pusillanimity were found to be the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> occasion of the defeat.
 The <NORP>Batavians</NORP> were degraded from their rank, stripped of their arms and condemned to be sold for slaves to the highest bidder.
 At this tremendous sentence the troops fell prostrate on the ground, deprecated the indignation of their sovereign, and protested that if he would indulge them in another trial, they would approve themselves not unworthy of the name of Romans, and of his soldiers.
 Valentinian, with affected reluctance, yielded to their entreaties: the <NORP>Batavians</NORP> resumed their arms; and, with their arms, the invincible resolution of wiping away their disgrace in the blood of the Alemanni.
 (89) The principal command was declined by Dagalaiphus; and that experienced general, who had represented, perhaps with too much prudence, the extreme difficulties of the undertaking, had the mortification, before the end of the campaign, of seeing his rival <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> convert those difficulties into a decisive advantage over the scattered forces of the barbarians.
Their defeat.
 At the head of a well-disciplined army of cavalry, infantry, and light troops, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> advanced, with cautious and rapid steps, to Scarponna,(90) in the territory of Metz, where he surprised a large division of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> before they had time to run to their arms; and flushed his soldiers with the confidence of an easy and bloodless victory.
 Another division, or rather army, of the enemy, after the cruel and wanton devastation of the adjacent country, reposed themselves on the shady banks of the Moselle.
 Jovinus, who had viewed the ground with the eye of a general, made his silent approach through a deep and woody vale, till he could distinctly perceive the indolent security of the Germans.
 Some were bathing their huge limbs in the river; others were combing their long and flaxen hair; others again were swallowing large draughts of rich and delicious wine.
 On a sudden they heard the sound of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> trumpet; they saw the enemy in their camp.
 Astonishment produced disorder; disorder was followed by flight and dismay; and the confused multitude of the bravest warriors was pierced by the swords and javelins of the legionaries and auxiliaries.
 The fugitives escaped to the third, and most considerable, camp in the Catalaunian plains, near <LOC>Chalons</LOC> in Champagne: the straggling detachments were hastily recalled to their standard; and the barbarian chiefs, alarmed and admonished by the fate of their companions, prepared to encounter in a decisive battle the victorious forces of the lieutenant of Valentinian.
 The bloody and obstinate conflict lasted a whole summer's day, with equal valour and with alternate success.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> at length prevailed, with the loss of about <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> hundred men.
 Six thousand of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> were slain, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand were wounded; and the brave Jovinus, after chasing the flying remnant of their host as far as the banks of the Rhine, July.
 returned to Paris, to receive the applause of his sovereign, and the ensigns of the consulship for the ensuing year.
(91) The triumph of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was indeed sullied by their treatment of the captive king, whom they hung on a gibbet, without the knowledge of their indignant general.
 This disgraceful act of cruelty, which might be imputed to the fury of the troops, was followed by the deliberate murder of Withicab, the son of Vadomair, a <NORP>German</NORP> prince, of a weak and sickly constitution, but of a daring and formidable spirit.
 The domestic assassin was instigated and protected by the Romans; (92) and the violation of the laws of humanity and justice betrayed their secret apprehension of the weakness of the declining empire.
 The use of the dagger is seldom adopted in public councils, as long as they retain any confidence in the power of the sword.
 <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> passes, and fortifies the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> , A.
D.
 368.
 While the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> appeared to be humbled by their recent calamities, the pride of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was mortified by the unexpected surprisal of Moguntiacum, or Mentz, the principal city of the Upper Germany.
 In the unsuspicious moment of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> festival, Rando, a bold and artful chieftain, who had long meditated his attempt, suddenly passed the Rhine, entered the defenceless town, and retired with a multitude of captives of either sex.
 <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> resolved to execute severe vengeance on the whole body of the nation.
 Count Sebastian, with the bands of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Illyricum, was ordered to invade their country, most probably on the side of Rhaetia.
 The emperor in person, accompanied by his son Gratian, passed the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> at the head of a formidable army, which was supported on both flanks by <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Severus, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> master-generals of the cavalry and infantry of the West.
 The Alemanni, unable to prevent the devastation of their villages, fixed their camp on a lofty and almost inaccessible mountain in the modern duchy of Wirtemberg, and resolutely expected the approach of the Romans.
 The life of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was exposed to imminent danger by the intrepid curiosity with which he persisted to explore some secret and unguarded path.
 A troop of barbarians suddenly rose from their ambuscade; and the emperor, who vigorously spurred his horse down a steep and slippery descent, was obliged to leave behind him his armour-bearer, and his helmet magnificently enriched with gold and precious stones.
 At the signal of the general assault, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops encompassed and ascended the mountain of <LOC>Solicinium</LOC> on <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> different sides.
 Every step which they gained increased their ardour, and abated the resistance of the enemy: and after their united forces had occupied the summit of the hill, they impetuously urged the barbarians down the northern descent, where Count <PERSON>Sebastian</PERSON> was posted to intercept their retreat.
 After this signal victory <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> returned to his <DATE>winter</DATE> quarters at Treves, where he indulged the public joy by the exhibition of splendid and triumphal games.
(93) But the wise monarch, instead of aspiring to the conquest of Germany, confined his attention to the important and laborious defence of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> frontier, against an enemy whose strength was renewed by a stream of daring volunteers, which incessantly flowed from the most distant tribes of the North.
(94) The banks of the Rhine, from its source to the straits of the ocean, were closely planted with strong castles and convenient towers; new works and new arms were invented by the ingenuity of a prince who was skilled in the mechanical arts; and his numerous levies of <NORP>Roman</NORP> and barbarian youth were severely trained in all the exercises of war.
 The progress of the work, which was sometimes opposed by modest representations and sometimes by hostile attempts, secured the tranquillity of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> during the nine subsequent years of the administration of Valentinian.
(95) The Burgundians.
 A.
D.
 371 That prudent emperor, who diligently practised the wise maxims of Diocletian, was studious to foment and excite the intestine divisions of the tribes of Germany.
 About the middle of the fourth century, the countries, perhaps of <GPE>Lusace</GPE> and Thuringia, on either side of the Elbe, were occupied by the vague dominion of the BURGUNDIANS, a warlike and numerous people of the <NORP>Vandal</NORP> race,(96) whose obscure name insensibly swelled into a powerful kingdom, and has finally settled on a flourishing province.
 The most remarkable circumstance in the ancient manners of the <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> appears to have been the difference of their civil and ecclesiastical constitution.
 The appellation of <PERSON>Hendinos</PERSON> was given to the king or general, and the title of <PERSON>Sinistus</PERSON> to the high-priest of the nation.
 The person of the priest was sacred, and his dignity perpetual; but the temporal government was held by a very precarious tenure.
 If the events of war accused the courage or conduct of the king, he was immediately deposed; and the injustice of his subjects made him responsible for the fertility of the earth and the regularity of the seasons, which seemed to fall more properly within the sacerdotal department.
(97) The disputed possession of some salt-pits(98) engaged the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and the <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> in frequent contests: the latter were easily tempted by the secret solicitations and liberal offers of the emperor; and their fabulous descent from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> soldiers who had formerly been left to garrison the fortresses of <PERSON>Drusus</PERSON> was admitted with mutual credulity, as it was conducive to mutual interest.
 (99) An army of four-score thousand <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> soon appeared on the banks of the Rhine, and impatiently required the support and subsidies which <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> had promised; but they were amused with excuses and delays, till at length, after a fruitless expectation, they were compelled to retire.
 The arms and fortifications of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> frontier checked the fury of their just resentment; and their massacre of the captives served to embitter the hereditary feud of the <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> and the Alemanni.
 The inconstancy of a wise prince may perhaps be explained by some alteration of circumstances; and perhaps it was the original design of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> to intimidate rather than to destroy; as the balance of power would have been equally overturned by the extirpation of either of the <NORP>German</NORP> nations.
 Among the princes of the Alemanni, Macrianus, who, with a <NORP>Roman</NORP> name, had assumed the arts of a soldier and a statesman, deserved his hatred and esteem.
 The emperor himself, with a light and unencumbered band, condescended to pass the Rhine, marched <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> miles into the country, and would infallibly have seized the object of his pursuit, if his judicious measures had not been defeated by the impatience of the troops.
 <PERSON>Macrianus</PERSON> was afterwards admitted to the honour of a personal conference with the emperor, and the favours which he received fixed him, till the hour of his death, a steady and sincere friend of the republic.
(100) The Saxons.
 The land was covered by the fortifications of Valentinian; but the sea-coast of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Britain</GPE> was exposed to the depredations of the Saxons.
 That celebrated name, in which we have a clear and domestic interest, escaped the notice of Tacitus; and in the maps of <LOC>Ptolemy</LOC> it faintly marks the narrow neck of the Cimbric peninsula, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> small islands towards the mouth of the Elbe.
(101) This contracted territory, the present duchy of Schleswig, or perhaps of Holstein, was incapable of pouring forth the inexhaustible swarms of <NORP>Saxons</NORP> who reigned over the ocean, who filled the <NORP>British</NORP> island with their language, their laws, and their colonies, and who so long defended the liberty of the <LOC>North</LOC> against the arms of Charlemagne.
 (102) The solution of this difficulty is easily derived from the similar manners and loose constitution of the tribes of Germany, which were blended with each other by the slightest accidents of war or friendship.
 The situation of the native <NORP>Saxons</NORP> disposed them to embrace the hazardous professions of fishermen and pirates; and the success of their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> adventures would naturally excite the emulation of their bravest countrymen, who were impatient of the gloomy solitude of their woods and mountains.
 Every tide might float down the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> whole fleets of canoes, filled with hardy and intrepid associates, who aspired to behold the unbounded prospect of the ocean, and to taste the wealth and luxury of unknown worlds.
 It should seem probable, however, that the most numerous auxiliaries of the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> were furnished by the nations who dwelt along the shores of the Baltic.
 They possessed arms and ships, the art of navigation, and the habits of naval war; but the difficulty of issuing through the northern Columns of Hercules(103) (which during several months of the year are obstructed with ice) confined their skill and courage within the limits of a spacious lake.
 The rumour of the successful armaments which sailed from the mouth of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> would soon provoke them to cross the narrow isthmus of Schleswig, and to launch their vessels on the great sea.
 The various troops of pirates and adventurers who fought under the same standard were insensibly united in a permanent society, at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of rapine, and afterwards of government.
 A military confederation was gradually moulded into a national body by the gentle operation of marriage and consanguinity; and the adjacent tribes, who solicited the alliance, accepted the name and laws of the Saxons.
 If the fact were not established by the most unquestionable evidence, we should appear to abuse the credulity of our readers by the description of the vessels in which the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates ventured to sport in the waves of the <NORP>German</NORP> Ocean, the <NORP>British</NORP> Channel, and the Bay of Biscay.
 The keel of their large flat-bottomed boats was framed of light timber, but the sides and upper works consisted only of wicker, with a covering of strong hides.
 (104) In the course of their slow and distant navigations they must always have been exposed to the danger, and very frequently to the misfortune, of shipwreck; and the naval annals of the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> were undoubtedly filled with the accounts of the losses which they sustained on the coasts of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Gaul.
 But the daring spirit of the pirates braved the perils both of the sea and of the shore: their skill was confirmed by the habits of enterprise; the meanest of their mariners was alike capable of handling an oar, of rearing a sail, or of conducting a vessel and the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> rejoiced in the appearance of a tempest, which concealed their design, and dispersed the fleets of the enemy.
 (105) After they had acquired an accurate knowledge of the maritime provinces of the <LOC>West</LOC> they extended the scene of their depredations, and the most sequestered places had no reason to presume on their security.
 The <NORP>Saxon</NORP> boats drew so little water that they could easily proceed four-score or an hundred miles up the great rivers; their weight was so inconsiderable that they were transported on waggons from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> river to another; and the pirates who had entered the mouth of the <LOC>Seine</LOC> or of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> might descend, A.
D.
 371 with the rapid stream of the Rhone, into the Mediterranean.
 Under the reign of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> the maritime provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> were afflicted by the Saxons: a military count was stationed for the defence of the sea-coast, or <NORP>Armorican</NORP> limit; and that officer, who found his strength or his abilities unequal to the task, implored the assistance of Severus, master-general of the infantry.
 The Saxons, surrounded and outnumbered, were forced to relinquish their spoil, and to yield a select band of their tall and robust youth to serve in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 They stipulated only a safe and honourable retreat; and the condition was readily granted by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, who meditated an act of perfidy, (106) imprudent as it was inhuman, while a <NORP>Saxon</NORP> remained alive and in arms to revenge the fate of his countrymen.
 The premature eagerness of the infantry, who were secretly posted in a deep valley, betrayed the ambuscade and they would perhaps have fallen the victims of their own treachery, if a large body of cuirassiers, alarmed by the noise of the combat, had not hastily advanced to extricate their companions, and to overwhelm the undaunted valour of the Saxons.
 Some of the prisoners were saved from the edge of the sword to shed their blood in the amphitheatre; and the orator <PERSON>Symmachus</PERSON> complains that <CARDINAL>twenty-nine</CARDINAL> of those desperate savages, by strangling themselves with their own hands, had disappointed the amusement of the public.
 Yet the polite and philosophic citizens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were impressed with the deepest horror when they were informed that the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> consecrated to the gods the tithe of their human spoil; and that they ascertained by lot the objects of the barbarous sacrifice.
(107) The Britain.
The <NORP>Scots</NORP> and Picts.
 II.
 The fabulous colonies of <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> and Trojans, of <NORP>Scandinavians</NORP> and Spaniards, which flattered the pride and amused the credulity of our rude ancestors, have insensibly vanished in the light of science and philosophy.
(108) The present age is satisfied with the simple and rational opinion that the islands of Great <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Ireland</GPE> were gradually peopled from the adjacent continent of Gaul.
 From the coast of Kent, to the extremity of <LOC>Caithness</LOC> and Ulster, the memory of a <NORP>Celtic</NORP> origin was distinctly preserved in the perpetual resemblance of language, of religion, and of manners: and the peculiar characters of the <NORP>British</NORP> tribes might be naturally ascribed to the influence of accidental and local circumstances; (109) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> province was reduced to the state of civilised and peaceful servitude: the rights of savage freedom were contracted to the narrow limits of Caledonia.
 The inhabitants of that northern region were divided, as early as the reign of Constantine, between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great tribes of the <ORG>SCOTs</ORG> and of the PICTS(110) who have since experienced a very different fortune.
 The power, and almost the memory, of the <NORP>Picts</NORP> have been extinguished by their successful rivals; and the Scots, after maintaining for ages the dignity of an independent kingdom, have multiplied, by an equal and voluntary union, the honours of the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> name.
 The hand of nature had contributed to mark the ancient distinction of the <NORP>Scots</NORP> and Picts.
 The former were the men of the hills, and the latter those of the plain.
 The eastern coast of <GPE>Caledonia</GPE> may be considered as a level and fertile country, which, even in a rude state of tillage, was capable of producing a considerable quantity of corn; and the epithet of cruitnich, or wheat-eaters, expressed the contempt or envy of the carnivorous highlander.
 The cultivation of the earth might introduce a more accurate separation of property, and the habits of a sedentary life; but the love of arms and rapine was still the ruling passion of the Picts, and their warriors, who stripped themselves for a day of battle, were distinguished, in the eyes of the Romans, by the strange fashion of painting their naked bodies with gaudy colours and fantastic figures.
 The western part of <GPE>Caledonia</GPE> irregularly rises into wild and barren hills, which scarcely repay the toil of the husbandman, and are most profitably used for the pasture of cattle.
 The highlanders were condemned to the occupations of shepherds and hunters; and as they seldom were fixed to any permanent habitation, they acquired the expressive name of SCOTS, which, in the <NORP>Celtic</NORP> tongue, is said to be equivalent to that of wanderers, or vagrants.
 The inhabitants of a barren land were urged to seek a fresh supply of food in the waters.
 The deep lakes and bays which intersect their country are plentifully stored with fish; and they gradually ventured to cast their nets in the waves of the ocean.
 The vicinity of the Hebrides, so profusely scattered along the western coast of Scotland, tempted their curiosity and improved their skill; and they acquired, by slow degrees, the art, or rather the habit, of managing their boats in a tempestuous sea, and of steering their nocturnal course by the light of the well-known stars.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bold headlands of <GPE>Caledonia</GPE> almost touch the shores of a spacious island, which obtained, from its luxuriant vegetation, the epithet of Green; and has preserved, with a slight alteration, the name of Erin, or Ierne, or Ireland.
 It is probable that in some remote period of antiquity the fertile plains of <GPE>Ulster</GPE> received a colony of hungry Scots; and that the strangers of the North, who had dared to encounter the arms of the legions, spread their conquests over the savage and unwarlike natives of a solitary island.
 It is certain that, in the declining age of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, Caledonia, Ireland, and the Isle of Man were inhabited by the Scots, and that the kindred tribes, who were often associated in military enterprise, were deeply affected by the various accidents of their mutual fortunes.
 They long cherished the lively tradition of their common name and origin: and the missionaries of the Isle of Saints, who diffused the light of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> over <LOC>North</LOC> Britain, established the vain opinion that their <NORP>Irish</NORP> countrymen were the natural, as well as spiritual, fathers of the <NORP>Scottish</NORP> race.
 The loose and obscure tradition has been preserved by the venerable Bede, who scattered some rays of light over the darkness of the eighth century.
 On this slight foundation a huge superstructure of fable was gradually reared by the bards and the monks; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> orders of men who equally abused the privilege of fiction.
 The <NORP>Scottish</NORP> nation, with mistaken pride, adopted their <NORP>Irish</NORP> genealogy: and the annals of a long line of imaginary kings have been adorned by the fancy of <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> and the classic elegance of Buchanan.
(111) Their invasion of Britain, A.
D.
 343-366 Six years after the death of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the destructive inroads of the <NORP>Scots</NORP> and <NORP>Picts</NORP> required the presence of his youngest son, who reigned in the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> visited his <NORP>British</NORP> dominions: but we may form some estimate of the importance of his achievements by the language of panegyric, which celebrates only his triumph over the elements, or, in other words, the good fortune of a safe and easy passage from the port of <GPE>Boulogne</GPE> to the harbour of Sandwich.
(112) The calamities which the afflicted provincials continued to experience from foreign war and domestic tyranny were aggravated by the feeble and corrupt administration of the eunuchs of Constantius; and the transient relief which they might obtain from the virtues of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was soon lost by the absence and death of their benefactor.
 The sums of gold and silver which had been painfully collected, or liberally transmitted, for the payment of the troops, were intercepted by the avarice of the commanders; discharges, or, at least, exemptions, from the military service, were publicly sold; the distress of the soldiers, who were injuriously deprived of their legal and scanty subsistence, provoked them to frequent desertion; the nerves of discipline were relaxed, and the highways were infested with robbers.
 (113) The oppression of the good and the impunity of the wicked equally contributed to diffuse through the island a spirit of discontent and revolt; and every ambitious subject, every desperate exile, might entertain a reasonable hope of subverting the weak and distracted government of Britain.
 The hostile tribes of the North, who detested the pride and power of the <PERSON>King</PERSON> of the World, suspended their domestic feuds; and the barbarians of the land and sea, the Scots, the Picts, and the Saxons, spread themselves, with rapid and irresistible fury, from the wall of <GPE>Antonius</GPE> to the shores of Kent.
 Every production of art and nature, every object of convenience or luxury, which they were incapable of creating by labour or procuring by trade, was accumulated in the rich and fruitful province of Britain.
(114) A philosopher may deplore the eternal discord of the human race, but he will confess that the desire of spoil is a more rational provocation than the vanity of conquest.
 From the age of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to that of the <NORP>Plantagenets</NORP> this rapacious spirit continued to instigate the poor and hardy Caledonians: but the same people whose generous humanity seems to inspire the songs of <PERSON>Ossian</PERSON> was disgraced by a savage ignorance of the virtues of peace and of the laws of war.
 Their southern neighbours have felt, and perhaps exaggerated, the cruel depredations of the <NORP>Scots</NORP> and Picts; (115) and a valiant tribe of Caledonia, the Attacotti,(116) the enemies, and afterwards the soldiers, of Valentinian, are accused by an eyewitness of delighting in the taste of human flesh.
 When they hunted the woods for prey, it is said that they attacked the shepherd rather than his flock; and that they curiously selected the most delicate and brawny parts both of males and females, which they prepared for their horrid repasts.
 (117) If in the neighbourhood of the commercial and literary town of <GPE>Glasgow</GPE> a race of cannibals has really existed, we may contemplate in the period of the <NORP>Scottish</NORP> history the opposite extremes of savage and civilised life.
 Such reflections tend to enlarge the circle of our ideas, and to encourage the pleasing hope that New Zealand may produce in some future age the <PERSON>Hume</PERSON> of the Southern Hemisphere.
 Restoration of <GPE>Britain</GPE> by Theodosius, A.
D.
 367-370 Every messenger who escaped across the <NORP>British</NORP> channel conveyed the most melancholy and alarming tidings to the ears of Valentinian, and the emperor was soon informed that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> military commanders of the province had been surprised and cut off by the barbarians.
 Severus, count of the domestics, was hastily despatched, and as suddenly recalled, by the court of Treves.
 The representations of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> served only to indicate the greatness of the evil, and, after a long and serious consultation, the defence, or rather the recovery, of <GPE>Britain</GPE> was intrusted to the abilities of the brave Theodosius.
 The exploits of that general, the father of a line of emperors, have been celebrated, with peculiar complacency, by the writers of the age; but his real merit deserved their applause, and his nomination was received, by the army and province, as a sure presage of approaching victory.
 He seized the favourable moment of navigation, and securely landed the numerous and veteran bands of the <PERSON>Heruli</PERSON> and Batavians, the <NORP>Jovians</NORP> and the Victors.
 In his march from <GPE>Sandwich</GPE> to London, <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> defeated several parties of the barbarians, released a multitude of captives, and, after distributing to his soldiers a small portion of the spoil, established the fame of disinterested justice by the restitution of the remainder to the rightful proprietors.
 The citizens of London, who had almost despaired of their safety, threw open their gates, and, as soon as <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> had obtained from the court of <GPE>Treves</GPE> the important aid of a military lieutenant and a civil governor, he executed with wisdom and vigour the laborious task of the deliverance of Britain.
 The vagrant soldiers were recalled to their standard, an edict of amnesty dispelled the public apprehensions, and his cheerful example alleviated the rigour of martial discipline.
 The scattered and desultory warfare of the barbarians, who infested the land and sea, deprived him of the glory of a signal victory; but the prudent spirit and consummate art of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general were displayed in the operations of A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>368</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>369two</CARDINAL> campaigns, which successively rescued every part of the province from the hands of a cruel and rapacious enemy.
 The splendour of the cities and the security of the fortifications were diligently restored by the paternal care of Theodosius, who with a strong hand confined the trembling <NORP>Caledonians</NORP> to the northern angle of the island, and perpetuated, by the name and settlement of the new province of Valentia, the glories of the reign of Valentinian.
(118) The voice of poetry and panegyric may add, perhaps with some degree of truth, that the unknown regions of <LOC>Thule</LOC> were stained with the blood of the Picts, that the oars of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> dashed the waves of the <NORP>Hyperborean</NORP> ocean, and that the distant <NORP>Orkneys</NORP> were the scene of his naval victory over the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates.
 (119) He left the province with a fair as well as splendid reputation, and was immediately promoted to the rank of master-general of the cavalry by a prince who could applaud, without envy, the merit of his servants.
 In the important station of the Upper Danube, the conqueror of <GPE>Britain</GPE> checked and defeated the armies of the Alemanni, before he was chosen to suppress the revolt of Africa.
 III AFRICA.
 Tyranny of Romanus, A.
D.
 366, etc III.
 The prince who refuses to be the judge, instructs his people to consider him as the accomplice of his ministers.
 The military command of <LOC>Africa</LOC> had been long exercised by Count Romanus, and his abilities were not inadequate to his station; but as sordid interest was the sole motive of his conduct, he acted on most occasions as if he had been the enemy of the province, and the friend of the barbarians of the desert.
 The <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> flourishing cities of Oea, Leptis, and Sabrata, which, under the name of Tripoli, had long constituted a federal union,(120) were obliged, for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time, to shut their gates against a hostile invasion; several of their most honourable citizens were surprised and massacred, the villages and even the suburbs were pillaged, and the vines and fruit-trees of that rich territory were extirpated by the malicious savages of Gaetulia.
 The unhappy provincials implored the protection of Romanus; but they soon found that their military governor was not less cruel and rapacious than the barbarians.
 As they were incapable of furnishing the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand camels and the exorbitant present which he required before he would march to the assistance of Tripoli, his demand was equivalent to a refusal, and he might justly be accused as the author of the public calamity.
 In the annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> cities, they nominated <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> deputies to lay at the feet of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> the customary offering of a gold victory, and to accompany this tribute of duty, rather than of gratitude, with their humble complaint that they were ruined by the enemy and betrayed by their governor.
 If the severity of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> had been rightly directed, it would have fallen on the guilty head of Romanus.
 But the count, long exercised in the arts of corruption, had despatched a swift and trusty messenger to secure the venal friendship of Remigius, master of the offices.
 The wisdom of the imperial council was deceived by artifice, and their honest indignation was cooled by delay.
 At length, when the repetition of complaint had been justified by the repetition of public misfortunes, the notary <PERSON>Palladius</PERSON> was sent from the court of <GPE>Treves</GPE> to examine the state of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and the conduct of Romanus.
 The rigid impartiality of <PERSON>Palladius</PERSON> was easily disarmed.
 he was tempted to reserve for himself a part of the public treasure which he brought with him for the payment of the troops, and, from the moment that he was conscious of his own guilt, he could no longer refuse to attest the innocence and merit of the count.
 The charge of the <PERSON>Tripolitans</PERSON> was declared to be false and frivolous, and <PERSON>Palladius</PERSON> himself was sent back from <GPE>Treves</GPE> to <LOC>Africa</LOC> with a special commission to discover and prosecute the authors of this impious conspiracy against the representatives of the sovereign.
 His inquiries were managed with so much dexterity and success, that he compelled the citizens of Leptis, who had sustained a recent siege of eight days, to contradict the truth of their own decrees and to censure the behaviour of their own deputies.
 A bloody sentence was pronounced, without hesitation, by the rash and headstrong cruelty of Valentinian.
 The president of Tripoli, who had presumed to pity the distress of the province, was publicly executed at Utica; <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> distinguished citizens were put to death as the accomplices of the imaginary fraud, and the tongues of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> others were cut out by the express order of the emperor.
 Romanus, elated by impunity and irritated by resistance, was still continued in the military command, till the <NORP>Africans</NORP> were provoked, by his avarice, to join the rebellious standard of Firmus, the Moor.
(121) Revolt of Firmus.
 A.
D.
 372 His father <PERSON>Nabal</PERSON> was <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the richest and most powerful of the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> princes who acknowledged the supremacy of Rome.
 But as he left, either by his wives or concubines, a very numerous posterity, the wealthy inheritance was eagerly disputed, and Zamma, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his sons, was slain in a domestic quarrel by his brother Firmus.
 The implacable zeal with which <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> prosecuted the legal revenge of this murder could be ascribed only to a motive of avarice or personal hatred; but on this occasion his claims were just, his influence was weighty, and <ORG>Firmus</ORG> clearly understood that he must either present his neck to the executioner, or appeal from the sentence of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> consistory to his sword and to the people.
 (122) He was received as the deliverer of his country, and, as soon as it appeared that <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> was formidable only to a submissive province, the tyrant of <LOC>Africa</LOC> became the object of universal contempt.
 The ruin of Caesarea, which was plundered and burnt by the licentious barbarians, convinced the refractory cities of the danger of resistance; the power of <ORG>Firmus</ORG> was established, at least in the provinces of <GPE>Mauritania</GPE> and Numidia, and it seemed to be his only doubt whether he should assume the diadem of a <NORP>Moorish</NORP> king or the purple of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 But the imprudent and unhappy <NORP>Africans</NORP> soon discovered that, in this rash insurrection, they had not sufficiently consulted their own strength or the abilities of their leader.
 Before he could procure any certain intelligence that the emperor of the <LOC>West</LOC> had fixed the choice of a general, or that a fleet of transports was collected at the mouth of the Rhone, he was suddenly informed <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> recovers Africa.
 A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>373</CARDINAL> that the great Theodosius, with a small band of veterans, had landed near Igilgilis, or Gigeri, on the <NORP>African</NORP> coast, and the timid usurper sunk under the ascendant of virtue and military genius.
 Though <ORG>Firmus</ORG> possessed arms and treasures, his despair of victory immediately reduced him to the use of those arts which, in the same country and in a similar situation, had formerly been practised by the crafty Jugurtha.
 He attempted to deceive, by an apparent submission, the vigilance of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, to seduce the fidelity of his troops, and to protract the duration of the war by successively engaging the independent tribes of <LOC>Africa</LOC> to espouse his quarrel or to protect his flight.
 <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> imitated the example and obtained the success of his predecessor Metellus.
 When Firmus, in the character of a suppliant, accused his own rashness and humbly solicited the clemency of the emperor, the lieutenant of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> received and dismissed him with a friendly embrace; but he diligently required the useful and substantial pledges of a sincere repentance, nor could he be persuaded, by the assurances of peace, to suspend for an instant the operations of an active war.
 A dark conspiracy was detected by the penetration of Theodosius, and he satisfied, without much reluctance, the public indignation which he had secretly excited.
 Several of the guilty accomplices of <ORG>Firmus</ORG> were abandoned according to ancient custom, to the tumult of a military execution; many more, by the amputation of both their hands, continued to exhibit an instructive spectacle of horror; the hatred of the rebels was accompanied with fear, and the fear of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> soldiers was mingled with respectful admiration.
 Amidst the boundless plains of <LOC>Gaetulia</LOC> and the innumerable valleys of Mount Atlas, it was impossible to prevent the escape of Firmus; and if the usurper could have tired the patience of his antagonist, he would have secured his person in the depth of some remote solitude, and expected the hopes of a future revolution.
 He was subdued by the perseverance of Theodosius, who had formed an inflexible determination that the war should end only by the death of the tyrant, and that every nation of <LOC>Africa</LOC> which presumed to support his cause should be involved in his ruin.
 At the head of a small body of troops, which seldom exceeded <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred men, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general advanced with a steady prudence, devoid of rashness or of fear, into the heart of a country where he was sometimes attacked by armies of twenty thousand Moors.
 The boldness of his charge dismayed the irregular barbarians; they were disconcerted by his seasonable and orderly retreats; they were continually baffled by the unknown resources of the military art; and they felt and confessed the just superiority which was assumed by the leader of a civilised nation.
 When <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> entered the extensive dominions of Igmazen, king of the Isaflenses, the haughty savage required, in words of defiance, his name and the object of his expedition.
 As soon as <PERSON>Igmazen</PERSON> was satisfied that his enemy had strength and resolution to execute the fatal menace, he consented to purchase a necessary peace by the sacrifice of a guilty fugitive.
 The guards that were placed to secure the person of <ORG>Firmus</ORG> deprived him of the hopes of escape, and the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> tyrant, after wine had extinguished the sense of danger, disappointed the insulting triumph of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by strangling himself in the night.
 His dead body, the only present which <PERSON>Igmazen</PERSON> could offer to the conqueror, was carelessly thrown upon a camel; and Theodosius, leading back his victorious troops to Sitifi, was saluted by the warmest acclamations of joy and loyalty.

 376 <LOC>Africa</LOC> had been lost by the vices of <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> it was restored by the virtues of Theodosius, and our curiosity may be usefully directed to the inquiry of the respective treatment which the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals received from the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court.
 The authority of Count <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> had been suspended by the master-general of the cavalry, and he was committed to safe and honourable custody till the end of the war.
 His crimes were proved by the most authentic evidence, and the public expected, with some impatience, the decree of severe justice.
 But the partial and powerful favour of <PERSON>Mellobaudes</PERSON> encouraged him to challenge his legal judges, to obtain repeated delays for the purpose of procuring a crowd of friendly witnesses, and, finally, to cover his guilty conduct by the additional guilt of fraud and forgery.
 About the same time the restorer of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Africa, on a vague suspicion that his name and services were superior to the rank of a subject, was ignominiously beheaded at Carthage.
 <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> no longer reigned; and the death of Theodosius, as well as the impunity of Romanus, may justly be imputed to the arts of the ministers who abused the confidence and deceived the inexperienced youth of his sons.
(124) State of <LOC>Africa</LOC> If the geographical accuracy of <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> had been fortunately bestowed on the <NORP>British</NORP> exploits of Theodosius, we should have traced, with eager curiosity, the distinct and domestic footsteps of his march.
 But the tedious enumeration of the unknown and uninteresting tribes of <LOC>Africa</LOC> may be reduced to the general remark, that they were all of the swarthy race of the Moors; that they inhabited the back settlements of the <NORP>Mauritanian</NORP> and <NORP>Numidian</NORP> provinces, the country, as they have since been termed by the Arabs, of dates and of locusts,(125) and that, as the <NORP>Roman</NORP> power declined in Africa, the boundary of civilised manners and cultivated land was insensibly contracted.
 Beyond the utmost limits of the Moors, the vast and inhospitable desert of the <LOC>South</LOC> extends above a thousand miles to the banks of the Niger.
 The ancients, who had a very faint and imperfect knowledge of the great peninsula of Africa, were sometimes tempted to believe that the torrid zone must ever remain destitute of inhabitants;(126) and they sometimes amused their fancy by filling the vacant space with headless men, or rather monsters,(127) with horned and cloven-footed satyrs,(128) with fabulous centaurs,(129) and with human pigmies, who waged a bold and doubtful warfare against the cranes.
 (130) <GPE>Carthage</GPE> would have trembled at the strange intelligence that the countries on either side of the equator were filled with innumerable nations who differed only in their colour from the ordinary appearance of the human species; and the subjects of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have anxiously expected that the swarms of barbarians which issued from the <LOC>North</LOC> would soon be encountered from the <LOC>South</LOC> by new swarms of barbarians, equally fierce and equally formidable.
 These gloomy terrors would indeed have been dispelled by a more intimate acquaintance with the character of their <NORP>African</NORP> enemies.
 The inaction of the negroes does not seem to be the effect either of their virtue or of their pusillanimity.
 They indulge, like the rest of mankind, their passions and appetites and the adjacent tribes are engaged in frequent acts of hostility.
 (131) But their rude ignorance has never invented any effectual weapons of defence or of destruction; they appear incapable of forming any extensive plans of government or conquest; and the obvious inferiority of their mental faculties has been discovered and abused by the nations of the temperate zone.
 Sixty thousand blacks are annually embarked from the coast of Guinea, never to return to their native country; but they are embarked in chains;(132) and this constant emigration which in the space of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> centuries might have furnished armies to overrun the globe, accuses the guilt of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and the weakness of Africa.
 The EAST.
 The <NORP>Persian</NORP> War.
 A.
D.
 365-378 IV.
 The ignominious treaty which saved the army of <NORP>Jovian</NORP> had been faithfully executed on the side of the Romans; and as they had solemnly renounced the sovereignty and alliance of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and Iberia, those tributary <GPE>Kingdoms</GPE> were exposed, without protection, to the arms of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch.
(133) <ORG>Sapor</ORG> entered the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> territories at the head of a formidable host of cuirassiers, of archers, and of mercenary foot; but it was the invariable practice of <ORG>Sapor</ORG> to mix war and negotiation, and to consider falsehood and perjury as the most powerful instruments of regal policy.
 He affected to praise the prudent and moderate conduct of the king of Armenia; and the unsuspicious <PERSON>Tiranus</PERSON> was persuaded, by the repeated assurances of insidious friendship, to deliver his person into the hands of a faithless and cruel enemy.
 In the midst of a splendid entertainment, he was bound in chains of silver, as an honor due to the blood of the Arsacides; and, after a short confinement in the Tower of Oblivion at Ecbatana, he was released from the miseries of life, either by his own dagger or by that of an assassin.
 The kingdom of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> was reduced to the state of a <NORP>Persian</NORP> province; the administration was shared between a distinguished satrap and a favourite eunuch; and <ORG>Sapor</ORG> marched, without delay, to subdue the martial spirit of the Iberians.
 Sauromaces, who reigned in that country by the permission of the emperors, was expelled by a superior force, and, as an insult on the majesty of Rome, the king of kings placed a diadem on the head of his abject vassal Aspacuras.
 The city of Artogerassa(134) was the only place of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> which presumed to resist the effort of his arms.
 The treasure deposited in that strong fortress tempted the avarice of Sapor; but the danger of Olympias, the wife or widow of the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> king, excited the public compassion and animated the desperate valour of her subjects and soldiers.
 The <NORP>Persians</NORP> were surprised and repulsed under the walls of <PERSON>Artogerassa</PERSON> by a bold and well-concerted sally of the besieged.
 But the forces of <ORG>Sapor</ORG> were continually renewed and increased; the hopeless courage of the garrison was exhausted; the strength of the walls yielded to the assault; and the proud conqueror, after wasting the rebellious city with fire and sword, led away captive an unfortunate queen, who, in a more auspicious hour, had been the destined bride of the son of Constantine.
(135) Yet if <ORG>Sapor</ORG> already triumphed in the easy conquest of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> dependent kingdoms, he soon felt that a country is unsubdued as long as the minds of the people are actuated by an hostile and contumacious spirit.
 The satraps, whom he was obliged to trust, embraced the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> opportunity of regaining the affection of their countrymen, and of signalising their immortal hatred to the <NORP>Persian</NORP> name.
 Since the conversion of the <NORP>Armenians</NORP> and Iberians, those nations considered the <NORP>Christians</NORP> as the favourites, and the <NORP>Magians</NORP> as the adversaries, of the Supreme Being; the influence of the clergy over a superstitious people was uniformly exerted in the cause of Rome; and as long as the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> disputed with those of <PERSON>Artaxerxes</PERSON> the sovereignty of the intermediate provinces, the religious connection always threw a decisive advantage into the scale of the empire.
 A numerous and active party acknowledged Para, the son of Tiranus, as the lawful sovereign of Armenia, and his title to the throne was deeply rooted in the hereditary succession of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred years.
 By the unanimous consent of the Iberians, the country was equally divided between the rival princes; and Aspacuras, who owed his diadem to the choice of Sapor, was Obliged to declare that his regard for his children, who were detained as hostages by the tyrant, was the only consideration which prevented him from openly renouncing the alliance of Persia.
 The emperor Valens, who respected the obligations of the treaty, and who was apprehensive of involving the <LOC>East</LOC> in a dangerous war, ventured with slow and cautious measures, to support the <NORP>Roman</NORP> party in the kingdoms of <GPE>Iberia</GPE> and Armenia.
 <CARDINAL>Twelve</CARDINAL> legions established the authority of <ORG>Sauromaces</ORG> on the banks of the Cyrus.
 The <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> was protected by the valour of Arintheus.
 A powerful army, under the command of Count Trajan, and of <PERSON>Vadomair</PERSON> king of the Alemanni, fixed their camp on the confines of Armenia.
 But they were strictly enjoined not to commit the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> hostilities, which might be understood as a breach of the treaty; and such was the implicit obedience of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, that they retreated, with exemplary patience, under a shower of <NORP>Persian</NORP> arrows, till they had clearly acquired a just title to an honourable and legitimate victory.
 Yet these appearances of war insensibly subsided in a vain and tedious negotiation.
 The contending parties supported their claims by mutual reproaches of perfidy and ambition; and it should seem that the original treaty was expressed in very obscure terms, since they were reduced to the necessity of making their inconclusive appeal to the partial testimony of the generals of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations who had assisted at the negotiations.
(136) The invasion of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, which soon afterwards shook the foundations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, exposed the provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> to the arms of Sapor.
 But the declining age, and perhaps the infirmities of the monarch, suggested new maxims of tranquillity and moderation.

 380His death, which happened in the full maturity of a reign of <DATE>seventy</DATE> years, changed in a moment the court and councils of Persia, and their attention was most probably engaged by domestic troubles and the distant efforts of a <NORP>Carmanian</NORP> war.
(137) The remembrance of ancient injuries was lost in the enjoyment of peace.
 The treaty of peace, A.
D.
 384.
 The kingdoms of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and <GPE>Iberia</GPE> were permitted, by the mutual though tacit consent of both empires, to resume their doubtful neutrality.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> years of the reign of Theodosius, a <NORP>Persian</NORP> embassy arrived at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to excuse the unjustifiable measures of the former reign, and to offer, as the tribute of friendship, or even of respect, a splendid present of gems, of silk, and of <NORP>Indian</NORP> elephants.
(138) Adventures of Para, king of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> In the general picture of the affairs of the <LOC>East</LOC> under the reign of Valens, the adventures of <PERSON>Para</PERSON> form <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most striking and singular objects.
 The noble youth, by the persuasion of his mother Olympias, had escaped through the <NORP>Persian</NORP> host that besieged Artogerassa, and implored the protection of the emperor of the East.
 By his timid councils, <PERSON>Para</PERSON> was alternately supported, and recalled, and restored, and betrayed.
 The hopes of the <NORP>Armenians</NORP> were sometimes raised by the presence of their natural sovereign, and the ministers of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> were satisfied that they preserved the integrity of the public faith, if their vassal was not suffered to assume the diadem and title of King.
 But they soon repented of their own rashness.
 They were confounded by the reproaches and threats of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch.
 They found reason to distrust the cruel and inconstant temper of <PERSON>Para</PERSON> himself, who sacrificed, to the slightest suspicions, the lives of his most faithful servants, and held a secret and disgraceful correspondence with the assassin of his father and the enemy of his country.
 Under the specious pretence of consulting with the emperor on the subject of their common interest, <PERSON>Para</PERSON> was persuaded to descend from the mountains of Armenia, where his party was in arms, and to trust his independence and safety to the discretion of a perfidious court.
 The king of Armenia, for such he appeared in his own eyes and in those of his nation, was received with due honours by the governors of the provinces through which he passed but when he arrived at <GPE>Tarsus</GPE> in Cilicia, his progress was stopped under various pretences, his motions were watched with respectful vigilance, and he gradually discovered that he was a prisoner in the hands of the Romans.
 <PERSON>Para</PERSON> suppressed his indignation, dissembled his fears, and, after secretly preparing his escape, mounted on horseback with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred of his faithful followers.
 The officer stationed at the door of his apartment immediately communicated his flight to the consular of Cilicia, who overtook him in the suburbs, and endeavoured, without success, to dissuade him from prosecuting his rash and dangerous design.
 A legion was ordered to pursue the royal fugitive; but the pursuit of infantry could not be very alarming to a body of light cavalry; and upon the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> cloud of arrows that was discharged into the air, they retreated with precipitation to the gates of Tarsus.
 After an incessant march of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nights, <PERSON>Para</PERSON> and his <NORP>Armenians</NORP> reached the banks of the Euphrates; but the passage of the river, which they were obliged to swim, was attended with some delay and some loss.
 The country was alarmed, and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> roads, which were only separated by an interval of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles, had been occupied by a thousand archers on horseback, under the command of a count and a tribune.
 <PERSON>Para</PERSON> must have yielded to superior force, if the accidental arrival of a friendly traveller had not revealed the danger and the means of escape.
 A dark and almost impervious path securely conveyed the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> troops through the thicket; and <PERSON>Para</PERSON> had left behind him the count and the tribune, while they patiently expected his approach along the public highways.
 They returned to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court to excuse their want of diligence or success; and seriously alleged that the king of Armenia, who was a skilful magician, had transformed himself and his followers, and passed before their eyes under a borrowed shape.
 After his return to his native kingdom, <PERSON>Para</PERSON> still continued to profess himself the friend and ally of the Romans: but the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had injured him too deeply ever to forgive, and the secret sentence of his death was signed in the council of Valens.
 The execution of the bloody deed was committed to the subtle prudence of Count Trajan, and he had the merit of insinuating himself into the confidence of the credulous prince, that he might find an opportunity of stabbing him to the heart.
 <PERSON>Para</PERSON> was invited to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> banquet, which had been prepared with all the pomp and sensuality of the East; the hall resounded with cheerful music, and the company was already heated with wine, when the count retired for an instant, drew his sword, and gave the signal of the murder.
 A robust and desperate barbarian instantly rushed on the king of Armenia, and though he bravely defended his life with the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> weapon that chance offered to A.

his hand, the table of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general was stained with the royal blood of a guest and an ally.
 Such were the weak and wicked maxims of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> administration, that, to attain a doubtful object of political interest, the laws of nations, and the sacred rights of hospitality, were inhumanly violated in the face of the world.
(139) V THE DANUBE.
 Conquests of <PERSON>Hermanric</PERSON> V.
During a peaceful interval of thirty years, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> secured their frontiers, and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> extended their dominions.
 The victories of the great Hermanric,(140) king of the Ostrogoths, and the most noble of the race of the Amali, have been compared, by the enthusiasm of his countrymen, to the exploits of Alexander: with this singular, and almost incredible, difference, that the martial spirit of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero, instead of being supported by the vigour of youth, was displayed with glory and success in the extreme period of human life, between the age of four-score and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years.
 The independent tribes were persuaded, or compelled, to acknowledge the king of the <NORP>Ostrogoths</NORP> as the sovereign of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation: the chiefs of the Visigoths, or Thervingi, renounced the royal title, and assumed the more humble appellation of judges; and, among those judges, Athanaric, Fritigern, and <PERSON>Alavivus</PERSON> were the most illustrious, by their personal merit, as well as by their vicinity to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces.
 These domestic conquests, which increased the military power of Hermanric, enlarged his ambitious designs.
 He invaded the adjacent countries of the North, and <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> considerable nations, whose names and limits cannot be accurately defined, successively yielded to the superiority of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms.
 (141) The Heruli, who inhabited the marshy lands near the lake Maeotis, were renowned for their strength and agility; and the assistance of their light infantry was eagerly solicited, and highly esteemed, in all the wars of the barbarians.
 But the active spirit of the <PERSON>Heruli</PERSON> was subdued by the slow and steady perseverance of the Goths; and, after a bloody action, in which the king was slain, the remains of that warlike tribe became an useful accession to the camp of Hermanric.
 He then marched against the Venedi; unskilled in the use of arms, and formidable only by their numbers, which filled the wide extent of the plains of modern Poland.
 The victorious Goths, who were not inferior in numbers, prevailed in the contest, by the decisive advantages of exercise and discipline.
 After the submission of the Venedi, the conqueror advanced, without resistance, as far as the confines of the Aestii,(142) an ancient people, whose name is still preserved in the province of Esthonia.
 Those distant inhabitants of the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> coast were supported by the labors of agriculture, enriched by the trade of amber, and consecrated by the peculiar worship of the Mother of the Gods.
 But the scarcity of iron obliged the <NORP>Aestian</NORP> warriors to content themselves with wooden clubs; and the reduction of that wealthy country is ascribed to the prudence, rather than to the arms, of Hermanric.
 His dominions, which extended from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the Baltic, included the native seats, and the recent acquisitions, of the Goths; and he reigned over the greatest part of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and <GPE>Scythia</GPE> with the authority of a conqueror, and sometimes with the cruelty of a tyrant.
 But he reigned over a part of the globe incapable of perpetuating and adorning the glory of its heroes.
 The name of <PERSON>Hermanric</PERSON> is almost buried in oblivion; his exploits are imperfectly known: and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves appeared unconscious of the progress of an aspiring power which threatened the liberty of the <LOC>North</LOC> and the peace of the empire.
(143) The cause of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war, A.
D.
 366 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> had contracted an hereditary attachment for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> house of Constantine, of whose power and liberality they had received so many signal proofs.
 They respected the public peace; and if an hostile band sometimes presumed to pass the <NORP>Roman</NORP> limit, their irregular conduct was candidly ascribed to the ungovernable spirit of the barbarian youth.
 Their contempt for <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> new and obscure princes, who had been raised to the throne by a popular election, inspired the <NORP>Goths</NORP> with bolder hopes; and, while they agitated some design of marching their confederate force under the national standard,(144) they were easily tempted to embrace the party of Procopius, and to foment, by their dangerous aid, the civil discord of the Romans.
 The public treaty might stipulate no more than <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand auxiliaries; but the design was so zealously adopted by the chiefs of the Visigoths, that the army which passed the <LOC>Danube</LOC> amounted to the number of thirty thousand men.
(145) They marched with the proud confidence that their invincible valour would decide the fate of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire; and the provinces of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> groaned under the weight of the barbarians, who displayed the insolence of masters, and the licentiousness of enemies.
 But the intemperance which gratified their appetites retarded their progress; and before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> could receive any certain intelligence of the defeat and death of Procopius, they perceived, by the hostile state of the country, that the civil and military powers were resumed by his successful rival.
 A chain of posts and fortifications, skilfully disposed by Valens, or the generals of Valens, resisted their march, prevented their retreat, and intercepted their subsistence.
 The fierceness of the barbarians was tamed and suspended by hunger; they indignantly threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror who offered them food and chains: the numerous captives were distributed in all the cities of the East; and the provincials, who were soon familiarised with their savage appearance, ventured, by degrees, to measure their own strength with these formidable adversaries, whose name had so long been the object of their terror.
 The king of <GPE>Scythia</GPE> (and <PERSON>Hermanric</PERSON> alone could deserve so lofty a title) was grieved and exasperated by this national calamity.
 His ambassadors loudly complained, at the court of Valens, of the infraction of the ancient and solemn alliance which had so long subsisted between the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Goths.
 They alleged that they had fulfilled the duty of allies, by assisting the kinsman and successor of the emperor Julian; they required the immediate restitution of the noble captives; and they urged a very singular claim, that the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> generals, marching in arms, and in hostile array, were entitled to the sacred character and privileges of ambassadors.
 The decent, but peremptory, refusal of these extravagant demands was signified to the barbarians by Victor, master-general of the cavalry, who expressed, with force and dignity, the just complaints of the emperor of the East.
(146) The negotiation was interrupted, and the manly exhortations of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> encouraged his timid brother to vindicate the insulted majesty of the empire.
(147) Hostilities and peace, A.
D.
 367, 368, 369.
 The splendour and magnitude of this <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war are celebrated by a contemporary historian;(148) but the events scarcely deserve the attention of posterity, except as the preliminary steps of the approaching decline and fall of the empire.
 Instead of leading the nations of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and <GPE>Scythia</GPE> to the banks of the Danube, or even to the gates of Constantinople, the aged monarch of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> resigned to the brave <PERSON>Athanaric</PERSON> the danger and glory of a defensive war, against an enemy who wielded with a feeble hand the powers of a mighty state.
 A bridge of boats was established upon the Danube, the presence of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> animated his troops, and his ignorance of the art of war was compensated by personal bravery, and a wise deference to the advice of <PERSON>Victor</PERSON> and Arintheus, his masters-general of the cavalry and infantry.
 The operations of the campaign were conducted by their skill and experience; but they found it impossible to drive the <PERSON>Visigoths</PERSON> from their strong posts in the mountains, and the devastation of the plains obliged the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves to repass the <LOC>Danube</LOC> on the approach of winter.
 The incessant rains, which swelled the waters of the river, produced a tacit suspension of arms, and confined the emperor Valens, during the whole course of the ensuing summer, to his camp of Marcianopolis.
 The <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> year of the war was more favourable to the Romans, and more pernicious to the Goths.
 The interruption of trade deprived the barbarians of the objects of luxury, which they already confounded with the necessaries of life; and the desolation of a very extensive tract of country threatened them with the horrors of famine.
 <PERSON>Athanaric</PERSON> was provoked, or compelled, to risk a battle, which he lost, in the plains; and the pursuit was rendered more bloody by the cruel precaution of the victorious generals, who had promised a large reward for the head of every <PERSON>Goth</PERSON> that was brought into the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp.
 The submission of the barbarians appeased the resentment of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> and his council: the emperor listened with satisfaction to the flattering and eloquent remonstrance of the senate of Constantinople, which assumed, for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time, a share in the public deliberations; and the same generals, <PERSON>Victor</PERSON> and Arintheus, who had successfully directed the conduct of the war, were empowered to regulate the conditions of peace.
 The freedom of trade which the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had hitherto enjoyed was restricted to <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> cities on the Danube; the rashness of their leaders was severely punished by the suppression of their pensions and subsidies; and the exception, which was stipulated in favour of <PERSON>Athanaric</PERSON> alone, was more advantageous than honourable to the Judge of the Visigoths.
 Athanaric, who, on this occasion, appears to have consulted his private interest, without expecting the orders of his sovereign, supported his own dignity, and that of his tribe, in the personal interview which was proposed by the ministers of Valens.
 He persisted in his declaration that it was impossible for him, without incurring the guilt of perjury, ever to set his foot on the territory of the empire; and it is more than probable that his regard for the sanctity of an oath was confirmed by the recent and fatal examples of <NORP>Roman</NORP> treachery.
 The Danube, which separated the dominions of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> independent nations, was chosen for the scene of the conference.
 The emperor of the East, and the Judge of the Visigoths, accompanied by an equal number of armed followers, advanced in their respective barges to the middle of the stream.
 After the ratification of the treaty, and the delivery of hostages, <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> returned in triumph to Constantinople, and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> remained in a state of tranquillity about six years, till they were violently impelled against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire by an innumerable host of Scythians, who appeared to issue from the frozen regions of the North.
(149) War of the <NORP>Quadi</NORP> and Sarmatians, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>374</CARDINAL> The emperor of the West, who had resigned to his brother the command of the Lower Danube, reserved for his immediate care the defence of the <NORP>Rhaetian</NORP> and <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> provinces, which spread so many hundred miles along the greatest of the <NORP>European</NORP> rivers.
 The active policy of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was continually employed in adding new fortifications to the security of the frontier; but the abuse of this policy provoked the just resentment of the barbarians.
 The <NORP>Quadi</NORP> complained that the ground for an intended fortress had been marked out on their territories, and their complaints were urged with so much reason and moderation, that Equitius, master-general of Illyricum, consented to suspend the prosecution of the work till he should be more clearly informed of the will of his sovereign.
 This fair occasion of injuring a rival, and of advancing the fortune of his son, was eagerly embraced by the inhuman Maximin, the praefect, or rather tyrant, of Gaul.
 The passions of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> were impatient of control, and he credulously listened to the assurances of his favourite, that, if the government of Valeria, and the direction of the work, were intrusted to the zeal of his son Marcellinus, the emperor should no longer be importuned with the audacious remonstrances of the barbarians.
 The subjects of Rome, and the natives of Germany, were insulted by the arrogance of a young and worthless minister, who considered his rapid elevation as the proof and reward of his superior merit.
 He affected, however, to receive the modest application of Gabinius, king of the Quadi, with some attention and regard; but this artful civility concealed a dark and bloody design, and the credulous prince was persuaded to accept the pressing invitation of Marcellinus.
 I am at a loss how to vary the narrative of similar crimes; or how to relate that, in the course of the same year, but in remote parts of the empire, the inhospitable table of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Imperial</NORP> generals was stained with the royal blood of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> guests and allies, inhumanly murdered by their order, and in their presence.
 The fate of Gabinius, and of Para, was the same: but the cruel death of their sovereign was resented in a very different manner by the servile temper of the <NORP>Armenians</NORP> and the free and daring spirit of the Germans.
 The <NORP>Quadi</NORP> were much declined from that formidable power which in the time of Marcus Antoninus, had spread terror to the gates of Rome.
 But they still possessed arms and courage; their courage was animated by despair, and they obtained the usual reinforcement of the cavalry of their <NORP>Sarmatian</NORP> allies.
 So improvident was the assassin Marcellinus, that he chose the moment when the bravest veterans had been drawn away to suppress the revolt of Firmus, and the whole province was exposed, with a very feeble defence, to the rage of the exasperated barbarians.
 They invaded <GPE>Pannonia</GPE> in the season of harvest, unmercifully destroyed every object of plunder which they could not easily transport, and either disregarded or demolished the empty fortifications.
 The princess Constantia, the daughter of the emperor Constantius, and the grand-daughter of the great Constantine, very narrowly escaped.
 That royal maid, who had innocently supported the revolt of Procopius, was now the destined wife of the heir of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 She traversed the peaceful province with a splendid and unarmed train.
 Her person was saved from danger, and the republic from disgrace, by the active zeal of Messalla, governor of the provinces.
 As soon as he was informed that the village where she stopped only to dine was almost encompassed by the barbarians, he hastily placed her in his own chariot, and drove full speed till he reached the gates of Sirmium, which were at the distance of six-and-twenty miles.
 Even <ORG>Sirmium</ORG> might not have been secure if the <NORP>Quadi</NORP> and <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> had diligently advanced during the general consternation of the magistrates and people.
 Their delay allowed Probus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, sufficient time to recover his own spirits and to revive the courage of the citizens.
 He skilfully directed their strenuous efforts to repair and strengthen the decayed fortifications, and procured the seasonable and effectual assistance of a company of archers to protect the capital of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> provinces.
 Disappointed in their attempts against the walls of Sirmium, the indignant barbarians turned their arms against the master-general of the frontier, to whom they unjustly attributed the murder of their king.
 <PERSON>Equitius</PERSON> could bring into the field no more than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> legions, but they contained the veteran strength of the <NORP>Maesian</NORP> and <NORP>Pannonian</NORP> bands.
 The obstinacy with which they disputed the vain honours of rank and precedency was the cause of their destruction, and, while they acted with separate forces and divided councils, they were surprised and slaughtered by the active vigour of the <NORP>Sarmatian</NORP> horse.
 The success of this invasion provoked the emulation of the bordering tribes, and the province of <GPE>Masia</GPE> would infallibly have been lost if young Theodosius, the duke or military commander of the frontier, had not signalised, in the defeat of the public enemy, an intrepid genius worthy of his illustrious father and of his future greatness.
(150) The expedition, A.
D.
 375, The mind of Valentinian, who then resided at Treves, was deeply affected by the calamities of Illyricum, but the lateness of the season suspended the execution of his designs till the ensuing spring.
 He marched in person, with a considerable part of the forces of Gaul, from the banks of the Moselle; and to the suppliant ambassadors of the Sarmatians, who met him on the way, he returned a doubtful answer, that as soon as he reached the scene of action he should examine and pronounce.
 When he arrived at <ORG>Sirmium</ORG> he gave audience to the deputies of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> provinces, who loudly congratulated their own felicity under the auspicious government of Probus, his <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect.
 (151) Valentinian, who was flattered by these demonstrations of their loyalty and gratitude, imprudently asked the deputy of Epirus, a <NORP>Cynic</NORP> philosopher of intrepid sincerity, (152) whether he was freely sent by the wishes of the province? The emperor paused, but the impunity of his ministers established the pernicious maxim that they might oppress his subjects without injuring his service.
 A strict inquiry into their conduct would have relieved the public discontent.
 The severe condemnation of the murder of <PERSON>Gabinius</PERSON> was the only measure which could restore the confidence of the Germans, and vindicate the honour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name.
 But the haughty monarch was incapable of the magnanimity which dares to acknowledge a fault.
 He forgot the provocation, remembered only the injury, and advanced into the country of the <NORP>Quadi</NORP> with an insatiate thirst of blood and revenge.
 The extreme devastation and promiscuous massacre of a savage war were justified in the eyes of the emperor, and perhaps in those of the world, by the cruel equity of retaliation; (153) and such was the discipline of the Romans, and the consternation of the enemy, that <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> repassed the <LOC>Danube</LOC> without the loss of a single man.
 As he had resolved to complete the destruction of the <NORP>Quadi</NORP> by a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> campaign, he fixed his <DATE>winter-quarters</DATE> at Bregetio, on the Danube, near the <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> city of Presburg.
 While the operations of war were suspended by the severity of the weather, the <NORP>Quadi</NORP> made an humble attempt to deprecate the wrath of their conqueror, and, at the earnest persuasion of Equitius, their ambassadors were introduced into the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> council.
 They approached the throne with bended bodies and dejected countenances, and, without daring to complain of the murder of their king, they affirmed, with solemn oaths, that the late invasion was the crime of some irregular robbers, which the public council of the nation condemned and abhorred.
 The answer of the emperor left them but little hope from his clemency or compassion.
 He reviled, in the most intemperate language, their baseness, their ingratitude, their insolence.
 His eyes, his voice, his colour, his gestures, expressed the violence of his ungoverned fury; and while his whole frame was agitated with convulsive passion a large blood-vessel suddenly burst in his body, and <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> fell speechless into the arms of his attendants.
 and death, of Valentinian, A.
D.
 375, November 17th.
 Their pious care immediately concealed his situation from the crowd, but in a few minutes the emperor of the <LOC>West</LOC> expired in an agony of pain, retaining his senses till the last, and struggling, without success, to declare his intentions to the generals and ministers who surrounded the royal couch.
 <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was about fifty-four years of age, and he wanted only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred days to accomplish the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years of his reign.
(154) The emperors Gratian, and <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> II The polygamy of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> is seriously attested by an ecclesiastical historian.
(155) But we may be assured, from the evidence of reason as well as history, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> marriages of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> with <PERSON>Severa</PERSON> and with <PERSON>Justina</PERSON> were successively contracted, and that he used the ancient permission of divorce, which was still allowed by the laws, though it was condemned by the church.
 <PERSON>Severa</PERSON> was the mother of Gratian, who seemed to unite every claim which could entitle him to the undoubted succession of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 He was the eldest son of a monarch whose glorious reign had confirmed the free and honourable choice of his fellow-soldiers.
 Before he had attained the ninth year of his age the royal youth received from the hands of his indulgent father the purple robe and diadem, with the title of Augustus; the election was solemnly ratified by the consent and applause of the armies of Gaul,(156) and the name of <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> was added to the names of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> and <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> in all the legal transactions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 By his marriage with the grand-daughter of Constantine, the son of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> acquired all the hereditary rights of the <NORP>Flavian</NORP> family, which, in a series of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <NORP>Imperial</NORP> generations, were sanctified by time, religion, and the reverence of the people.
 At the death of his father the royal youth was in the seventeenth year of his age, and his virtues already justified the favourable opinion of the army and people.
 But <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> resided, without apprehension, in the palace of Treves, whilst at the distance of many hundred miles <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> suddenly expired in the camp of Bregetio.
 The passions which had been so long suppressed by the presence of a master immediately revived in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> council, and the ambitious design of reigning in the name of an infant was artfully executed by <PERSON>Mellobaudes</PERSON> and Equitius, who commanded the attachment of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> and <NORP>Italian</NORP> bands.
 They contrived the most honour able pretences to remove the popular leaders and the troops of Gaul, who might have asserted the claims of the lawful successor; they suggested the necessity of extinguishing the hopes of foreign and domestic enemies by a bold and decisive measure.
 The empress Justina, who had been left in a palace about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles from Bregetio, was respectfully invited to appear in the camp with the son of the deceased emperor.
 On the sixth day after the death of Valentinian, the infant prince of the same name, who was only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years old, was shown, in the arms of his mother, to the legions, and solemnly invested, by military acclamation, with the titles and ensigns of supreme power.
 The impending dangers of a civil war were seasonably prevented by the wise and moderate conduct of the emperor Gratian.
 He cheerfully accepted the choice of the army, declared that he should always consider the son of <PERSON>Justina</PERSON> as a brother, not as a rival, and advised the empress, with her son Valentinian, to fix their residence at Milan, in the fair and peaceful province of <GPE>Italy</GPE> while he assumed the more arduous command of the countries beyond the Alps.
 <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> dissembled his resentment till he could safely punish or disgrace the authors of the conspiracy; and though he uniformly behaved with tenderness and regard to his infant colleague, he gradually confounded, in the administration of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, the office of a guardian with the authority of a sovereign.
 The government of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world was exercised in the united names of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> and his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nephews; but the feeble emperor of the East, who succeeded to the rank of his elder brother, never obtained any weight or influence in the councils of the West.
