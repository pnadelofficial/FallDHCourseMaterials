Conduct of the army and senate after the death of Aurelian.
 Reigns of Tacitus, Probus, and Carus, and his sons.
 Extraordinary contest between the army and the senate for the choice of an emperor.
 SUCH was the unhappy condition of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors, that, whatever might be their conduct, their fate was commonly the same.
 A life of pleasure or virtue, of severity or mildness, of indolence or glory, alike led to an untimely grave; and almost every reign is closed by the same disgusting repetition of treason and murder.
 The death of Aurelian, however, is remarkable by its extraordinary consequences.
 The legions admired, lamented, and revenged their victorious chief.
 The artifice of his perfidious secretary was discovered and punished.
 The deluded conspirators attended the funeral of their injured sovereign with sincere, or well-feigned contrition, and submitted to the unanimous resolution of the military order, which was signified by the following epistle:, The <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators heard, without surprise, that another emperor had been assassinated in his camp; they secretly rejoiced in the fall of Aurelian; but the modest and dutiful address of the legions, when it was communicated in full assembly by the consul, diffused the most pleasing astonishment.
 Such honours as fear and perhaps esteem could extort they liberally poured forth on the memory of their deceased sovereign.
 Such acknowledgments as gratitude could inspire they returned to the faithful armies of the republic, who entertained so just a sense of the legal authority of the senate in the choice of an emperor.
 Yet, notwithstanding this flattering appeal, the most prudent of the assembly declined exposing their safety and dignity to the caprice of an armed multitude.
 The strength of the legions was, indeed, a pledge of their sincerity, since those who may command are seldom reduced to the necessity of dissembling; but could it naturally be expected that a hasty repentance would correct the inveterate habits of four-score years? Should the soldiers relapse into their accustomed seditions, their insolence might disgrace the majesty of the senate and prove fatal to the object of its choice.
 Motives like these dictated a decree by which the election of a new emperor was referred to the suffrage of the military order.

 February 3.
 A Peaceful interregnum of eight months The contention that ensued is <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the best attested but most improbable events in the history of mankind.
 (2) The troops, as if satiated with the exercise of power, again conjured the senate to invest <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of its own body with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple.
 The senate still persisted in its refusal; the army in its request.
 The reciprocal offer was pressed and rejected at least <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> times, and, whilst the obstinate modesty of either party was resolved to receive a master from the hands of the other, eight months insensibly elapsed; an amazing period of tranquil anarchy, during which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world remained without a sovereign, without an usurper, and without a sedition.
 The generals and magistrates appointed by <PERSON>Aurelian</PERSON> continued to execute their ordinary functions; and it is observed that a proconsul of <LOC>Asia</LOC> was the only considerable person removed from his office in the whole course of the interregnum.
 An event somewhat similar but much less authentic is supposed to have happened after the death of Romulus, who, in his life and character, bore some affinity with Aurelian.
 The throne was vacant during <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> months till the election of a <NORP>Sabine</NORP> philosopher, and the public peace was guarded in the same manner by the union of the several orders of the state.
 But, in the time of <PERSON>Numa</PERSON> and Romulus, the arms of the people were controlled by the authority of the Patricians; and the balance of freedom was easily preserved in a small and virtuous community.
 (3) The decline of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> state, far different from its infancy, was attended with every circumstance that could banish from an interregnum the prospect of obedience and harmony: an immense and tumultuous capital, a wide extent of empire, the servile equality of despotism, an army of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> mercenaries and the experience of frequent revolutions.
 Yet, notwithstanding all these temptations, the discipline and memory of <PERSON>Aurelian</PERSON> still restrained the seditious temper of the troops, as well as the fatal ambition of their leaders.
 The flower of the legions maintained their stations on the banks of the Bosphorus, and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> standard awed the less powerful camps of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of the provinces.
 A generous though transient enthusiasm seemed to animate the military order; and we may hope that a few real patriots cultivated the returning friendship of the army and the senate as the only expedient capable of restoring the republic to its ancient beauty and vigour.

 Sept, 25.
 The consul assembles the senate.
 On the twenty-fifth of September, near eight months after the murder of Aurelian, the consul convoked an assembly of the senate, and reported the doubtful and dangerous situation of the empire.
 He slightly insinuated that the precarious loyalty of the soldiers depended on the chance of every hour and of every accident; but he represented, with the most convincing eloquence, the various dangers that might attend any farther delay in the choice of an emperor.
 Intelligence, he said, was already received that the <NORP>Germans</NORP> had passed the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and occupied some of the strongest and most opulent cities of Gaul.
 The ambition of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> king kept the <LOC>East</LOC> in perpetual alarms; Egypt, Africa, and <PRODUCT>Illyricum</PRODUCT> were exposed to foreign and domestic arms; and the levity of <GPE>Syria</GPE> would prefer even a female sceptre to the sanctity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> laws.
 The consul then, addressing himself to Tacitus, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the senators,(4) required his opinion on the important subject of a proper candidate for the vacant throne.
 Character of Tacitus.
 If we can prefer personal merit to accidental greatness, we shall esteem the birth of <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> more truly noble than that of kings.
 He claimed his descent from the philosophic historian whose writings will instruct the last generations of mankind.
 (5) The senator <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> was then seventy-five years of age.
 (6) The long period of his innocent life was adorned with wealth and honours.
 He had twice been invested with the consular dignity, (7) and enjoyed with elegance and sobriety his ample patrimony of between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions sterling.
 (8) The experience of so many princes, whom he had esteemed or endured, from the vain follies of <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> to the useful rigour of Aurelian, taught him to form a just estimate of the duties, the dangers, and the temptations of their sublime station.
 From the assiduous study of his immortal ancestor he derived the knowledge of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution and of human nature.
 (9) The voice of the people had already named <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> as the citizen the most worthy of empire.
 The ungrateful rumour reached his ears, and induced him to seek the retirement of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his villas in Campania.
 He had passed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months in the delightful privacy of Baiae, when he reluctantly obeyed the summons of the consul to resume his honourable place in the senate, and to assist the republic with his counsels on this important occasion.
 He is elected emperor, He arose to speak, when, from every quarter of the house, he was saluted with the names of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Emperor.
 As soon as the tumult of acclamations subsided, <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> attempted to decline the dangerous honour, and to express his wonder that they should elect his age and infirmities to succeed the martial vigour of Aurelian.
 and accepts the purple.
 The reluctance of Tacitus, and it might possibly be sincere, was encountered by the affectionate obstinacy of the senate.
 Five hundred voices repeated at once, in eloquent confusion, that the greatest of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes, Numa, Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines, had ascended the throne in a very advanced <DATE>season</DATE> of life; that the mind, not the body, a sovereign, not a soldier, was the object of their choice; and that they expected from him no more than to guide by his wisdom the valour of the legions.
 These pressing though tumultuary instances were seconded by a more regular oration of Metius Falconius, the next on the consular bench to <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> himself.
 He reminded the assembly of the evils which <GPE>Rome</GPE> had endured from the vices of headstrong and capricious youths, congratulated them on the election of a virtuous and experienced senator, and with a manly, though perhaps a selfish, freedom, exhorted <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> to remember the reasons of his elevation, and to seek a successor, not in his own family, but in the republic.
 The speech of <PERSON>Falconius</PERSON> was enforced by a general acclamation.
 The emperor elect submitted to the authority of his country, and received the voluntary homage of his equals.
 The judgment of the senate was confirmed by the consent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people and of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards.
 (11) Authority of the senate, The administration of <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> was not unworthy of his life and principles.
 A grateful servant of the senate, he considered that national council as the author, and himself as the subject, of the laws.
 (12) He studied to heal the wounds which <NORP>Imperial</NORP> pride, civil discord, and military violence had inflicted on the constitution, and to restore, at least, the image of the ancient republic as it had been preserved by the policy of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and the virtues of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> and the Antonines.
 It may not be useless to recapitulate some of the most important prerogatives which the senate appeared to have regained by the election of Tacitus.
 (13) 1/.
 To invest <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their body, under the title of emperor, with the general command of the armies and the government of the frontier provinces.
 2/.
 To determine the list, or, as it was then styled, the College of Consuls.
 They were <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> in number, who, in successive pairs, each during the space of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months, filled the year, and represented the dignity of that ancient office.
 The authority of the senate, in the nomination of the consuls, was exercised with such independent freedom, that no regard was paid to an irregular request of the emperor in favour of his brother Florianus.
 3/.
 To appoint the proconsuls and presidents of the provinces, and to confer on all the magistrates their civil jurisdiction.
 4/.
 To receive appeals through the intermediate office of the praefect of the city from all the tribunals of the empire.
 5/.
 To give force and validity, by their decrees, to such as they should approve of the emperor's edicts.
 6/.
 To these several branches of authority we may add some inspection over the finances, since, even in the stern reign of Aurelian, it was in their power to divert a part of the revenue from the public service.
 (14) Their joy and confidence.
 Circular epistles were sent, without delay, to all the principal cities of the empire—Treves, Milan, Aquileia, Thessalonica, Corinth, Athens, Antioch, Alexandria, and Carthage—to claim their obedience, and to inform them of the happy revolution which had restored the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate to its ancient dignity.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> of these epistles are still extant.
 We likewise possess <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> very singular fragments of the private correspondence of the senators on this occasion.
 They discover the most excessive joy and the most unbounded hopes.
 These lofty expectations were, however, soon disappointed; nor, indeed, was it possible that the armies and the provinces should long obey the luxurious and unwarlike nobles of Rome.
 On the slightest touch the unsupported fabric of their pride and power fell to the ground.
 The expiring senate displayed a sudden lustre, blazed for a moment, and was extinguished for ever.

 <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> is acknowledged by the army.
 All that had yet passed at <GPE>Rome</GPE> was no more than a theatrical representation, unless it was ratified by the more substantial power of the legions.
 Leaving the senators to enjoy their dream of freedom and ambition, <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> proceeded to the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> camp, and was there by the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, presented to the assembled troops as the prince whom they themselves had demanded, and whom the senate had bestowed.
 As soon as the praefect was silent the emperor addressed himself to the soldiers with eloquence and propriety.
 He gratified their avarice by a liberal distribution of treasure under the names of pay and donative.
 He engaged their esteem by a spirited declaration that, although his age might disable him from the performance of military exploits, his counsels should never be unworthy of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, the successor of the brave Aurelian.
 (16) The <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> invade Asia, and are repulsed by Tacitus.
 Whilst the deceased emperor was making preparations for a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> expedition into the East, he had negotiated with the Alani, a <NORP>Scythian</NORP> people, who pitched their tents in the neighbourhood of the lake Maetis.
 Those barbarians, allured by presents and subsidies, had promised to invade <GPE>Persia</GPE> with a numerous body of light cavalry.
 They were faithful to their engagements; but when they arrived on the <NORP>Roman</NORP> frontier <PERSON>Aurelian</PERSON> was already dead, the design of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war was at least suspended, and the generals who, during the interregnum, exercised a doubtful authority, were unprepared either to receive or to oppose them.
 Provoked by such treatment, which they considered as trifling and perfidious, the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> had recourse to their own valour for their payment and revenge; and as they moved with the usual swiftness of Tartars, they had soon spread themselves over the provinces of Pontus, Cappadocia, Cilicia, and Galatia.
 The legions who, from the opposite shores of the Bosphorus, could almost distinguish the flames of the cities and villages impatiently urged their general to lead them against the invaders.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> was suitable to his age and station.
 He convinced the barbarians of the faith, as well as of the power, of the empire.
 Great numbers of the Alani, appeased by the punctual discharge of the engagements which <PERSON>Aurelian</PERSON> had contracted with them, relinquished their booty and captives, and quietly retreated to their own deserts beyond the Phasis.
 Against the remainder, who refused peace, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor waged, in person, a successful war.
 Seconded by an army of brave and experienced veterans, in a few weeks he delivered the provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> from the terror of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> invasion.
 (17) Death of the emperor Tacitus.
 But the glory and life of <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> were of short duration.
 Transported in the depth of winter from the soft retirement of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the foot of Mount Caucasus, he sunk under the unaccustomed hardships of a military life.
 The fatigues of the body were aggravated by the cares of the mind.
 For a while the angry and selfish passions of the soldiers had been suspended by the enthusiasm of public virtue.
 They soon broke out with redoubled violence, and raged in the camp, and even in the tent of the aged emperor.
 His mild and amiable character served only to inspire contempt, and he was incessantly tormented with factions which he could not assuage, and by demands which it was impossible to satisfy.
 Whatever flattering expectations he had conceived of reconciling the public disorders, <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> soon was convinced that the licentiousness of the army disdained the feeble restraint of laws, and his last hour was hastened by anguish and disappointment.
 It may be doubtful whether the soldiers imbrued their hands in the blood of this innocent prince.
 (18) It is certain that their insolence was the cause of his death.
 He expired at <GPE>Tyana</GPE> in Cappadocia, after a reign of only six months and about twenty days.
 (19) .
Usurpation and death of his brother <PERSON>Florianus</PERSON> The eyes of <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> were scarcely closed before his brother <PERSON>Florianus</PERSON> showed himself unworthy to reign by the hasty usurpation of the purple, without expecting the approbation of the senate.
 The reverence for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution, which yet influenced the camp and the provinces, was sufficiently strong to dispose them to censure, but not to provoke them to oppose, the precipitate ambition of Florianus.
 The discontent would have evaporated in idle murmurs, had not the general of the East, the heroic Probus, boldly declared himself the avenger of the senate.
 The contest, however, was still unequal; nor could the most able leader, at the head of the effeminate troops of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Syria, encounter, with any hopes of victory, the legions of Europe, whose irresistible strength appeared to support the brother of Tacitus.
 But the fortune and activity of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> triumphed over every obstacle.
 The hardy veterans of his rival, accustomed to cold climates, sickened and consumed away in the sultry heats of Cilicia, where the summer proved remarkably unwholesome.
 Their numbers were diminished by frequent desertion, the passes of the mountains were feebly defended; <GPE>Tarsus</GPE> opened its gates; and the soldiers of Florianus, when they had permitted him to enjoy the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> title about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months, delivered the empire from civil war by the easy sacrifice of a prince whom they despised.
 (20) Their family subsists in obscurity.
 The perpetual revolutions of the throne had so perfectly erased every notion of hereditary right, that the family of an unfortunate emperor was incapable of exciting the jealousy of his successors.
 The children of <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Florianus</PERSON> were permitted to descend into a private station, and to mingle with the general mass of the people.
 Their poverty indeed became an additional safeguard to their innocence.
 When <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> was elected by the senate he resigned his ample patrimony to the public service,(21) an act of generosity specious in appearance, but which evidently disclosed his intention of transmitting the empire to his descendants.
 The only consolation of their fallen state was the remembrance of transient greatness, and a distant hope, the child of a flattering prophecy, that, at the end of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years, a monarch of the race of <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> should arise, the protector of the senate, the restorer of Rome, and the conqueror of the whole earth.
 (22) Character and elevation of the emperor Probus.
 The peasants of Illyricum, who had already given <PERSON>Claudius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Aurelian</PERSON> to the sinking empire, had an equal right to glory in the elevation of Probus.
 (23) Above twenty years before, the emperor Valerian, with his usual penetration, had discovered the rising merit of the young soldier, on whom he conferred the rank of tribune long before the age prescribed by the military regulations.
 The tribune soon justified his choice by a victory over a great body of Sarmatians, in which he saved the life of a near relation of Valerian; and deserved to receive from the emperor's hand the collars, bracelets, spears, and banners, the mural and the civic crown, and all the honourable rewards reserved by ancient <GPE>Rome</GPE> for successful valour.
 The third, and afterwards the tenth, legion were intrusted to the command of Probus, who, in every step of his promotion, showed himself superior to the station which he filled.
 <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Pontus, the Rhine, the Danube, the Euphrates, and the Nile, by turns afforded him the most splendid occasions of displaying his personal prowess and his conduct in war.
 <PERSON>Aurelian</PERSON> was indebted to him for the conquest of Egypt, and still more indebted for the honest courage with which he often checked the cruelty of his master.
 Tacitus, who desired by the abilities of his generals to supply his own deficiency of military talents, named him commander-in-chief of all the eastern provinces, with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times the usual salary, the promise of the consulship, and the hope of a triumph.
 When <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> ascended the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> throne he was about forty-four years of age ;(24) in the full possession of his fame, of the love of the army, and of a mature vigour of mind and body.
 His respectful conduct towards the senate.
 His acknowledged merit, and the success of his arms against Florianus, left him without an enemy or a competitor.
 Yet, if we may credit his own professions, very far from being desirous of the empire, he had accepted it with the most sincere reluctance.
 His dutiful address to the senate displayed the sentiments, or at least the language, of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> patriot: When this respectful epistle was read by the consul, the senators were unable to disguise their satisfaction that <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> should condescend thus humbly to solicit a sceptre which he already possessed.
 They celebrated with the warmest gratitude his virtues, his exploits, and above all his moderation.
 A decree immediately passed, without a dissenting voice to ratify the election of the eastern armies, and to confer on their chief all the several branches of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity; the names of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Augustus, the title of Father of his country, the right of making in the same day <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> motions in the senate,(27) the office of Pontifex Maximus, the tribunitian power, and the proconsular command; a mode of investiture which, though it seemed to multiply the authority of the emperor, expressed the constitution of the ancient republic.
 The reign of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> corresponded with this fair beginning.
 The senate was permitted to direct the civil administration of the empire.
 Their faithful general asserted the honour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms, and often laid at their feet crowns of gold and barbaric trophies, the fruits of his numerous victories.
 (28) Yet, whilst he gratified their vanity, he must secretly have despised their indolence and weakness.
 Though it was every moment in their power to repeal the disgraceful edict of Gallienus, the proud successors of the <PERSON>Scipios</PERSON> patiently acquiesced in their exclusion from all military employments.
 They soon experienced that those who refuse the sword must renounce the sceptre.
 Victories of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> over the barbarians.
 The strength of <PERSON>Aurelian</PERSON> had crushed on every side the enemies of Rome.
 After his death they seemed to revive with an increase of fury and of numbers.
 They were again vanquished by the active vigour of Probus, who, in a short reign of about six years, (29) equalled the fame of ancient heroes, and restored peace and order to every province of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The dangerous frontier of <GPE>Rhaetia</GPE> he so firmly secured that he left it without the suspicion of an enemy.
 He broke the wandering power of the <NORP>Sarmatian</NORP> tribes, and by the terror of his arms compelled those barbarians to relinquish their spoil.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation courted the alliance of so warlike an emperor.
 (30) He attacked the <NORP>Isaurians</NORP> in their mountains, besieged and took several of their strongest castles, (31) and flattered himself that he had for ever suppressed a domestic foe whose independence so deeply wounded the majesty of the empire.
 The troubles excited by the usurper <PRODUCT>Firmus</PRODUCT> in the Upper <GPE>Egypt</GPE> had never been perfectly appeased, and the cities of <GPE>Ptolemais</GPE> and Coptos, fortified by the alliance of the <PERSON>Blemmyes</PERSON> still maintained an obscure rebellion.
 The chastisement of those cities, and of their auxiliaries the savages of the South, is said to have alarmed the court of Persia,(32) and the Great King sued in vain for the friendship of Probus.
 Most of the exploits which distinguished his reign were achieved by the personal valour and conduct of the emperor, insomuch that the Writer of his Life expresses some amazement how, in so short a time, a single man could be present in so many distant wars.
 The remaining actions he intrusted to the care of his lieutenants, the judicious choice of whom forms no inconsiderable part of his glory.
 Carus, Diocletian, Maximian, Constantius, Galerius, Asclepiodatus, Annibalianus, and a crowd of other chiefs, who afterwards ascended or supported the throne, were trained to arms in the severe school of <PERSON>Aurelian</PERSON> and Probus.
 (33) He delivers <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> from the invasion of the Germans, But the most important service which <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> rendered to the republic was the deliverance of Gaul, and the recovery of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> flourishing cities oppressed by the barbarians of <GPE>Germany</GPE> who, since the death of Aurelian, had ravaged that great province with impunity.
 (34) Among the various multitude of those fierce invaders, we may distinguish, with some degree of clearness, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> great armies, or rather nations, successively vanquished by the valour of Probus.
 He drove back the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> into their morasses; a descriptive circumstance from whence we may infer that the confederacy known by the manly appellation of <PERSON>Free</PERSON> already occupied the flat maritime country, intersected and almost overflown by the stagnating waters of the Rhine, and that several tribes of the <NORP>Frisians</NORP> and <NORP>Batavians</NORP> had acceded to their alliance.
 He vanquished the Burgundians, a considerable people of the <NORP>Vandalic</NORP> race.
 They had wandered in quest of booty from the banks of the <LOC>Oder</LOC> to those of the Seine.
 They esteemed themselves sufficiently fortunate to purchase, by the restitution of all their booty, the permission of an undisturbed retreat.
 They attempted to elude that article of the treaty.
 Their punishment was immediate and terrible.
 (35) But of all the invaders of Gaul, the most formidable were the Lygians, a distant people who reigned over a wide domain on the frontiers of <GPE>Poland</GPE> and Silesia.
 (36) In the <PERSON>Lygian</PERSON> nation the <PERSON>Arii</PERSON> held the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rank by their numbers and fierceness.
 Yet the arms and discipline of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> easily discomfited these horrid phantoms.
 The <PERSON>Lygii</PERSON> were defeated in a general engagement, and Semno, the most renowned of their chiefs, fell alive into the hands of Probus.
 That prudent emperor, unwilling to reduce a brave people to despair, granted them an honourable capitulation, and permitted them to return in safety to their native country.
 But the losses which they suffered in the march, the battle, and the retreat, broke the power of the nation: nor is the <PERSON>Lygian</PERSON> name ever repeated in the history either of <GPE>Germany</GPE> or of the empire.
 The deliverance of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> is reported to have cost the lives of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the invaders; a work of labour to the Romans, and of expense to the emperor, who gave a piece of gold for the head of every barbarian.
 (39) But as the fame of warriors is built on the destruction of human kind, we may naturally suspect that the sanguinary account was multiplied by the avarice of the soldiers, and accepted without any very severe examination by the liberal vanity of Probus.
 and carries his arms into Germany.
 Since the expedition of Maximin, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals had confined their ambition to a defensive war against the nations of Germany, who perpetually pressed on the frontiers of the empire.
 The more daring <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> pursued his <NORP>Gallic</NORP> victories, passed the Rhine, and displayed his invincible eagles on the banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and the Neckar.
 He was fully convinced that nothing could reconcile the minds of the barbarians to peace, unless they experienced in their own country the calamities of war.
 Germany, exhausted by the ill-success of the last emigration, was astonished by his presence.
 <CARDINAL>Nine</CARDINAL> of the most considerable princes repaired to his camp, and fell prostrate at his feet.
 Such a treaty was humbly received by the <NORP>Germans</NORP> as it pleased the conqueror to dictate.
 He exacted a strict restitution of the effects and captives which they had carried away from the provinces; and obliged their own magistrates to punish the more obstinate robbers who presumed to detain any part of the spoil.
 A considerable tribute of corn, cattle, and horses, the only wealth of barbarians, was reserved for the use of the garrisons which <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> established on the limits of their territory.
 He even entertained some thoughts of compelling the <NORP>Germans</NORP> to relinquish the exercise of arms, and to trust their differences to the justice, their safety to the power, of Rome.
 To accomplish these salutary ends, the constant residence of an <NORP>Imperial</NORP> governor, supported by a numerous army, was indispensably requisite.
 <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> therefore judged it more expedient to defer the execution of so great a design; which was indeed rather of specious than solid utility.
 (40) Had <GPE>Germany</GPE> been reduced into the state of a province, the Romans, with immense labour and expense, would have acquired only a more extensive boundary to defend against the fiercer and more active barbarians of Scythia.
 He builds a wall from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Danube.
 Instead of reducing the warlike natives of <GPE>Germany</GPE> to the condition of subjects, <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> contented himself with the humble expedient of raising a bulwark against their inroads.
 The country which now forms the circle of <GPE>Swabia</GPE> had been left desert in the age of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> by the emigration of its ancient inhabitants.
 (41) The fertility of the soil soon attracted a new colony from the adjacent provinces of Gaul.
 Crowds of adventurers, of a roving temper and of desperate fortunes, occupied the doubtful possession, and acknowledged, by the payment of tithes, the majesty of the empire.
 (42) To protect these new subjects, a line of frontier garrisons was gradually extended from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Danube.
 About the reign of Hadrian, when that mode of defence began to be practised, these garrisons were connected and covered by a strong entrenchment of trees and palisades.
 In the place of so rude a bulwark, the emperor <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> constructed a stone wall of a considerable height and strengthened it by towers at convenient distances.
 From the neighbourhood of <GPE>Neustadt</GPE> and <GPE>Ratisbon</GPE> on the Danube, it stretched across hills, valleys, rivers, and morasses, as far as <GPE>Wimpfen</GPE> on the Neckar, and at length terminated on the banks of the Rhine, after a winding course of near <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 (43) This important barrier, uniting the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> mighty streams that protected the provinces of Europe, seemed to fill up the vacant space through which the barbarians, and particularly the Alemanni, could penetrate with the greatest facility into the heart of the empire.
 But the experience of the world, from <GPE>China</GPE> to Britain, has exposed the vain attempt of fortifying any extensive tract of country.
 (44) An active enemy, who can select and vary his points of attacks, must in the end discover some feeble spot, or some unguarded moment.
 The strength, as well as the attention, of the defenders is divided; and such are the blind effects of terror on the firmest troops that a line broken in a single place is almost instantly deserted.
 The fate of the wall which <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> erected may confirm the general observation.
 Within a few years after his death it was overthrown by the Alemanni.
 Its scattered ruins, universally ascribed to the power of the Daemon, now serve only to excite the wonder of the <NORP>Swabian</NORP> peasant.
 Introduction and settlement of the barbarians.
 Among the useful conditions of peace imposed by <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> on the vanquished nations of <GPE>Germany</GPE> was the obligation of supplying the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army with sixteen <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> recruits, the bravest and most robust of their youth.
 The emperor dispersed them through all the provinces, and distributed this dangerous reinforcement, in small bands of fifty or sixty each, among the national troops; judiciously observing that the aid which the republic derived from the barbarians should be felt but not seen.
 (45) Their aid was now become necessary.
 The feeble elegance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the internal provinces could no longer support the weight of arms.
 The hardy frontier of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and <LOC>Danube</LOC> still produced minds and bodies equal to the labours of the camp; but a perpetual series of wars had gradually diminished their numbers.
 The infrequency of marriage, and the ruin of agriculture, affected the principles of population, and not only destroyed the strength of the present, but intercepted the hope of future generations.
 The wisdom of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> embraced a great and beneficial plan of replenishing the exhausted frontiers by new colonies of captive or fugitive barbarians, on whom he bestowed lands, cattles instruments of husbandry, and every encouragement that might engage them to educate a race of soldiers for the service of the republic.
 Into Britain, and most probably into Cambridgeshire, (46) he transported a considerable body of Vandals.
 The impossibility of an escape reconciled them to their situation, and in the subsequent troubles of that island they approved themselves the most faithful servants of the state.
 (47) Great numbers of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gepidae</PERSON> were settled on the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the Rhine.
 An hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Bastarnae, expelled from their own country, cheerfully accepted an establishment in Thrace, and soon imbibed the manners and sentiments of <NORP>Roman</NORP> subjects.
 (48) But the expectations of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> were too often disappointed.
 The impatience and idleness of the barbarians could ill-brook the slow labours of agriculture.
 Their unconquerable love of freedom, rising against despotism, provoked them into hasty rebellions, alike fatal to themselves and to the provinces.
 (49) Nor could these artificial supplies, however repeated by succeeding emperors, restore the important limit of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <PRODUCT>Illyricum</PRODUCT> to its ancient and native vigour.
 Daring enterprise of the Franks.
 Of all the barbarians who abandoned their new settlements, and disturbed the public tranquillity, a very small number returned to their own country.
 For a short <DATE>season</DATE> they might wander in arms through the empire, but in the end they were surely destroyed by the power of warlike emperor.
 The successful rashness of a party of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> was attended, however, with such memorable consequences that it ought not be passed unnoticed.
 They had been established by <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> on the seacoast of Pontus, with a view of strengthening the frontier against the inroads of the Alani.
 A fleet stationed in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the harbours of the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> fell into the hands of the Franks; and they resolved, through unknown seas, to explore their way from the mouth of the <PRODUCT>Phasis</PRODUCT> to that of the Rhine.
 They easily escaped through the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> and the Hellespont, and, cruising along the Mediterranean, indulged their appetite for revenge and plunder by frequent descents on the unsuspecting shores of Asia, Greece, and Africa.
 The opulent city of Syracuse, in whose port the navies of <GPE>Athens</GPE> and <GPE>Carthage</GPE> had formerly been sunk, was sacked by a handful of barbarians, who massacred the greatest part of the trembling inhabitants.
 From the island of <LOC>Sicily</LOC> the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> proceeded to the Columns of Hercules, trusted themselves to the ocean, coasted round <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, and, steering their triumphant course through the British Channel, at length finished their surprising voyage by landing in safety on the <NORP>Batavian</NORP> or <NORP>Frisian</NORP> shores.
 (50) The example of their success, instructing their countrymen to conceive the advantages and to despise the dangers of the sea, pointed out to their enterprising spirit a new road to wealth and glory.
 Revolt of <GPE>Saturninus</GPE> in the East; Notwithstanding the vigilance and activity of Probus, it was almost impossible that he could at once contain in obedience every part of his wide-extended dominions.
 The barbarians who broke their chains had seized the favourable opportunity of a domestic war.
 When the emperor marched to the relief of Gaul, he devolved the command of the <LOC>East</LOC> on Saturninus.
 That general, a man of merit and experience, was driven into rebellion by the absence of his sovereign, the levity of the <NORP>Alexandrian</NORP> people, the pressing instances of his friends and his own fears; but from the moment of his elevation he never entertained a hope of empire or even of life.
 But as the former part of his prediction was verified by the victory, so the latter was disappointed by the clemency, of Probus.
 That amiable prince attempted even to save the unhappy <GPE>Saturninus</GPE> from the fury of the soldiers.
 He had more than once solicited the usurper himself to place some confidence in the mercy of a sovereign who so highly esteemed his character that he had punished as a malicious informer the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who related the improbable news of his defection.
 (52) <GPE>Saturninus</GPE> might perhaps have embraced the generous offer had he not been restrained by the obstinate distrust of his adherents.
 Their guilt was deeper, and their hopes more sanguine, than those of their experienced leader.
 revolt of <PERSON>Bonosus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Proculus</PERSON> in Gaul.
 The revolt of <GPE>Saturninus</GPE> was scarcely extinguished in the <LOC>East</LOC> before new troubles were excited in the <LOC>West</LOC> by the rebellion of <PERSON>Bonosus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Proculus</PERSON> in Gaul.
 The most distinguished merit of those <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> officers was their respective prowess, of the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> in the combats of Bacchus, of the other in those of Venus, (53) yet neither of them were destitute of courage and capacity, and both sustained with honour the august character which the fear of punishment had engaged them to assume, till they sunk at length beneath the superior genius of Probus.
 He used the victory with his accustomed moderation, and spared the fortunes as well as the lives of their innocent families.
 (54) Triumph of the emperor Probus.
 The arms of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> had now suppressed all the foreign and domestic enemies of the state.
 His mild but steady administration confirmed the re-establishment of the public tranquillity; nor was there left in the provinces a hostile barbarian, a tyrant, or even a robber, to revive the memory of past disorders.
 It was time that the emperor should revisit Rome, and celebrate his own glory and the general happiness.
 The triumph due to the valour of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> was conducted with a magnificence suitable to his fortune; and the people, who had so lately admired the trophies of Aurelian, gazed with equal pleasure on those of his heroic successor.
 (55) We cannot on this occasion forget the desperate courage of about fourscore gladiators, reserved, with near six hundred others, for the inhuman sports of the amphitheatre.
 Disdaining to shed their blood for the amusement of the populace, they killed their keepers, broke from the place of their confinement, and filled the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> with blood and confusion.
 After an obstinate resistance, they were overpowered and cut in pieces by the regular forces; but they obtained at least an honourable death, and the satisfaction of a just revenge.
 (56) His discipline.
 The military discipline which reigned in the camps of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> was less cruel than that of Aurelian, but it was equally rigid and exact.
 .
The latter had punished the irregularities of the soldiers with unrelenting severity, the former prevented them by employing the legions in constant and useful labours.
 When <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> commanded in Egypt, he executed many considerable works for the splendour and benefit of that rich country.
 The navigation of the Nile, so important to <GPE>Rome</GPE> itself, was improved; and temples, bridges, porticoes, and palaces, were constructed by the hands of the soldiers, who acted by turns as architects, as engineers, and as husbandmen.
 (57) It was reported of <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> that, in order to preserve his troops from the dangerous temptations of idleness, he had obliged them to form large plantations of olive-trees along the coast of Africa.
 (58) From a similar principle, <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> exercised his legions in covering with rich vineyards the hills of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Pannonia, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> considerable spots are described which were entirely dug and planted by military labour.
 (59) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of these, known under the name of Mount Alma, was situated near Sirmium, the country where <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> was born, for which he ever retained a partial affection, and whose gratitude he endeavoured to secure, by converting into tillage a large and unhealthy tract of marshy ground.
 An army thus employed constituted perhaps the most useful as well as the bravest portion of <NORP>Roman</NORP> subjects.
 His death.
 But, in the prosecution of a favourite scheme, the best of men, satisfied with the rectitude of their intentions, are subject to forget the bounds of moderation, nor did <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> himself sufficiently consult the patience and disposition of his fierce legionaries.
 (60) The dangers of the military profession seem only to be compensated by a life of pleasure and idleness; but if the duties of the soldier are incessantly aggravated by the labours of the peasant, he will at last sink under the intolerable burden or shake it off with indignation.
 The imprudence of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> is said to have inflamed the discontent of his troops.
 More attentive to the interests of mankind than to those of the army, he expressed the vain hope that, by the establishment of universal peace, he should soon abolish the necessity of a standing and mercenary force.
 (61) The unguarded expression proved fatal to him.
 In <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the hottest days of summer, as he severely urged the unwholesome labour of draining the marshes of Sirmium, the soldiers, impatient of fatigue, on a sudden threw down their tools, grasped their arms, and broke out into a furious mutiny.
 The emperor, conscious of his danger, took refuge in a lofty tower constructed for the purpose of surveying the progress of the work.
 (62) The tower was instantly forced, and a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> swords were plunged at once into the bosom of the unfortunate Probus.
 The rage of the troops subsided as soon as it had been gratified.
 They then lamented their fatal rashness, forgot the severity of the emperor whom they had massacred, and hastened to perpetuate, by an honourable monument, the memory of his virtues and victories.
 (63) Election and character of Carus.
 When the legions had indulged their grief and repentance for the death of Probus, their unanimous consent declared Carus, his <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, the most deserving of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> throne.
 Every circumstance that relates to this prince appears of a mixed and doubtful nature.
 He gloried in the title of <NORP>Roman</NORP> Citizen; and affected to compare the purity of his blood with the foreign and even barbarous, origin of the preceding emperors; yet the most inquisitive of his contemporaries, very far from admitting his claim, have variously deduced his own birth, or that of his parents, from Illyricum, from Gaul, or from Africa.
 (64) Though a soldier, he had received a learned education; though a senator, he was invested with the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> dignity of the army; and in an age when the civil and military professions began to be irrecoverably separated from each other, they were united in the person of Carus.
 Notwithstanding the severe justice which he exercised against the assassins of Probus, to whose favour and esteem he was highly indebted, he could not escape the suspicion of being accessory to a deed from whence he derived the principal advantage.
 He enjoyed, at least before his elevation, an acknowledged character of virtue and abilities; (65) but his austere temper insensibly degenerated into moroseness and cruelty; and the imperfect writers of his life almost hesitate whether they shall not rank him in the number of <NORP>Roman</NORP> tyrants.
 (66) When <PERSON>Carus</PERSON> assumed the purple he was about sixty years of age, and his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, <PERSON>Carinus</PERSON> and Numerian, had already attained the <DATE>season</DATE> of manhood.
 (67) The sentiments of the senate and people.
 The authority of the senate expired with Probus; nor was the repentance of the soldiers displayed by the same dutiful regard for the civil power which they had testified after the unfortunate death of Aurelian.
 The election of <PERSON>Carus</PERSON> was decided without expecting the approbation of the senate, and the new emperor contented himself with announcing, in a cold and stately epistle, that he had ascended the vacant throne.
 (68) A behaviour so very opposite to that of his amiable predecessor afforded no favourable presage of the new reign: and the Romans, deprived of power and freedom, asserted their privilege of licentious murmurs.
 (69) The voice of congratulation and flattery was not however silent; and we may still peruse, with pleasure and contempt, an eclogue which was composed on the accession of the emperor Carus.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> shepherds, avoiding the noontide heat, retire into the cave of Faunus.
 On a spreading beech they discover some recent characters.
 The rural deity had described, in prophetic verses, the felicity promised to the empire under the reign of so great a prince.
 <PERSON>Faunus</PERSON> hails the approach of that hero, who, receiving on his shoulders the sinking weight of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, shall extinguish war and faction, and once again restore the innocence and security of the golden age.
 (70) <PERSON>Carus</PERSON> defeats the Sarmatians, and marches into the East;.
 It is more than probable that these elegant trifles never reached the ears of a veteran general who, with the consent of the legions, was preparing to execute the long suspended design of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war.
 Before his departure for this distant expedition, <PERSON>Carus</PERSON> conferred on his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, <PERSON>Carinus</PERSON> and Numerian, the title of Caesar, and, investing the former with almost an equal share of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> power, directed the young prince <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to suppress some troubles which had arisen in Gaul, and afterwards to fix the seat of his residence at Rome, and to assume the government of the Western provinces.
 (71) The safety of <PRODUCT>Illyricum</PRODUCT> was confirmed by a memorable defeat of the Sarmatians; sixteen <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of those barbarians remained on the field of battle, and the number of captives amounted to twenty thousand.
 The old emperor, animated with the fame and prospect of victory, pursued his march, in the midst of winter, through the countries of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, and at length, with his younger son Numerian, arrived on the confines of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarchy.
 There, encamping on the summit of a lofty mountain, he pointed out to his troops the opulence and luxury of the enemy whom they were about to invade.
 He gives audience to the <NORP>Pesian</NORP> ambassadors.
 The successor of Artaxerxes, Varanes, or Bahram, though he had subdued the Segestans, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most warlike nations of Upper Asia,(72) was alarmed at the approach of the Romans, and endeavoured to retard their progress by a negotiation of peace.
 His ambassadors entered the camp about sunset, at the time when the troops were satisfying their hunger with a frugal repast.
 The <NORP>Persians</NORP> expressed their desire of being introduced to the presence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 They were at length conducted to a soldier who was seated on the grass.
 A piece of stale bacon and a few hard peas composed his supper.
 A coarse woollen garment of purple was the only circumstance that announced his dignity.
 The conference was conducted with the same disregard of courtly elegance.
 Carus, taking off a cap which he wore to conceal his baldness, assured the ambassadors that, unless their master acknowledged the superiority of Rome, he would speedily render <GPE>Persia</GPE> as naked of trees as his own head was destitute of hair.
 (73) Notwithstanding some traces of art and preparation, we may discover in this scene the manners of Carus, and the severe simplicity which the martial princes who succeeded <ORG>Gallienus</ORG> had already restored in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> camps.
 The ministers of the Great King trembled and retired.
 His victories and extraordinary death.
 The threats of <PERSON>Carus</PERSON> were not without effect.
 He ravaged Mesopotamia, cut in pieces whatever opposed his passage, made himself master of the great cities of <GPE>Seleucia</GPE> and <PERSON>Ctesiphon</PERSON> (which seem to have surrendered without resistance), and carried his victorious arms beyond the Tigris.
 (74) He had seized the favourable moment for an invasion.
 The <NORP>Persian</NORP> councils were distracted by domestic factions, and the greater part of their forces were detained on the frontiers of India.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> received with transport the news of such important advantages.
 Flattery and hope painted in the most lively colours the fall of Persia, the conquest of Arabia, the submission of Egypt, and a lasting deliverance from the inroads of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> nations.
 (75) But the reign of <PERSON>Carus</PERSON> was destined to expose the vanity of predictions.
 They were scarcely uttered before they were contradicted by his death; an event attended with such ambiguous circumstances that it may be related in a letter from his own secretary to the praefect of the city.
 He is succeeded by his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons <PERSON>Carinus</PERSON> and Numerian.
 The vacancy of the throne was not productive of any disturbance.
 The ambition of the aspiring generals was checked by their mutual fears; and young Numerian, with his absent brother Carinus, were unanimously acknowledged as <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors.
 The public expected that the successor of <PERSON>Carus</PERSON> would pursue his father's footsteps, and, without allowing the <NORP>Persians</NORP> to recover from their consternation, would advance sword in hand to the palaces of <PERSON>Susa</PERSON> and Ecbatana.
 (77) But the legions, however strong in numbers and discipline, were dismayed by the most abject superstition.
 Notwithstanding all the arts that were practised to disguise the manner of the late emperor's death, it was found impossible to remove the opinion of the multitude, and the power of opinion is irresistible.
 Places or persons struck with lightning were considered by the ancients with pious horror, as singularly devoted to the wrath of Heaven.
 (78) An oracle was remembered which marked the river <LOC>Tigris</LOC> as the fatal boundary of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms.
 The troops, terrified with the fate of <PERSON>Carus</PERSON> and with their own danger, called aloud on young <PERSON>Numerian</PERSON> to obey the will of the gods, and to lead them away from this inauspicious scene of war.
 The feeble emperor was unable to subdue their obstinate prejudice, and the <NORP>Persians</NORP> wondered at the unexpected retreat of a victorious enemy.
 (79) Vices of Carinus.
 The intelligence of the mysterious fate of the late emperor was soon carried from the frontiers of <GPE>Persia</GPE> to Rome; and the senate, as well as the provinces, congratulated the accession of the sons of Carus.
 These fortunate youths were strangers, however, to that conscious superiority, either of birth or of merit, which can alone render the possession of a throne easy, and as it were natural.
 Born and educated in a private station, the election of their father raised them at once to the rank of princes; and his death, which happened about sixteen months afterwards, left them the unexpected legacy of a vast empire.
 To sustain with temper this rapid elevation, an uncommon share of virtue and prudence was requisite; and Carinus, the elder of the brothers, was more than commonly deficient in those qualities.
 In the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> war he discovered some degree of personal courage;(80) but from the moment of his arrival at <GPE>Rome</GPE> he abandoned himself to the luxury of the capital, and to the abuse of his fortune.
 He was soft, yet cruel; devoted to pleasure, but destitute of taste; and, though exquisitely susceptible of vanity, indifferent to the public esteem.
 In the course of a few months he successively married and divorced <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> wives, most of whom he left pregnant; and, notwithstanding this legal inconstancy, found time to indulge such a variety of irregular appetites as brought dishonour on himself and on the noblest houses of Rome.
 He beheld with inveterate hatred all those who might remember his former obscurity, or censure his present conduct.
 He banished or put to death the friends and counsellors whom his father had placed about him to guide his inexperienced youth; and he persecuted with the meanest revenge his schoolfellows and companions who had not sufficiently respected the latent majesty of the emperor.
 With the senators <PERSON>Carinus</PERSON> affected a lofty and regal demeanour, frequently declaring that he designed to distribute their estates among the populace of Rome.
 From the dregs of that populace he selected his favourites, and even his ministers.
 The palace, and even the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> table, was filled with singers, dancers, prostitutes, and all the various retinue of vice and folly.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of his doorkeepers(81) he intrusted with the government of the city.
 In the room of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, whom he put to death, <PERSON>Carinus</PERSON> substituted <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ministers of his looser pleasures.
 Another, who possessed the same or even a more infamous title to favour, was invested with the consulship.
 A confidential secretary, who had acquired uncommon skill in the art of forgery, delivered the indolent emperor, with his own consent, from the irksome duty of signing his name.
 When the emperor <PERSON>Carus</PERSON> undertook the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war, he was induced, by motives of affection as well as policy, to secure the fortunes of his family by leaving in the hands of his eldest son the armies and provinces of the West.
 The intelligence which he soon received of the conduct of <PERSON>Carinus</PERSON> filled him with shame and regret; nor had he concealed his resolution of satisfying the republic by a severe act of justice, and of adopting, in the place of an unworthy son, the brave and virtuous Constantius, who at that time was governor of Dalmatia.
 But the elevation of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was for a while deferred; and as soon as the father's death had released <PERSON>Carinus</PERSON> from the control of fear or decency, he displayed to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> the extravagancies of Elagabalus, aggravated by the cruelty of Domitian.
 (82) He celebrates the <NORP>Roman</NORP> games.
 The only merit of the administration of <PERSON>Carinus</PERSON> that history could record, or poetry celebrate, was the uncommon splendour with which, in his own and his brother's name, he exhibited the <NORP>Roman</NORP> games of the theatre, the circus, and the amphitheatre.
 More than twenty years afterwards, when the courtiers of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> represented to their frugal sovereign the name and popularity of his munificent predecessor, he acknowledged that the reign of <PERSON>Carinus</PERSON> had indeed been a reign of pleasure.
 (83) But this vain prodigality, which the prudence of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> might justly despise, was enjoyed with surprise and transport by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 The oldest of the citizens, recollecting the spectacles of former days, the triumphal pomp of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> or Aurelian, and the secular games of the emperor Philip, acknowledged that they were all surpassed by the superior magnificence of Carinus.
 (84) Spectacles of Rome.
 The spectacles of <PERSON>Carinus</PERSON> may therefore be best illustrated by the observation of some particulars which history has condescended to relate concerning those of his predecessors.
 If we confine ourselves solely to the hunting of wild beasts, however we may censure the vanity of the design or the cruelty of the execution, we are obliged to confess that neither before nor since the time of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> so much art and expense have ever been lavished for the amusement of the people.
 (85) By the order of Probus, a great quantity of large trees, torn up by the roots, were transplanted into the midst of the circus.
 The spacious and shady forest was immediately filled with a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> ostriches, a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> stags, a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fallow-deer, and a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> wild boars; and all this variety of game was abandoned to the riotous impetuosity of the multitude.
 The tragedy of the succeeding day consisted in the massacre of an hundred lions, an equal number of lionesses, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred leopards, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred bears.
 (86) The collection prepared by the younger <PERSON>Gordian</PERSON> for his triumph, and which his successor exhibited in the secular games, was less remarkable by the number than by the singularity of the animals.
 <CARDINAL>Twenty</CARDINAL> zebras displayed their elegant forms and variegated beauty to the eyes of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 (87) <CARDINAL>Ten</CARDINAL> elks, and as many camelopards, the loftiest and most harmless creatures that wander over the plain of <GPE>Sarmatia</GPE> and Ethiopia, were contrasted with <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <NORP>African</NORP> hyenas and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <NORP>Indian</NORP> tigers, the most implacable savages of the torrid zone.
 The unoffending strength with which <ORG>Nature</ORG> has endowed the greater quadrupeds was admired in the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus of the Nile,(88) and a majestic troop of <CARDINAL>twenty-two</CARDINAL> elephants.
 (89) While the populace gazed with stupid wonder on the splendid show, the naturalist might indeed observe the figure and properties of so many different species, transported from every part of the ancient world into the amphitheatre of Rome.
 But this accidental benefit which science might derive from folly is surely insufficient to justify such a wanton abuse of the public riches.
 There occurs, however, a single instance in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Punic war in which the senate wisely connected this amusement of the multitude with the interest of the state.
 A considerable number of elephants, taken in the defeat of the <NORP>Carthaginian</NORP> army, were driven through the circus by a few slaves, armed only with blunt javelins.
 (90) The useful spectacle served to impress the <NORP>Roman</NORP> soldier with a just contempt for those unwieldy animals; and he no longer dreaded to encounter them in the ranks of war.
 The amphitheatre.
 The hunting or exhibition of wild beasts was conducted with a magnificence suitable to a people who styled themselves the masters of the world; nor was the edifice appropriated to that entertainment less expensive of <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 Posterity admires, and will long admire, the awful remains of the amphitheatre of <PERSON>Titus</PERSON> who so well deserved the epithet of Colossal.
 (91) It was a building of an elliptic figure, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty-four feet in length, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty-seven in breadth, founded on fourscore arches, and rising, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> successive orders of architecture, to the height of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty feet.
 (92) The outside of the edifice was encrusted with marble and decorated with statues.
 The slopes of the vast concave, which formed the inside, were filled and surrounded with sixty or eighty rows of seats, of marble likewise, covered with cushions, and capable of receiving with ease above fourscore <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> spectators.
 (93) <CARDINAL>Sixty-four</CARDINAL> vomitories (for by that name the doors were very aptly distinguished) poured forth the immense multitude; and the entrances, passages, and staircases were contrived with such exquisite skill, that each person, whether of the senatorial, the equestrian, or the plebeian order, arrived at his destined place without trouble or confusion.
 (94) Nothing was omitted which, in any respect, could be subservient to the convenience and pleasure of the spectators.
 They were protected from the sun and rain by an ample canopy, occasionally drawn over their heads.
 The air was continually refreshed by the playing of fountains, and profusely impregnated by the grateful scent of aromatics.
 In the centre of the edifice, the arena, or stage, was strewed with the finest sand, and successively assumed the most different forms.
 At <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moment it seemed to rise out of the earth, like the garden of the Hesperides, and was afterwards broken into the rocks and caverns of Thrace.
 The subterraneous pipes conveyed an inexhaustible supply of water; and what had just before appeared a level plain might be suddenly converted into a wide lake, covered with armed vessels, and replenished with the monsters of the deep.
 (95) In the decoration of these scenes the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors displayed their wealth and liberality; and we read on various occasions that the whole furniture of the amphitheatre consisted either of silver, or of gold, or of amber.
 (96) The poet who describes the games of Carinus, in the character of a shepherd attracted to the capital by the fame of their magnificence, affirms that the nets designed as a defence against the wild beasts were of gold wire; that the porticoes were gilded; and that the belt or circle which divided the several ranks of spectators from each other was studded with a precious mosaic of beautiful stones.
 (97) In the midst of this glittering pageantry, the emperor Carinus, secure of his fortune, enjoyed the acclamations of the people, the flattery of his courtiers, and the songs of the poets, who, for want of a more essential merit, were reduced to celebrate the divine graces of his person.
 (98) In the same hour, but at the distance of <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> hundred miles from Rome, his brother expired; and a sudden revolution transferred into the hands of a stranger the sceptre of the house of Carus.
 (99) Return of <PERSON>Numerian</PERSON> with the army from Persia.
 The sons of <PERSON>Carus</PERSON> never saw each other after their father's death.
 The arrangements which their new situation required were probably deferred till the return of the younger brother to Rome, where a triumph was decreed to the young emperors for the glorious success of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war.
 (100) It is uncertain whether they intended to divide between them the administration or the provinces of the empire; but it is very unlikely that their union would have proved of any long duration.
 The jealousy of power must have been inflamed by the opposition of characters.
 In the most corrupt of times <PERSON>Carinus</PERSON> was unworthy to live: <PERSON>Numerian</PERSON> deserved to reign in a happier period.
 His affable manners and gentle virtues secured him, as soon as they became known, the regard and affections of the public.
 He possessed the elegant accomplishments of a poet and orator, which dignify as well as adorn the humblest and the most exalted station.
 His eloquence, however it was applauded by the senate, was formed not so much on the model of <PERSON>Cicero</PERSON> as on that of the modern declaimers; but in an age very far from being destitute of poetical merit, he contended for the prize with the most celebrated of his contemporaries, and still remained the friend of his rivals; a circumstance which evinces either the goodness of his heart, or the superiority of his genius.
 (101) But the talents of <PERSON>Numerian</PERSON> were rather of the contemplative than of the active kind.
 When his father's elevation reluctantly forced him from the shade of retirement, neither his temper nor his pursuits had qualified him for the command of armies.
 His constitution was destroyed by the hardships of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war; and he had contracted, from the heat of the climate,(102) such a weakness in his eyes, as obliged him, in the course of a long retreat, to confine himself to the solitude and darkness of a tent or litter.
 The administration of all affairs, civil as well as military, was devolved on Arrius Aper, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, who, to the power of his important office, added the honour of being father-in-law to Numerian.
 The <NORP>Imperial</NORP> pavilion was strictly guarded by his most trusty adherents; and during many days <ORG>Aper</ORG> delivered to the army the supposed mandates of their invisible sovereign.
 (103) Death of Numerian.
 It was not till eight months after the death of <PERSON>Carus</PERSON> that the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army, returning by slow marches from the banks of the Tigris, arrived on those of the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> Bosphorus.
 The legions halted at <GPE>Chalcedon</GPE> in Asia, while the court passed over to Heraclea, on the <NORP>European</NORP> side of the Propontis.
 (104) But a report soon circulated through the camp, at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> in secret whispers, and at length in loud clamours, of the emperor's death, and of the presumption of his ambitious minister, who still exercised the sovereign power in the name of a prince who was no more.
 The impatience of the soldiers could not long support a state of suspense.
 With rude curiosity they broke into the imperial tent, and discovered only the corpse of Numerian.
 (105) The gradual decline of his health might have induced them to believe that his death was natural; but the concealment was interpreted as an evidence of guilt, and the measures which <ORG>Aper</ORG> had taken to secure his election became the immediate occasion of his ruin.
 Yet, even in the transport of their rage and grief, the troops observed a regular proceeding, which proves how firmly discipline had been re-established by the martial successors of Gallienus.
 A general assembly of the army was appointed to be held at Chalcedon, whither <ORG>Aper</ORG> was transported in chains, as a prisoner and a criminal.
 A vacant tribunal was erected in the midst of the camp, and the generals and tribunes formed a great military Council.
 Election of the Emperor Diocletian, A.
D.
 284, Sept <CARDINAL>17</CARDINAL> They soon announced to the multitude that their choice had fallen on Diocletian, commander of the domestics or bodyguards, as the person the most capable of revenging and succeeding their beloved emperor.
 The future fortunes of the candidate depended on the chance or conduct of the present hour.
 Conscious that the station which he had filled exposed him to some suspicions, <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> ascended the tribunal, and, raising his eyes towards the Sun, made a solemn profession of his own innocence, in the presence of that all seeing Deity.
 (106) Then, assuming the tone of a sovereign and a judge, he commanded that Aper; should be brought in chains to the foot of the tribunal.
 and without giving him time to enter on a dangerous justification, drew his sword, and buried it in the breast of the unfortunate praefect.
 A charge supported by such decisive proof was admitted without contradiction, and the legions, with repeated acclamations, acknowledged the justice and authority of the emperor Diocletian.

 The most faithful servants of the father despised the incapacity, and dreaded the cruel arrogance of the son.
 The hearts of the people were engaged in favour of his rival, and even the senate was inclined to prefer an usurper to a tyrant.
 The arts of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> inflamed the general discontent; and the winter was employed in secret intrigues and open preparations for a civil war.
 In the spring the forces of the <LOC>East</LOC> and of the <LOC>West</LOC> encountered each other in the plains of Margus, a small city of Maesia, in the neighbourhood of the Danube.
 (108) The troops, so lately returned from the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war, had acquired their glory at the expense of health and numbers, nor were they in a condition to contend with the unexhausted strength of the legions of Europe.
 Their ranks were broken, and, for a moment, <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> despaired of the purple and of life.
 But the advantage which <PERSON>Carinus</PERSON> had obtained by the valour of his soldiers he quickly lost by the infidelity of his officers.
 A tribune, whose wife he had seduced, seized the opportunity of revenge, and by a single blow extinguished civil discord in the blood of the adulterer.
