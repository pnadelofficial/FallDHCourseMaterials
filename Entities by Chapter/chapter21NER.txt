Persecution of heresy — The Schism of the <NORP>Donatists</NORP> — The <NORP>Arian</NORP> Controversy — <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> — Distracted state of the Church and the Empire under <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and his sons — Toleration of <NORP>Paganism</NORP> THE grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince, who indulged their passions and promoted their interest.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> gave them security, wealth, honours, and revenge; and the support of the orthodox faith was considered as the most sacred and important duty of the civil magistrate.
 The edict of Milan, the great charter of toleration, had confirmed to each individual of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion.
 But this inestimable privilege was soon violated: with the knowledge of truth the emperor imbibed the maxims of persecution; and the sects which dissented from the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of Christianity.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> easily believed that the heretics, who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands, were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy; and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation.
 Not a moment was lost in excluding the ministers and teachers of the separated congregations from any share of the rewards and immunities which the emperor had so liberally bestowed on the orthodox clergy.
 But as the sectaries might still exist under the cloud of royal disgrace, the conquest of the <LOC>East</LOC> was immediately followed by an edict which announced their total destruction.
(1) After a preamble filled with passion and reproach, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> absolutely prohibits the assemblies of the heretics, and confiscates their public property to the use either of the revenue or of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 The sects against whom the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> severity was directed appear to have been the adherents of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> of Samosata; the <NORP>Montanists</NORP> of Phrygia, who maintained an enthusiastic succession of prophecy; the Novatians, who sternly rejected the temporal efficacy of repentance; the <NORP>Marcionites</NORP> and Valentinians, under whose leading banners the various <NORP>Gnostics</NORP> of <LOC>Asia</LOC> and <GPE>Egypt</GPE> had insensibly rallied; and perhaps the Manichaeans, who had recently imported from <GPE>Persia</GPE> a more artful composition of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> and <NORP>Christian</NORP> theology.
(2) The design of extirpating the name, or at least of restraining the progress, of these odious heretics, was prosecuted with vigour and effect.
 Some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of Diocletian; and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression, and had pleaded for the rights of humanity.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> immaterial circumstances may serve, however, to prove that the mind of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was not entirely corrupted by the spirit of zeal and bigotry.
 Before he condemned the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> and their kindred sects, he resolved to make an accurate inquiry into the nature of their religious principles.
 As if he distrusted the impartiality of his ecclesiastical counsellors, this delicate commission was intrusted to a civil magistrate, whose learning and moderation he justly esteemed, and of whose venal character he was probably ignorant.
 (3) The emperor was soon convinced that he had too hastily proscribed the orthodox faith and the exemplary morals of the Novatians, who had dissented from the church in some articles of discipline which were not perhaps essential to salvation.
 By a particular edict he exempted them from the general penalties of the law; (4) allowed them to build a church at Constantinople; respected the miracles of their saints; invited their bishop, Acesius, to the council of Nice; and gently ridiculed the narrow tenets of his sect by a familiar jest, which from the mouth of a sovereign must have been received with applause and gratitude.
(5) <NORP>African</NORP> Controversy, A.
D.
 312.
 The complaints and mutual accusations which assailed the throne of Constantine, as soon as the death of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> had submitted <LOC>Africa</LOC> to his victorious arms, were ill adapted to edify an imperfect proselyte.
 He learned with surprise that the provinces of that great country, from the confines of <GPE>Cyrene</GPE> to the Columns of Hercules, were distracted with religious discord.
(6) The source of the division was derived from a double election in the church of Carthage, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> in rank and opulence of the ecclesiastical thrones of the <LOC>West</LOC> <PERSON>Caecilian</PERSON> and <NORP>Majourinus</NORP> were the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rival primates of Africa; and the death of the latter soon made room for Donatus, who, by his superior abilities and apparent virtues, was the firmest support of his party.
 The advantage which <PERSON>Cacilian</PERSON> might claim from the priority of his ordination was destroyed by the illegal, or at least indecent, haste with which it had been performed, without expecting the arrival of the bishops of Numidia.
 The authority of these bishops, who, to the number of seventy, condemned Caecilian, and consecrated Majorinus, is again weakened by the infamy of some of their personal characters; and by the female intrigues, sacrilegious bargains, and tumultuous proceedings, which are imputed to this <NORP>Numidian</NORP> council.
 (7) The bishops of the contending factions maintained, with equal ardour and obstinacy, that their adversaries were degraded, or at least dishonoured, by the odious crime of delivering the Holy <WORK_OF_ART>Scriptures</WORK_OF_ART> to the officers of Diocletian.
 From their mutual reproaches, as well as from the story of this dark transaction, it may justly be inferred that the late persecution had embittered the zeal, without reforming the manners, of the <NORP>African</NORP> Christians.
 That divided church was incapable of affording an impartial judicature; the controversy was solemnly tried in <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> successive tribunals, which were appointed by the emperor; and the whole proceeding, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> appeal to the final sentence, lasted above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years.
 A severe inquisition, which was taken by the praetorian vicar and the proconsul of Africa, the report of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> episcopal visitors who had been sent to Carthage, the decrees of the councils of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of Arles, and the supreme judgment of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> himself in his sacred consistories were all favourable to the cause of Caecilian; and he was unanimously acknowledged by the civil and ecclesiastical powers as the true and lawful primate of Africa.
 The honours and estates of the church were attributed to his suffragan bishops, and it was not without difficulty that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was satisfied with inflicting the punishment of exile on the principal leaders of the <NORP>Donatist</NORP> faction.
 As their cause was examined with attention, perhaps it was determined with justice.
 Perhaps their complaint was not without foundation, that the credulity of the emperor had been abused by the insidious arts of his favourite Osius.
 The influence of falsehood and corruption might procure the condemnation of the innocent, or aggravate the sentence of the guilty.
 Such an act, however, of injustice, if it concluded an importunate dispute, might be numbered among the transient evils of a despotic administration, which are neither felt nor remembered by posterity.
 Schism of the Donatists, A.
D.
 315.
 But this incident, so inconsiderable that it scarcely deserves a place in history, was productive of a memorable schism, which afflicted the provinces of <LOC>Africa</LOC> above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, and was extinguished only with <NORP>Christianity</NORP> itself.
 The inflexible zeal of freedom and fanaticism animated the <NORP>Donatists</NORP> to refuse obedience to the usurpers, whose election they disputed, and whose spiritual powers they denied.
 Excluded from the civil and religious communion of mankind, they boldly excommunicated the rest of mankind who had embraced the impious party of Caecilian, and of the Traditors, from whom he derived his pretended ordination.
 They asserted with confidence, and almost with exultation, that the <NORP>Apostolical</NORP> succession was interrupted; that all the bishops of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism; and that the prerogatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the <NORP>African</NORP> believers, who alone had preserved inviolate the integrity of their faith and discipline.
 This rigid theory was supported by the most uncharitable conduct.
 Whenever they acquired a proselyte, even from the distant provinces of the East, they carefully repeated the sacred rites of baptism(8) and ordination; as they rejected the validity of those which he had already received from the hands of heretics or schismatics.
 Bishops, virgins, and even spotless infants, were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the Donatists.
 If they obtained possession of a church which had been used by their <NORP>Catholic</NORP> adversaries, they purified the unhallowed building with the same jealous care which a temple of idols might have required.
 They washed the pavement, scraped the walls, burnt the altar (which was commonly of wood), melted the consecrated plate, and cast the Holy Eucharist to the dogs, with every circumstance of ignominy which could provoke and perpetuate the animosity of religious factions.
(9) Notwithstanding this irreconcilable aversion, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> parties, who were mixed and separated in all the cities of Africa, had the same language and manners, the same zeal and learning, the same faith and worship.
 Proscribed by the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the empire, the <NORP>Donatists</NORP> still maintained in some provinces, particularly in Numidia, their superior numbers; and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate.
 But the invincible spirit of the sect sometimes preyed on its own vitals: and the bosom of their schismatical church was torn by intestine divisions.
 A <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> part of the <NORP>Donatist</NORP> bishops followed the independent standard of the Maximianists.
 The narrow and solitary path which their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> leaders had marked out continued to deviate from the great society of mankind Even the imperceptible sect of the <NORP>Rogatians</NORP> could affirm, without a blush, that when <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> should descend to judge the earth, he would find his true religion preserved only in a few nameless villages of the Caesarean Mauritania.
(10) The <NORP>Trinitarian</NORP> controversy.
 The schism of the <NORP>Donatists</NORP> was confined to Africa; the more diffusive mischief of the <NORP>Trinitarian</NORP> controversy successively penetrated into every part of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world.
 The former was an accidental quarrel, occasioned by the abuse of freedom; the latter was a high and mysterious argument, derived from the abuse of philosophy.
 From the age of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to that of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> and Theodoric, the temporal interests both of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians were deeply involved in the theological disputes of Arianism.
 The historian may therefore be permitted respectfully to withdraw the veil of the sanctuary, and to deduce the progress of reason and faith, of error and passion, from the school of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> to the decline and fall of the empire.
 The system of Plato.
 Before <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> 360.
 The genius of Plato, informed by his own meditation or by the traditional knowledge of :he priests of Egypt,(11) had ventured to explore the mysterious nature of the Deity.
 When he had elevated his mind to the sublime contemplation of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> self-existent, necessary cause of the universe, the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> sage was incapable of conceiving how the simple unity of his essence could admit the infinite variety of distinct and successive ideas which compose the model of the intellectual world; how a Being purely incorporeal could execute that perfect model, and mould with a plastic hand the rude and independent chaos.
 The vain hope of extricating himself from these difficulties, which must ever oppress the feeble powers of the human mind, might induce <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> to consider the divine nature under the threefold modification — of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> cause, the reason, or The <ORG>Logos</ORG> Logos, and the soul or spirit of the universe.
 His poetical imagination sometimes fixed and animated these metaphysical abstractions; the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> archical or original principles were represented in the <NORP>Platonic</NORP> system as <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> Gods, united with each other by a mysterious and ineffable generation; and the <ORG>Logos</ORG> was particularly considered under the more accessible character of the <PERSON>Son</PERSON> of an Eternal Father, and the Creator and Governor of he world.
 Such appear to have been the secret doctrines which were cautiously whispered in the gardens of the Academy; and which, according to the more recent disciples of Plato, could not be perfectly understood till after an assiduous study of thirty years.
(12) taught in the scool of Alexandria.
 Before <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> 300.
 The arms of the <NORP>Macedonians</NORP> diffused over <LOC>Asia</LOC> and <GPE>Egypt</GPE> the language and learning of Greece; and the theological system of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> was taught, with less reserve, and perhaps with some improvements, in the celebrated school of Alexandria.
 (13) A numerous colony of <NORP>Jews</NORP> had been invited, by the favour of the Ptolemies, to settle in their new capital.
(14) While the bulk of the nation practised the legal ceremonies, and pursued the lucrative occupations of commerce, a few <NORP>Hebrews</NORP> of a more liberal spirit devoted their lives to religious and philosophical contemplation.
 (15) They cultivated with diligence, and embraced with ardour, the theological system of the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> sage.
 But their national pride would have been mortified by a fair confession of their former poverty: and they boldly marked, as the sacred inheritance of their ancestors, the gold and jewels which they had so lately stolen from their <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> masters.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years before the birth of Christ, a philosophical treatise, which manifestly betrays the style and sentiments of the school of Plato, was produced by the <NORP>Alexandrian</NORP> Jews, and unanimously received as a genuine and valuable relic of the inspired Wisdom of Solomon.
 (16) A similar union of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> faith and the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> philosophy distinguishes the works of Philo, which were composed, for the most part, under the reign of Augustus.
(17) The material soul of the universe(18) might offend the piety of the Hebrews; but they applied the character of the <ORG>Logos</ORG> to the Jehovah of Moses and the Patriarchs; and the <PERSON>Son</PERSON> of God was introduced upon earth, under a visible and even human appearance, to perform those familiar offices which seem incompatible with the nature and attributes of the Universal Cause.
(19) Revealed by the <PERSON>Apostle</PERSON> St John, A.
D.
 97.
 The eloquence of Plato, the name of Solomon, the authority of the school of Alexandria, and the consent of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and Greeks, were insufficient to establish the truth of a mysterious doctrine, which might please, but could not satisfy, a rational mind.
 A prophet, or apostle, inspired by the Deity, can alone exercise a lawful dominion over the faith of mankind: and the theology of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> might have been for ever confounded with the philosophical visions of the Academy, the Porch, and the Lyccum, if the name and divine attributes of the <ORG>Logos</ORG> had not been confirmed by the celestial pen of the last and most sublime of the Evangelists.
 (20) The <NORP>Christian</NORP> Revelation, which was consummated under the reign of Nerva, disclosed to the world the amazing secret, that the LOGOS, who was with God from the beginning, and was God, who had made all things, and for whom all things had been made, was incarnate in the person of <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> of Nazareth; who had been born of a virgin, and suffered death on the cross.
 Besides the general design of fixing on a perpetual basis the divine honours of Christ, the most ancient and respectable of the ecclesiastical writers have ascribed to the evangelic theologian a particular intention to confute <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> opposite heresies, which disturbed the peace of the primitive church.
(21) The <PERSON>Ebionites</PERSON> and <PERSON>Docetes</PERSON> I.
 The faith of the Ebionites, (22) perhaps of the Nazarenes,(23) was gross and imperfect.
 They revered <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> as the greatest of the prophets, endowed with supernatural virtue and power.
 They ascribed to his person and to his future reign all the predictions of the <NORP>Hewbrew</NORP> oracles which relate to the spiritual and everlasting kingdom of the promised Messiah.
 (24) Some of them might confess that he was born of a virgin; but they obstinately rejected the preceding existence and divine perfections of the logos, or <PERSON>Son</PERSON> of God, which are so clearly defined in the <WORK_OF_ART>Gospel</WORK_OF_ART> of St.
 John.
 About <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years afterwards, the Ebionites, whose errors are mentioned by Justin Martyr, with less severity than they seem to deserve, (25) formed a very inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> name.
 II.
 The Gnostics, who were distinguished by the epithet of Docetes, deviated into the contrary extreme, and betrayed the human, while they asserted the divine nature of Christ.
 Educated in the school of Plato, accustomed to the sublime idea of the Logos, they readily conceived that the brightest Aeon, or Emanation of the Deity, might assume the outward shape and visible appearances of a mortal;(26) but they vainly pretended that the imperfections of matter are incompatible with the purity of a celestial substance.
 While the blood of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> yet smoked on Mount Calvary, the <PERSON>Docetes</PERSON> invented the impious and extravagant hypothesis, that, instead of issuing from the womb of the Virgin,(27) he had descended on the banks of the <GPE>Jordan</GPE> in the form of perfect manhood; that he had imposed on the senses of his enemies and of his disciples; and that the ministers of <PERSON>Pilate</PERSON> had wasted their impotent rage on an airy phantom, who seemed to expire on the cross, and, after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days, to rise from the dead.
(28) Mysterious nature of the Trinity.
 The divine sanction which the <PERSON>Apostle</PERSON> had bestowed on the fundamental principle of the theology of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> encouraged the learned proselytes of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> centuries to admire and study the writings of the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> sage, who had thus marvellously anticipated <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most surprising discoveries of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> revelation.
 The respectable name of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> was used by the orthodox,(29) and abused by the heretics,(30) as the common support of truth and error: the authority of his skilful commentators and the science of dialectics were employed to justify the remote consequences of his opinions, and to supply the discreet silence of the inspired writers.
 The same subtle and profound questions concerning the nature, the generation, the distinction, and the equality of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> divine persons of the mysterious Triad, or Trinity,(31) were agitated in the philosophical and in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> schools of Alexandria.
 An eager spirit of curiosity urged them to explore the secrets of the abyss; and the pride of the professors and of their disciples was satisfied with the science of words.
 But the most sagacious of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> theologians, the great <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> himself, has candidly confessed (32) that, whenever he forced his understanding to meditate on the divinity of the Logos, his toilsome and unavailing efforts recoiled on themselves; that the more he thought, the less he comprehended; and the more he wrote, the less capable was he of expressing his thoughts.
 In every step of the inquiry we are compelled to feel and acknowledge the immeasurable disproportion between the size of the object and the capacity of the human mind.
 We may strive to abstract the notions of time, of space, and of matter, which so closely adhere to all the perceptions of our experimental knowledge.
 But as soon as we presume to reason of infinite substance, of spiritual generation, as often as we deduce any positive conclusions from a negative idea, we are involved in darkness, perplexity, and inevitable contradiction.
 As these difficulties arise from the nature of the subject, they oppress, with the same insuperable weight, the philosophic and the theological disputant; but we may observe <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> essential and peculiar circumstances which discriminated the doctrines of the catholic church from the opinions of the <NORP>Platonic</NORP> school.
 Zeal of the Christians.
 I.
 A chosen society of philosophers, men of a liberal education and curious disposition, might silently meditate, and temperately discuss in the gardens of <GPE>Athens</GPE> or the library of Alexandria, the abstruse questions of metaphysical science.
 The lofty speculations, which neither convinced the understanding nor agitated the passions of the <NORP>Platonists</NORP> themselves, were carelessly overlooked by the idle, the busy, and even the studious part of mankind.
(33) But after the logos had been revealed as the sacred object of the faith, the hope, and the religious worship of the Christians, the mysterious system was embraced by a numerous and increasing multitude in every province of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 Those persons who, from their age, or sex, or occupations, were the least qualified to judge, who were the least exercised in the habits of abstract reasoning, aspired to contemplate the economy of the Divine Nature: and it is the boast of <PERSON>Tertullian</PERSON> (34) that a <NORP>Christian</NORP> mechanic could readily answer such questions as had perplexed the wisest of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> sages.
 Where the subject lies so far beyond our reach, the difference between the highest and the lowest of human understandings may indeed be calculated as infinitely small; yet the degree of weakness may perhaps be measured by the degree of obstinacy and dogmatic confidence.
 These speculations, instead of being treated as the amusement of a vacant hour, became the most serious business of the present, and the most useful preparation for a future life.
 A theology which it was incumbent to believe, which it was impious to doubt, and which it might be dangerous, and even fatal, to mistake, became the familiar topic of private meditation and popular discourse.
 The cold indifference of philosophy was inflamed by the fervent spirit of devotion; and even the metaphors of common language suggested the fallacious prejudices of sense and experience.
 The Christians, who abhorred the gross and impure generation of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> mythology, (35) were tempted to argue from the familiar analogy of the filial and paternal relations.
 The character of <PERSON>Son</PERSON> seemed to imply a perpetual subordination to the voluntary author of his existence;(36) but as the act of generation, in the most spiritual and abstracted sense, must be supposed to transmit the properties of a common nature,(37) they durst not presume to circumscribe the powers or the duration of the <PERSON>Son</PERSON> of an eternal and omnipotent Father.
 Four-score years after the death of Christ, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of <GPE>Bithynia</GPE> declared before the tribunal of <PERSON>Pliny</PERSON> that they invoked him as a god: and his divine honours have been perpetuated in every age and country, by the various sects who assume the name of his disciples.
(38) Their tender reverence for the memory of Christ, and their horror for the profane worship of any created being, would have engaged them to assert the equal and absolute divinity of the logos, if their rapid ascent towards the throne of heaven had not been imperceptibly checked by the apprehension of violating the unity and sole supremacy of the great Father of Christ, and of the Universe.
 The suspense and fluctuation produced in the minds of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> by these opposite tendencies may be observed in the writings of the theologians who flourished after the end of the apostolic age and before the origin of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> controversy.
 Their suffrage is claimed, with equal confidence, by the orthodox and by the heretical parties and the most inquisitive critics have fairly allowed that, if they had the good fortune of possessing the catholic verity, they have delivered their conceptions in loose, inaccurate, and sometimes contradictory language.
(39) Authority of the church.
.
 II.
 The devotion of individuals was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> circumstance which distinguished the <NORP>Christians</NORP> from the Platonists: the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> was the authority of the church.
 The disciples of philosophy asserted the rights of intellectual freedom, and their respect for the sentiments of their teachers was a liberal and voluntary tribute which they offered to superior reason.
 But the <NORP>Christians</NORP> formed a numerous and disciplined society; and the jurisdiction of their laws and magistrates was strictly exercised over the minds of the faithful.
 The loose wanderings of the imagination were gradually confined by creeds and confessions; (40) the freedom of private judgment submitted to the public wisdom of synods; the authority of a theologian was determined by his ecclesiastical rank; and the episcopal successors of the apostles inflicted the censures of the church on those who deviated from the orthodox belief.
 But in an age of religious controversy every act of oppression adds new force to the elastic vigour of the mind; and the zeal or obstinacy of a spiritual rebel was sometimes stimulated by secret motives of ambition or avarice.
 Factions A metaphysical argument became the cause or pretence of political contests; the subtleties of the <NORP>Platonic</NORP> school were used as the badges of popular factions, and the distance which separated their respective tenets was enlarged or magnified by the acrimony of dispute.
 As long as the dark heresies of <PERSON>Praxeas</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sabellius</PERSON> laboured to confound the Father with the Son, (41) the orthodox party might be excused if they adhered more strictly and more earnestly to the distinction than to the equality of the divine persons.
 But as soon as the heat of controversy had subsided and the progress of the <NORP>Sabellians</NORP> was no longer an object of terror to the churches of Rome, of Africa, or of Egypt, the tide of theological opinion began to flow with a gentle but steady motion toward the contrary extreme; and the most orthodox doctors allowed themselves the use of the terms and definitions which had been censured in the mouth of the sectaries.
(42) After the edict of toleration had restored peace and leisure to the Christians, the <NORP>Trinitarian</NORP> controversy was revived in the ancient seat of Platonism, the learned, the opulent, the tumultuous city of Alexandria; and the flame of religious discord was rapidly communicated from the schools to the clergy, the people, the provinces, and the East.
 The abstruse question of the eternity of the logos was agitated in ecclesiastic conferences and popular sermons; and the <PERSON>Arius</PERSON> heterodox opinions of <PERSON>Arius</PERSON> (43) were soon made public by his own zeal and by that of his adversaries.
 His most implacable adversaries have acknowledged the learning and blameless life of the eminent presbyter, who, in a former election, had declined, and perhaps generously declined, his pretensions to the episcopal throne.
 (44) His competitor <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> assumed the office of his judge.
 The important cause was argued before him; and if at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> he seemed to hesitate, he at length pronounced his final sentence as an absolute rule of faith.
 (45) The undaunted presbyter, who presumed to resist the authority of his angry bishop, was separated from the communion of the church.
 But the pride of <PERSON>Arius</PERSON> was supported by the applause of a numerous party.
 He reckoned among his immediate followers <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bishops of Egypt, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> presbyters, <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> deacons, and (what may appear almost incredible) <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> virgins.
 A large majority of the bishops of <LOC>Asia</LOC> appeared to support or favour his cause; and their measures were conducted by <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> of Caesarea, the most learned of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> prelates; and by <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> of Nicomedia, who had acquired the reputation of a statesman without forfeiting that of a saint.
 Synods in <GPE>Palestine</GPE> and <GPE>Bithynia</GPE> were opposed to the synods of Egypt.
 The attention of the prince and people was attracted by this theological dispute; and the decision, at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years,(46) was referred to the supreme authority of the general council of Nice.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> systems of the Trinity.
 When the mysteries of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith were dangerously exposed to public debate, it might be observed that the human understanding was capable of forming <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> distinct, though imperfect, systems concerning the nature of the Divine Trinity, and it was pronounced that none of these systems, in a pure and absolute sense, were exempt from heresy and error.
 (47) Arianism.
 I.
 According to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> hypothesis, which was maintained by <PERSON>Arius</PERSON> and his disciples, the logos was a dependent and spontaneous production, created from nothing by the will of the Father.
 The Son, by whom all things were made, (48) had been begotten before all worlds, and the longest of the astronomical periods could be compared only as a fleeting moment to the extent of his duration; yet this duration was not infinite,(49) and there had been a time which preceded the ineffable generation of the logos.
 On this only begotten <PERSON>Son</PERSON> the Almighty Father had transfused his ample spirit, and impressed the effulgence of his glory.
 Visible image of invisible perfection, he saw, at an immeasurable distance beneath his feet, the thrones of the brightest archangels; yet he shone only with a reflected light, and, like the sons of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors, who were invested with the titles of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> or Augustus, (50) he governed the universe in obedience to the will of his Father and Monarch.
 Tritheism.
 II.
 In the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> hypothesis, the logos possessed all the inherent, incommunicable perfections which religion and philosophy appropriate to the Supreme God.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> distinct and infinite minds or substances, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> co-equal and co-eternal beings, composed the Divine Essence; (51) and it would have implied contradiction that any of them should not have existed, or that they should ever cease to exist.
 (52) The advocates of a system which seemed to establish <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent <ORG>Deities</ORG> attempted to preserve the unity of the First Cause, so conspicuous in the design and order of the world, by the perpetual concord of their administration and the essential agreement of their will.
 A faint resemblance of this unity of action may be discovered in the societies of men, and even of animals.
 The causes which disturb their harmony proceed only from the imperfection and inequality of their faculties; but the omnipotence which is guided by infinite wisdom and goodness cannot fail of choosing the same means for the accomplishment of the same ends.
 Sabellianism.
 III.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> beings, who, by the self-derived necessity of their existence, possess all the divine attributes in the most perfect degree, who are eternal in duration, infinite in space, and intimately present to each other and to the whole universe, irresistibly force themselves on the astonished mind as <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> and the same Being,(53) who, in the economy of grace, as well as in that of nature, may manifest himself under different forms, and be considered under different aspects.
 By this hypothesis a real substantial trinity is refined into a trinity of names and abstract modifications that subsist only in the mind which conceives them.
 The logos is no longer a person, but an attribute; and it is only in a figurative sense that the epithet of <PERSON>Son</PERSON> can be applied to the eternal reason which was with God from the beginning, and by which, not by whom, all things were made.
 The incarnation of the logos is reduced to a mere inspiration of the Divine Wisdom, which filled the soul and directed all the actions of the man Jesus.
 Thus, after revolving round the theological circle, we are surprised to find that the <NORP>Sabellian</NORP> ends where the <NORP>Ebionite</NORP> had begun, and that the incomprehensible mystery which excites our adoration eludes our inquiry(54) Council of Nice, A.
D.
 325.
 If the bishops of the council of Nice(55) had been permitted to follow the unbiassed dictates of their conscience, <PERSON>Arius</PERSON> and his associates could scarcely have flattered themselves with the hopes of obtaining a majority of votes in favour of an hypothesis so directly adverse to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most popular opinions of the catholic world.
 The <NORP>Arians</NORP> soon perceived the danger of their situation, and prudently assumed those modest virtues which, in the fury of civil and religious dissensions, are seldom practised, or even praised, except by the weaker party.
 They recommended the exercise of <NORP>Christian</NORP> charity and moderation, urged the incomprehensible nature of the controversy, disclaimed the use of any terms or definitions which could not be found in the Scriptures, and offered, by very liberal concessions, to satisfy their adversaries without renouncing the integrity of their own principles.
 The victorious faction received all their proposals with haughty suspicion, and anxiously sought for some irreconcilable mark of distinction, the rejection of which might involve the <NORP>Arians</NORP> in the guilt and consequences of heresy.
 A letter was publicly read and ignominiously torn, in which their patron, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> of Nicomedia, ingenuously confessed that the admission of the HOMOOUSION, or Consubstantial, a word already familiar to the Platonists, was incompatible with the principles of their theological system.
 The fortunate opportunity was eagerly embraced by the bishops, who governed the resolutions of the synod, and, according to the lively expressions of Ambrose, (56) they used the sword, which heresy itself had drawn from the scabbard, to cut off the head of the hated monster.
 The consubstantiality of the Father and the <PERSON>Son</PERSON> was established by the council of Nice, and has been unanimously received as a fundamental article of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith by the consent of the Greek, the Latin, the Oriental, and the <NORP>Protestant</NORP> churches.
 But if the same word had not served to stigmatise the heretics and to unite the catholics, it would have been inadequate to the purpose of the majority by whom it was introduced into the orthodox creed.
 This majority was divided into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> parties, distinguished by a contrary tendency to the sentiments of the <NORP>Tritheists</NORP> and of the Sabellians.
 But as those opposite extremes seemed to overthrow the foundations either of natural or revealed religion, they mutually agreed to qualify the rigour of their principles, and to disavow the just, but invidious, consequences which might be urged by their antagonists.
 The interest of the common cause inclined them to join their numbers and to conceal their differences; their animosity was softened by the healing counsels of toleration, and their disputes were suspended by the use of the mysterious Homoousion, which either party was free to interpret according to their peculiar tenets.
 The <NORP>Sabellian</NORP> sense, which, about <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years before, had obliged the council of Antioch(57) to prohibit this celebrated term, had endeared it to those theologians who entertained a secret but partial affection for a nominal Trinity.
 But the more fashionable saints of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> times, the intrepid Athanasius, the learned <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> Nazianzen, and the other pillars of the church, who supported with ability and success the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> doctrine, appeared to consider the expression of substance as if it had been synonymous with that of nature; and they ventured to illustrate their meaning by affirming that <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> men, as they belong to the same common species, are consubstantial or homoousian to each other.
(58) This pure and distinct equality was tempered, on the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hand, by the internal connection and spiritual penetration which indissolubly unites the divine persons; (59) and, on the other, by the pre-eminence of the Father, which was acknowledged as far as it is compatible with the independence of the Son.
 (60) Within these limits the almost invisible and tremulous ball of orthodoxy was allowed securely to vibrate.
 On either side, beyond this consecrated ground, the heretics and the daemons lurked in ambush to surprise and devour the unhappy wanderer.
 But as the degrees of theological hatred depend on the spirit of the war rather than on the importance of the controversy, the heretics who degraded were treated with more severity than those who annihilated the person of the Son.
 The life of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> was consumed in irreconcilable opposition to the impious madness of the Arians,(61) but he defended above twenty years the Sabellianism of Marcellus of Ancyra; and when at last he was compelled to withdraw himself from his communion, he continued to mention with an ambiguous smile the venial errors of his respectable friend.
(62) <NORP>Arian</NORP> Creeds.
 The authority of a general council, to which the <NORP>Arians</NORP> themselves had been compelled to submit, inscribed on the banners of the orthodox party the mysterious characters of the word Homoousion, which essentially contributed, notwithstanding some obscure disputes, some nocturnal combats, to maintain and perpetuate the uniformity of faith, or at least of language.
 The Consubstantialists, who by their success have deserved and obtained the title of Catholics, gloried in the simplicity and steadiness of their own creed, and insulted the repeated variations of their adversaries, who were destitute of any certain rule of faith.
 The sincerity or the cunning of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> chiefs, the fear of the laws or of the people, their reverence for Christ, their hatred of Athanasius, all the causes, human and divine, that influence and disturb the counsels of a theological faction, introduced among the sectaries a spirit of discord and inconstancy which in the course of a few years erected <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> different models of religion,(63) and avenged the violated dignity of the church.
 The zealous Hilary, (64) who, from the peculiar hardships of his situation, was inclined to extenuate rather than to aggravate the errors of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> clergy, declares that, in the wide extent of the <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> to which he had been banished, there could be found very few prelates who had preserved the knowledge of the true God.
(65) The oppression which he had felt, the disorders of which he was the spectator and the victim, appeased, during a short interval, the angry passions of his soul and in the following passage, of which I shall transcribe a few lines, the bishop of <GPE>Poitiers</GPE> unwarily deviates into the style of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> philosopher.
 <NORP>Arian</NORP> Sects It will not be expected, it would not perhaps be endured, that I should swell this theological digression by.
 a minute examination of the <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> creeds, the authors of which, for the most part, disclaimed the odious name of their parent Arius.
 It is amusing enough to delineate the form, and to trace the vegetation, of a singular plant; but the tedious detail of leaves without flowers, and of branches without fruit, would soon exhaust the patience and disappoint the curiosity of the laborious student.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> question, which gradually arose from the <NORP>Arian</NORP> controversy, may, however, be noticed, as it served to produce and discriminate the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sects who were united only by their common aversion to the <EVENT>Homoousion</EVENT> of the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> synod.
 1/.
 If they were asked whether the <PERSON>Son</PERSON> was like unto the Father, the question was resolutely answered in the negative by the heretics who adhered to the principles of Arius, or indeed to those of philosophy, which seem to establish an infinite difference between the Creator and the most excellent of his creatures.
 This obvious consequence was maintained by Aetius,(67) on whom the zeal of his adversaries bestowed the surname of the Atheist.
 His restless and aspiring spirit urged him to try almost every profession of human life.
 He was successively a slave, or at least a husbandman, a travelling tinker, a goldsmith, a physician, a schoolmaster, a theologian, and at last the apostle of a new church, which was propagated by the abilities of his disciple Eunomius.
(68) Armed with texts of Scripture, and with captious syllogisms from the logic of Aristotle, the subtle <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> had acquired the fame of an invincible disputant, whom it was impossible either to silence or to convince.
 Such talents engaged the friendship of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishops, till they were forced to renounce and even to persecute a dangerous ally, who, by the accuracy of his reasoning, had prejudiced their cause in the popular opinion, and offended the piety of their most devoted followers.
 2/.
 The omnipotence of the Creator suggested a specious and respectful solution of the likeness of the Father and the Son; and faith might humbly receive what reason could not presume to deny, that the Supreme God might communicate his infinite perfections, and create a being similar only to himself.
 (69) These <NORP>Arians</NORP> were powerfully supported by the weight and abilities of their leaders, who had succeeded to the management of the <NORP>Eusebian</NORP> interest, and who occupied the principal thrones of the East.
 They detested, perhaps with some affectation, the impiety of Aetius; they professed to believe, either without reserve or according to the Scriptures, that the <PERSON>Son</PERSON> was different from all other creatures, and similar only to the Father.
 But they denied that he was either of the same or of a similar substance; sometimes boldly justifying their dissent, and sometimes objecting to the use of the word substance, which seems to imply an adequate, or at least a distinct, notion of the nature of the Diety.
 3/.
 The sect which asserted the doctrine of a similar substance was the most numerous, at least in the provinces of Asia; and when the leaders of both parties were assembled in the council of Seleucia, (70) their opinion would have prevailed by a majority of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> to <CARDINAL>forty-three</CARDINAL> bishops.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> word which was chosen to express this mysterious resemblance bears so close an affinity to the orthodox symbol, that the profane of every age have derided the furious contests which the difference of a single diphthong excited between the <NORP>Homoousians</NORP> and the Homoiousians.
 As it frequently happens that the sounds and characters which approach the nearest to each other accidentally represent the most opposite ideas, the observation would be itself ridiculous, if it were possible to mark any real and sensible distinction between the doctrine of the Semi-Arians, as they were improperly styled, and that of the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> themselves.
 The bishop of Poitiers, who in his <GPE>Phrygian</GPE> exile very wisely aimed at a coalition of parties, endeavours to prove that, by a pious and faithful interpretation,(71) the <ORG>Homoiousion</ORG> may be reduced to a consubstantial sense.
 Yet he confesses that the word has a dark and suspicious aspect; and, as if darkness were congenial to theological disputes, the Semi-Arians, who advanced to the doors of the church, assailed them with the most unrelenting fury.
 Faith of the <NORP>Western</NORP> or <NORP>Latin</NORP> church The provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, which cultivated the language and manners of the Greeks, had deeply imbibed the venom of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> controversy.
 The familiar study of the <NORP>Platonic</NORP> system, a vain and argumentative disposition, a copious and flexible idiom, supplied the clergy and people of the <LOC>East</LOC> with an inexhaustible flow of words and distinctions; and, in the midst of their fierce contentions, they easily forgot the doubt which is recommended by philosophy, and the submission which is enjoined by religion.
 The inhabitants of the <LOC>West</LOC> were of a less inquisitive spirit, their passions were not so forcibly moved by invisible objects, their minds were less frequently exercised by the habits of dispute; and such was the happy ignorance of the <NORP>Gallican</NORP> church, that <PERSON>Hilary</PERSON> himself, above thirty years after the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> general council, was still a stranger to the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> creed.
(72) The <NORP>Latins</NORP> had received the rays of divine knowledge through the dark and doubtful medium of a translation.
 The poverty and stubbornness of their native tongue was not always capable of affording just equivalents for the <NORP>Greek</NORP> terms, for the technical words of the <NORP>Platonic</NORP> philosophy, (73) which had been consecrated, by the <WORK_OF_ART>Gospel</WORK_OF_ART> or by the church, to express the mysteries of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith, and a verbal defect might introduce into the <NORP>Latin</NORP> theology a long train of error or perplexity.
(74) But as the western provincials had the good fortune of deriving their religion from an orthodox source, they preserved with steadiness the doctrine which they had accepted with docility; and when the <NORP>Arian</NORP> pestilence approached their frontiers, they were supplied with the seasonable preservative of the <EVENT>Homoousion</EVENT> by the paternal care of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 Council of Rimi, A.
D.
 360 Their sentiments and their temper were displayed in the memorable synod of Rimini, which surpassed in numbers the council of Nice, since it was composed of above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> bishops of Italy, Africa, Spain, Gaul, Britain, and Illyricum.
 From the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> debates it appeared that only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> score prelates adhered to the party, though they affected to anathematise the name and memory of Arius.
 But this inferiority was compensated by the advantages of skill, of experience, and of discipline; and the minority was conducted by <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> and Ursacius, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bishops of Illyricum, who had spent their lives in the intrigues of courts and councils, and who had been trained under the <NORP>Eusebian</NORP> banner in the religious wars of the East.
 By their arguments and negotiations they embarrassed, they confounded, they at last deceived the honest simplicity of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> bishops, who suffered the palladium of the faith to be extorted from their hands by fraud and importunity, rather than by open violence.
 The council of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was not allowed to separate till the members had imprudently subscribed a captious creed, in which some expressions, susceptible of an heretical sense, were inserted in the room of the Homoousion.
 It was on this occasion that, according to Jerom, the world was surprised to find itself Arian.
(75) But the bishops of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> provinces had no sooner reached their respective dioceses than they discovered their mistake, and repented of their weakness.
 The ignominious capitulation was rejected with disdain and abhorrence, and the <NORP>Homoousian</NORP> standard, which had been shaken but not overthrown, was more firmly replanted in all the churches of the West.
(76) Conduct of the emperors in the <NORP>Arian</NORP> controvesy Such was the rise and progress, and such were the natural revolutions, of those theological disputes which disturbed the peace of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> under the reigns of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and of his sons.
 But as those princes presumed to extend their despotism over the faith, as well as over the lives and fortunes of their subjects, the weight of their suffrage sometimes inclined the ecclesiastical balance: and the prerogatives of the King of Heaven were settled, or changed, or modified, in the cabinet of an earthly monarch.
 Indifference of Constantine, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>324</CARDINAL> The unhappy spirit of discord which pervaded the provinces of the <LOC>East</LOC> interrupted the triumph of Constantine; but the emperor continued for some time to view with cool and careless indifference the object of the dispute.
 As he was yet ignorant of the difficulty of appeasing the quarrels of theologians, he addressed to the contending parties, to <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> and to Arius, a moderating epistle;(77) which may be ascribed with far greater reason to the untutored sense of a soldier and statesman than to the dictates of any of his episcopal counsellors.
 He attributes the origin of the whole controversy to a trifling and subtle question concerning an incomprehensible point of the law, which was foolishly asked by the bishop, and imprudently resolved by the presbyter.
 He laments that the <NORP>Christian</NORP> people, who had the same God, the same religion, and the same worship, should be divided by such inconsiderable distinctions; and he seriously recommends to the clergy of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> the example of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> philosophers, who could maintain their arguments without losing their temper and assert their freedom without violating their friendship.
 The indifference and contempt of the sovereign would have been, perhaps, the most effectual method of silencing the dispute, if the popular current had been less rapid and impetuous, and if <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> himself, in the midst of faction and fanaticism, could have preserved the calm possession of his own mind.
 But his ecclesiastical ministers soon contrived to seduce the impartiality of the magistrate, and to awaken the zeal of the proselyte.
 His zeal.
 A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>325</CARDINAL> He was provoked by the insults which had been offered to his statues; he was alarmed by the real as well as the imaginary magnitude of the spreading mischief; and he extinguished the hope of peace and toleration, from the moment that he assembled <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> bishops within the walls of the same palace.
 The presence of the monarch swelled the importance of the debate; his attention multiplied the arguments; and he exposed his person with a patient intrepidity which animated the valour of the combatants.
 Notwithstanding the applause which has been bestowed on the eloquence and sagacity of Constantine,(78) a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, whose religion might be still a subject of doubt, and whose mind had not been enlightened either by study or by inspiration, was indifferently qualified to discuss, in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language, a metaphysical question, or an article of faith.
 But the credit of his favourite Osius, who appears to have presided in the council of Nice, might dispose the emperor in favour of the orthodox party; and a well-timed insinuation, that the same <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> of Nicomedia, who now protected the heretic, had lately assisted the tyrant,(79) might exasperate him against their adversaries.
 The <NORP>Nicene</NORP> creed was ratified by Constantine; and his firm declaration, that those who resisted the divine judgment of the synod must prepare themselves for an immediate exile, annihilated the murmurs of a feeble opposition; which, from seventeen, was almost instantly reduced to two, protesting bishops.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> of <PERSON>Casarea</PERSON> yielded a reluctant and ambiguous consent to the homoousion; (80) and the wavering conduct of the Nicomedian <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> served only to delay about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months his disgrace and exile.
(81)He persecutes the <NORP>Arian</NORP> The impious <PERSON>Arius</PERSON> was banished into <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the remote provinces of Illyricum; his person and disciples were branded, by law, with the odious name of Porphyrians; his writings were condemned to the flames, and a capital punishment was denounced against those in whose possession they should be found.
 The emperor had now imbibed the spirit of controversy, and the angry sarcastic style of his edicts was designed to inspire his subjects with the hatred which he had conceived against the enemies of Christ.
(82) and the orthodox party, A.
D.
 328-337 But, as if the conduct of the emperor had been guided by passion instead of principle, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years from the council of <GPE>Nice</GPE> were scarcely elapsed before he discovered some symptoms of mercy, and even of indulgence, towards the proscribed sect, which was secretly protected by his favourite sister.
 The exiles were recalled; and Eusebius, who gradually resumed his influence over the mind of Constantine, was restored to the episcopal throne, from which he had been ignominiously degraded.
 <PERSON>Arius</PERSON> himself was treated by the whole court with the respect which would have been due to an innocent and oppressed man.
 His faith was approved by the synod of Jerusalem; and the emperor seemed impatient to repair his injustice, by issuing an absolute command that he should be solemnly admitted to the communion in the cathedral of Constantinople.
 On the same day which had been fixed for the triumph of Arius, he expired; and the strange and horrid circumstances of his death might excite a suspicion that the orthodox saints had contributed more efficaciously than by their prayers to deliver the church from the most formidable of her enemies.
 (83) The <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> principal leaders of the catholics, <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> of Alexandria, <PRODUCT>Eustathius</PRODUCT> of Antioch, and <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> of Constantinople, were deposed on various accusations, by the sentence of numerous councils; and were afterwards banished into distant provinces by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperors, who, in the last moments of his life received the rites of baptism from the <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop of Nicomedia.
 The ecclesiastical government of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> cannot be justified from the reproach of levity and weakness.
 But the credulous monarch, unskilled in the stratagems of theological warfare, might be deceived by the modest and specious professions of the heretics, whose sentiments he never perfectly understood; and while he protected Arius, and persecuted Athanasius, he still considered the council of <GPE>Nice</GPE> as the bulwark of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith, and the peculiar glory of his own reign.
(84) <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> favours the Arians, A.
D.
 337-361.
 The sons of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> must have been admitted from their childhood into the rank of catechumens, but they imitated, in the delay of their baptism, the example of their father.
 Like him, they presumed to pronounce their judgment on mysteries into which they had never been regularly initiated:(85) and the fate of the <NORP>Trinitarian</NORP> controversy depended, in a great measure, on the sentiments of Constantius, who inherited the provinces of the East, and acquired the possession of the whole empire.
 The <NORP>Arian</NORP> presbyter or bishop, who had secreted for his use the testament of the deceased emperor, improved the fortunate occasion which had introduced him to the familiarity of a prince whose public counsels were always swayed by his domestic favourites.
 The eunuchs and slaves diffused the spiritual poison through the palace, and the dadangerous infection was communicated by the female attendants to the guards, and by the empress to her unsuspicious husband.
(86) The partiality which <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> always expressed towards the <NORP>Eusebian</NORP> faction was insensibly fortified by the dexterous management of their leaders; and his victory over the tyrant <PERSON>Magnentius</PERSON> increased his inclination, as well as ability, to employ the arms of power in the cause of Arianism.
 While the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies were engaged in the plains of Mursa, and the fate of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rivals depended on the chance of war, the son of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> passed the anxious moments in a church of the martyrs, under the walls of the city.
 His spiritual comforter, Valens, the <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop of the diocese, employed the most artful precautions to obtain such early intelligence as might secure either his favour or his escape.
 A secret chain of swift and trusty messengers informed him of the vicissitudes of the battle; and while the courtiers stood trembling round their affrighted master, <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> assured him that the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> legions gave way; and insinuated, with some presence of mind, that the glorious event had been revealed to him by an angel.
 The grateful emperor ascribed his success to the merits and intercession of the bishop of Mursa, whose faith had deserved the public and miraculous approbation of Heaven.
 (87) The Arians, who considered as their own the victory of Constantius, preferred his glory to that of his father.
(88) Cyril, bishop of Jerusalem, immediately composed the description of a celestial cross, encircled with a splendid rainbow, which, during the festival of Pentecost, about the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> hour of the day, had appeared over the Mount of Olives, to the edification of the devout pilgrims and the people of the holy city.
 (89) The size of the meteor was gradually magnified; and the <NORP>Arian</NORP> historian has ventured to affirm that it was conspicuous to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies in the plains of Pannonia; and that the tyrant, who is purposely represented as an idolater, fled before the auspicious sign of orthodox Christianity.
(90) <NORP>Arian</NORP> Councils The sentiments of a judicious stranger, who has impartially considered the progress of civil or ecclesiastical discord, are always entitled to our notice: and a short passage of Ammianus, who served in the armies, and studied the character, of Constantius, is perhaps of more value than many pages of theologic invectives.
 Our more intimate knowledge of the ecclesiastical transactions of the reign of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> would furnish an ample commentary on this remarkable passage; which justifies the rational apprehensions of Athanasius, that the restless activity of the clergy, who wandered round the empire in search of the true faith, would excite the contempt and laughter of the unbelieving world.
 (92) As soon as the emperor was relieved from the terrors of the civil war, he devoted the leisure of his winter quarters at Arles, Milan, Sirmium, and Constantinople, to the amusement or toils of controversy: the sword of the magistrate, and even of the tyrant, was unsheathed, to enforce the reasons of the theologian; and as he opposed the orthodox faith of Nice, it is readily confessed that his incapacity and ignorance were equal to his presumption.
(93) The eunuchs, the women, and the bishops, who governed the vain and feeble mind of the emperor, had inspired him with an insuperable dislike to the Homoousion; but his timid conscience was alarmed by the impiety of Aetius.
 The guilt of that atheist was aggravated by the suspicious favour of the unfortunate Gallus; and even the deaths of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers who had been massacred at <GPE>Antioch</GPE> were imputed to the suggestions of that dangerous sophist.
 The mind of Constantius, which could neither be moderated by reason nor fixed by faith, was blindly impelled to either side of the dark and empty abyss by his horror of the opposite extreme; he alternately embraced and condemned the sentiments, he successively banished and recalled the leaders, of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> and <NORP>Semi-Arian</NORP> factions.
 (94) During the season of public business or festivity, he employed whole days, and even nights, in selecting the words, and weighing the syllables, which composed his fluctuating creeds.
 The subject of his meditations still pursued and occupied his slumbers: the incoherent dreams of the emperor were received as celestial visions, and he accepted with complacency the lofty title of bishop of bishops, from those ecclesiastics who forgot the interest of their order for the gratification of their passions.
 The design of establishing an uniformity of doctrine, which had engaged him to convene so many synods in Gaul, Italy, Illyricum, and Asia, was repeatedly baffled by his own levity, by the divisions of the Arians, and by the resistance of the catholics; and he resolved, as the last and decisive effort, imperiously to dictate the decrees of a general council.
 The destructive earthquake of Nicomedia, the difficulty of finding a convenient place, and perhaps some secret motives of policy, produced an alteration in the summons.
 The bishops of the <LOC>East</LOC> were directed to meet at Seleucia, in Isauria; while those of the <LOC>West</LOC> held their deliberations at Rimini, on the coast of the Hadriatic, and instead of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deputies from each province, the whole episcopal body was ordered to march.
 The <NORP>Eastern</NORP> council, after consuming <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> days in fierce and unavailing debate, separated without any definite conclusion.
 The council of the <LOC>West</LOC> was protracted till the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> month.
 Taurus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, was instructed not to dismiss the prelates till they should all be united in the same opinion; and his efforts were supported by a power of banishing <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> of the most refractory, and a promise of the consulship if he achieved so difficult an adventure.
 His prayers and threats, the authority of the sovereign, the sophistry of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> and Ursacius, the distress of cold and hunger, and the tedious melancholy of a hopeless exile, at length extorted the reluctant consent of the bishops of Rimini.
 The deputies of the <LOC>East</LOC> and of the <LOC>West</LOC> attended the emperor in the palace of Constantinople, and he enjoyed the satisfaction of imposing on the world a profession of faith which established the likeness, without expressing the consubstantiality, of the <PERSON>Son</PERSON> of God.
(95) But the triumph of <ORG>Arianism</ORG> had been preceded by the removal of the orthodox clergy, whom it was impossible either to intimidate or to corrupt; and the reign of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was disgraced by the unjust and ineffectual persecution of the great Athanasius.
 Character and adventures of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> We have seldom an opportunity of observing, either in active or speculative life, what effect may be produced, or what obstacles may be surmounted, by the force of a single mind, when it is inflexibly applied to the pursuit of a single object.
 The immortal name of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> (96) will never be separated from the catholic doctrine of the Trinity, to whose defence he consecrated every moment and every faculty of his being.
 Educated in the family of Alexander, he had vigorously opposed the early progress of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy: he exercised the important functions of secretary under the aged prelate; and the fathers of the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> council beheld with surprise and respect the rising virtues of the young deacon.
 In a time of public danger the dull claims of age and of rank are sometimes superseded; and within <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months after his return from <GPE>Nice</GPE> the deacon <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> was seated on the archiepiscopal throne of Egypt.
 He filled that eminent station above forty-six years, and his long administration was spent in a perpetual combat against the powers of Arianism.
 <CARDINAL>Five</CARDINAL> times was <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> expelled from his throne; twenty years he passed as an exile or a fugitive; and almost every province of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was successively witness to his merit, and his sufferings in the cause of the Homoousion, which he considered as the sole pleasure and business, as the duty and as the glory of his life.
 Amidst the storms of persecution, the archbishop of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> was patient of labour, jealous of fame, careless of safety; and although his mind was tainted by the contagion of fanaticism, <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> displayed a superiority of character and abilities which would have qualified him, far better than the degenerate sons of Constantine, for the government of a great monarchy.
 His learning was much less profound and extensive than that of <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> of Caesarea, and his rude eloquence could not be compared with the polished oratory of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> or Basil; but whenever the primate of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> was called upon to justify his sentiments or his conduct, his unpremeditated style, either of speaking or writing, was clear, forcible, and persuasive.
 He has always been revered in the orthodox school as <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most accurate masters of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> theology; and he was supposed to possess <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> profane sciences, less adapted to the episcopal character — the knowledge of jurisprudence,(97) and that of divination.
 (98) Some fortunate conjectures of future events, which impartial reasoners might ascribe to the experience and judgment of Athanasius, were attributed by his friends to heavenly inspiration, and imputed by his enemies to infernal magic.
 But as <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> was continually engaged with the prejudices and passions of every order of men, from the monk to the emperor, the knowledge of human nature was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most important science.
 He preserved a distinct and unbroken view of a scene which was incessantly shifting; and never failed to improve those decisive moments which are irrecoverably past before they are perceived by a common eye.
 The archbishop of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> was capable of distinguishing how far he might boldly command, and where he must dexterously insinuate; how long he might contend with power, and when he must withdraw from persecution; and while he directed the thunders of the church against heresy and rebellion, he could assume, in the bosom of his own party, the flexible and indulgent temper of a prudent leader.
 The election of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> has not escaped the reproach of irregularity and precipitation; (99) but the propriety of his behaviour conciliated the affections both of the clergy and of the people.
 The <NORP>Alexandrians</NORP> were impatient to rise in arms for the defence of an eloquent and liberal pastor.
 In his distress he always derived support, or at least consolation, from the faithful attachment of his parochial clergy; and the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> bishops of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> adhered, with unshaken zeal, to the cause of Athanasius.
 In the modest equipage which pride and policy would affect, he frequently performed the episcopal visitation of his provinces, from the mouth of the <LOC>Nile</LOC> to the confines of Ethiopia; familiarly conversing with the meanest of the populace, and humbly saluting the saints and hermits of the desert.
(100) Nor was it only in ecclesiastical assemblies, among men whose education and manners were similar to his own, that <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> displayed the ascendancy of his genius.
 He appeared with easy and respectful firmness in the courts of princes; and in the various turns of his prosperous and adverse fortune he never lost the confidence of his friends, or the esteem of his enemies.
 Persecution against Athanasius, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>330</CARDINAL> In his youth the primate of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> resisted the great Constantine, who had repeatedly signified his will that <PERSON>Arius</PERSON> should be restored to the catholic communion.
(101) The emperor respected, and might forgive, this inflexible resolution; and the faction who considered <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> as their most formidable enemy were constrained to dissemble their hatred, and silently to prepare an indirect and distant assault.
 They scattered rumours and suspicions, represented the archbishop as a proud and oppressive tyrant, and boldly accused him of violating the treaty which had been ratified in the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> council with the schismatic followers of Meletius.
(102) <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> had openly disapproved that ignominious peace, and the emperor was disposed to believe that he had abused his ecclesiastical and civil power to persecute those odious sectaries; that he had sacrilegiously broken a chalice in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their churches of Maraeotis; that he had whipped or imprisoned <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> of their bishops; and that Arsenius, a <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> bishop of the same party, had been murdered, or at least mutilated, by the cruel hand of the primate.
(103) These charges, which affected his honour and his life, were referred by <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to his brother Dalmatius, the censor, who resided at Antioch; the synods of <GPE>Caesarea</GPE> and <GPE>Tyre</GPE> were successively convened; and the bishops of the <LOC>East</LOC> were instructed to judge the cause of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> before they proceeded to consecrate the new church of the Resurrection at Jerusalem.
 The primate might be conscious of his innocence; but he was sensible that the same implacable spirit which had dictated the accusation would direct the proceeding and pronounce the sentence.
 He prudently declined the tribunal of his enemies, despised the summons of the synod of Caesarea; and, after a long and artful delay, submitted to the peremptory commands of the emperor, who threatened to punish his criminal disobedience if he refused to appear in the council of Tyre.
(104) Before Athanasius, at the head of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> prelates, sailed from Alexandria, he had wisely secured the alliance of the Meletians; and <PERSON>Arsenius</PERSON> himself, his imaginary victim, and his secret friend, was privately concealed in his train.
 The synod of <GPE>Tyre</GPE> was conducted by <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> of Caesarea, with more passion, and with less art, than his learning and experience might promise; his numerous faction repeated the names of homicide and tyrant; and their clamours were encouraged by the seeming patience of Athanasius, who expected the decisive moment to produce <PERSON>Arsenius</PERSON> alive and unhurt in the midst of the assembly.
 The nature of the other charges did not admit of such clear and satisfactory replies; yet, the archbishop was able to prove that, in the village where he was accused of breaking a consecrated chalice, neither church nor altar nor chalice could really exist.
 The Arians, who had secretly determined the guilt and condemnation of their enemy, attempted, however, to disguise their injustice by the imitation of judicial forms; the synod appointed an episcopal commission of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> delegates to collect evidence on the spot; and this measure, which was vigorously opposed by the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> bishops, opened new scenes of violence and perjury.
(105) After the return of the deputies from Alexandria, the majority of the council pronounced the final sentence of degradation and exile against the primate of Egypt.
 The decree, expressed in the fiercest language of malice and revenge, was communicated to the emperor and the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church; and the bishops immediately resumed a mild and devout aspect, such as became their holy pilgrimage to the Sepulchre of Christ.
(106) His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exile, A.
D.
 336 But the injustice of these ecclesiastical judges had not been countenanced by the submission, or even by the presence, of Athanasius.
 He resolved to make a bold; and dangerous experiment, whether the throne was inaccessible to the voice of truth; and before the final sentence could be pronounced at Tyre, the intrepid primate threw himself into a bark which was ready to hoist sale for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The request of a formal audience might have been opposed or eluded; but <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> concealed his arrival, watched the moment of Constantine's return from an adjacent villa, and boldly encountered his angry sovereign as he passed on horseback through the principal street of Constantinople.
 So strange an apparition excited his surprise and indignation; and the guards were ordered to remove the importunate suitor; but his resentment was subdued by involuntary respect; and the haughty spirit of the emperor was awed by the courage and eloquence of a bishop who implored his justice and awakened his conscience.
 (107) <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> listened to the complaints of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> with impartial and even gracious attention; the members of the synod of <GPE>Tyre</GPE> were summoned to justify their proceedings and the arts of the <NORP>Eusebian</NORP> faction would have been confounded if they had not aggravated the guilt of the primate by the dexterous supposition of an unpardonable offence — a criminal design to intercept and detain the corn-fleet of Alexandria, which supplied the subsistence of the new capital.
(108) The emperor was satisfied that the peace of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> would be secured by the absence of a popular leader but he refused to fill the vacancy of the archiepiscopal throne; and the sentence which, after long hesitation, he pronounced, was that of a jealous ostracism rather than of an ignominious exile.
 In the remote province of Gaul, but in the hospitable court of Treves, <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> passed about twenty-eight months.
 and restoration, A.
D.
 338.
 The death of the emperor changed the face of public affairs; and, amidst the general indulgence of a young reign, the primate was restored to his country by an honourable edict of the younger Constantine, who expressed a deep sense of the innocence and merit of his venerable guest.
(109) His <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> exile, A.
D.
 341 The death of that prince exposed <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> to a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> persecution; and the feeble Constantius, the sovereign of the East, soon became the secret accomplice of the Eusebians.
 <CARDINAL>Ninety</CARDINAL> bishops of that sect or faction assembled at <GPE>Antioch</GPE> under the specious pretence of dedicating the cathedral.
 They composed an ambiguous creed, which is faintly tinged with the colours of Semi-Arianism, and <CARDINAL>twenty-five</CARDINAL> canons, which still regulate the discipline of the orthodox Greeks.
 (110) It was decided, with some appearance of equity, that a bishop, deprived by a synod, should not resume his episcopal functions till he had been absolved by the judgment of an equal synod; the law was immediately applied to the case of Athanasius; the council of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> pronounced, or rather confirmed, his degradation: a stranger, named Gregory, was seated on his throne; and Philagrius,(111) the praefect of Egypt, was instructed to support the new primate with the civil and military powers of the province.
 Oppressed by the conspiracy of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> prelates, <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> withdrew from <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> and passed <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years(112) as an exile and a suppliant on the holy threshold of the Vatican.
(113) By the assiduous study of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> language he soon qualified himself to negotiate with the western clergy; his decent flattery swayed and directed the haughty Julius: the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff was persuaded to consider his appeal as the peculiar interest of the <NORP>Apostolic</NORP> see; and his innocence was unanimously declared in a council of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> bishops of Italy.
 At the end of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years the primate was summoned to the court of <GPE>Milan</GPE> by the emperor Constans, who, in the indulgence of unlawful pleasures, still professed a lively regard for the orthodox faith.
 The cause of truth and justice was promoted by the influence of gold,(114) and the ministers of <NORP>Constans</NORP> advised their sovereign to require the convocation of an ecclesiastical assembly, which might act as the representatives of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 <CARDINAL>Ninety-four</CARDINAL> bishops of the West, <CARDINAL>seventy-six</CARDINAL> bishops of the East, encountered each other at Sardica, on the verge of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, but in the dominions of the protector of Athanasius.
 Their debates soon degenerated into hostile altercations; the Asiatics, apprehensive for their personal safety, retired to <GPE>Philippopolis</GPE> in Thrace; and the rival synods reciprocally hurled their spiritual thunders against their enemies, whom they piously condemned as the enemies of the true God.
 Their decrees were published and ratified in their respective provinces: and Athanasius, who in the <LOC>West</LOC> was revered as a saint, was exposed as a criminal to the abhorrence of the East.
(115) The council of <PERSON>Sardica</PERSON> reveals the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> symptoms of discord and schism between the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Latin</NORP> churches, which were separated by the accidental difference of faith and the permanent distinction of language.
 and restoration, A.
D.
 349 During his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> exile in the West, <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> was frequently admitted to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> presence — at Capua, Lodi, Milan, Verona, Padua, Aquileia, and Treves.
 The bishop of the diocese usually assisted at these interviews; the master of the offices stood before the veil or curtain of the sacred apartment; and the uniform moderation of the primate might be attested by these respectable witnesses, to whose evidence he solemnly appeals.
 (116) <PERSON>Prudence</PERSON> would undoubtedly suggest the mild and respectful tone that became a subject and a bishop.
 In these familiar conferences with the sovereign of the West, <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> might lament the error of Constantius, but he boldly arraigned the guilt of his eunuchs and his <NORP>Arian</NORP> prelates; deplored the distress and danger of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church; and excited <NORP>Constans</NORP> to emulate the zeal and glory of his father.
 The emperor declared his resolution of employing the troops and treasures of <LOC>Europe</LOC> in the orthodox cause; and signified, by a concise and peremptory epistle to his brother Constantius, that, unless he consented to the immediate restoration of Athanasius, he himself, with a fleet and army, would seat the archbishop on the throne of Alexandria.
(117) But this religious war, so horrible to nature, was prevented by the timely compliance of Constantius; and the emperor of the <LOC>East</LOC> condescended to solicit a reconciliation with a subject whom he had injured.
 <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> waited with decent pride till he had received <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> successive epistles full of the strongest assurances of the protection, the favour, and the esteem of his sovereign; who invited him to resume his episcopal seat, and who added the humiliating precaution of engaging his principal ministers to attest the sincerity of his intentions.
 They were manifested in a still more public manner by the strict orders which were despatched into <GPE>Egypt</GPE> to recall the adherents of Athanasius, to restore their privileges, to proclaim their innocence, and to erase from the public registers the illegal proceedings which had been obtained during the prevalence of the <NORP>Eusebian</NORP> faction.
 After every satisfaction and security had been given which justice or even delicacy could require, the primate proceeded, by slow journeys, through the provinces of Thrace, Asia, and Syria; and his progress was marked by the abject homage of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> bishops, who excited his contempt without deceiving his penetration.
(118) At <GPE>Antioch</GPE> he saw the emperor Constantius; sustained, with modest firmness, the embraces and protestations of his master; and eluded the proposal of allowing the <NORP>Arians</NORP> a single church at <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> by claiming, in the other cities of the empire, a similar toleration for his own party; a reply which might have appeared just and moderate in the mouth of an independent prince.
 The entrance of the archbishop into his capital was a triumphal procession; absence and persecution had endeared him to the Alexandrians; his authority, which he exercised with rigour, was more firmly established; and his fame was diffused from <GPE>Ethiopia</GPE> to Britain, over the whole extent of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world(119) Resentment of Constantius, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>351</CARDINAL> But the subject who has reduced his prince to the necessity of dissembling can never expect a sincere and lasting forgiveness; and the tragic fate of <NORP>Constans</NORP> soon deprived <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> of a powerful and generous protector.
 The civil war between the assassin and the only surviving brother of Constans, which afflicted the empire above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, secured an interval of repose to the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> contending parties were desirous to conciliate the friendship of a bishop who, by the weight of his personal authority, might determine the fluctuating resolutions of an important province.
 He gave audience to the ambassadors of the tyrant, with whom he was afterwards accused of holding a secret correspondence; (120) and the emperor <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> repeatedly assured his dearest father, the most reverend Athanasius, that, notwithstanding the malicious rumours which were circulated by their common enemies, he had inherited the sentiments, as well as the throne, of his deceased brother.
(121) Gratitude and humanity would have disposed the primate of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> to deplore the untimely fate of Constans, and to abhor the guilt of Magnentius; but as he clearly understood that the apprehensions of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> were his only safeguard, the fervour of his prayers for the success of the righteous cause might perhaps be somewhat abated.
 The ruin of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> was no longer contrived by the obscure malice of a few bigoted or angry bishops, who abused the authority of a credulous monarch.
 The monarch himself avowed the resolution, which he had so long suppressed, of avenging his private injuries;(122) and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> winter after his victory, which he passed at Arles, was employed against an enemy more odious to him than the vanquished tyrant of Gaul.
 Councils of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and Milan, A.
D.
 353-355 If the emperor had capriciously decreed the death of the most eminent and virtuous citizen of the republic, the cruel order would have been executed without hesitation by the ministers of open violence or of specious injustice.
 The caution, the delay, the difficulty with which he proceeded in the condemnation and punishment of a popular bishop, discovered to the world that the privileges of the church had already revived a sense of order and freedom in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The sentence which was pronounced in the synod of Tyre, and subscribed by a large majority of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> bishops, had never been expressly repealed; and as <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> had been once degraded from his episcopal dignity by the judgment of his brethren, every subsequent act might be considered as irregular, and even criminal.
 But the memory of the firm and effectual support which the primate of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> had derived from the attachment of the <NORP>Western</NORP> church engaged <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> to suspend the execution of the sentence till he had obtained the concurrence of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> bishops.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> years were consumed in ecclesiastical negotiations; and the important cause between the emperor and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his subjects was solemnly debated, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> in the synod of Arles, and afterwards in the great council of Milan,(123) which consisted of above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> bishops.
 Their integrity was gradually undermined by the arguments of the Arians, the dexterity of the eunuchs, and the pressing solicitations of a prince who gratified his revenge at the expense of his dignity, and exposed his own passions whilst he influenced those of the clergy.
 Corruption, the most infallible symptom of constitutional liberty, was successfully practised; honours, gifts, and immunities were offered and accepted as the price of an episcopal vote;(124) and the condemnation of the <NORP>Alexandrian</NORP> primate was artfully represented as the only measure which could restore the peace and union of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 The friends of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> were not, however, wanting to their leader, or to their cause.
 With a manly spirit, which the sanctity of their character rendered less dangerous, they maintained, in public debate, and in private conference with the emperor, the eternal obligation of religion and justice.
 They declared that neither the hope of his favour, nor the fear of his displeasure, should prevail on them to join in the condemnation of an absent, an innocent, a respectable brother.
(125) They affirmed, with apparent reason, that the illegal and obsolete decrees of the council of <GPE>Tyre</GPE> had long since been tacitly abolished by the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> edicts, the honourable re-establishment of the Archbishop of Alexandria, and the silence or recantation of his most clamorous adversaries.
 They alleged that his innocence had been attested by the unanimous bishops of Egypt, and had been acknowledged in the councils of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Sardica(126) by the impartial judgment of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church.
 They deplored the hard condition of Athanasius, who, after enjoying so many years his seat, his reputation, and the seeming confidence of his sovereign, was again called upon to confute the most groundless and extravagant accusations.
 Their language was specious; their conduct was honourable: but in this long and obstinate contest, which fixed the eyes of the whole empire on a single bishop, the ecclesiastical factions were prepared to sacrifice truth and justice to the more interesting object of defending or removing the intrepid champion of the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> faith.
 The <NORP>Arians</NORP> still thought it prudent to disguise, in ambiguous language, their real sentiments and designs; but the orthodox bishops, armed with the favour of the people and the decrees of a general council, insisted on every occasion, and particularly at Milan, that their adversaries should purge themselves from the suspicion of heresy, before they presumed to arraign the conduct of the great Athanasius.
(127) Condemnation of Athanasius, A.
D.
 355.
 But the voice of reason (if reason was indeed on the side of Athanasius) was silenced by the clamours of a factious or venal majority; and the councils of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and <GPE>Milan</GPE> were not dissolved till the archbishop of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> had been solemnly condemned and deposed by the judgment of the Western, as well as of the Eastern, church.
 The bishops who had opposed were required to subscribe the sentence; and to unite in religious communion with the suspected leaders of the adverse party.
 A formulary of consent was transmitted by the messengers of state to the absent bishops: and all those who refused to submit their private opinion to the public and inspired wisdom of the councils of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and <GPE>Milan</GPE> were immediately banished by the emperor, who affected to execute the decrees of the catholic church.
 Among those prelates who led the honourable band of confessors and exiles, <PERSON>Liberius</PERSON> of Rome, <PERSON>Osius</PERSON> of Cordova, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of Treves, <PERSON>Dionysius</PERSON> of Milan, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> of Vercellae, <PERSON>Lucifer</PERSON> of Cagliari, and <PERSON>Hilary</PERSON> of Poitiers, may deserve to be particularly distinguished.
 The eminent station of Liberius, who governed the capital of the empire; the personal merit and long experience of the venerable Osius, who was revered as the favourite of the great Constantine, and the father of the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> faith, placed those prelates at the head of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church: and their example, either of submission or resistance, would probably be imitated by the episcopal crowds.
 But the repeated attempts of the emperor to seduce or to intimidate the bishops of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <PERSON>Cordova</PERSON> were for some time ineffectual.
 The <NORP>Spaniard</NORP> declared himself ready to suffer under Constantius, as he had suffered three-score years before under his grandfather Maximian.
 The Roman, in the presence of his sovereign, asserted the innocence of Athanasius, and his own freedom.
 When he was banished to <GPE>Beraea</GPE> in Thrace, he sent back a large sum which had been offered for the accommodation of his journey; and insulted the court of <GPE>Milan</GPE> by the haughty remark, that the emperor and his eunuchs might want that gold to pay their soldiers and their bishops.
 (128) The resolution of <PERSON>Liberius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Osius</PERSON> was at length subdued by the hardships of exile and confinement.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff purchased his return by some criminal compliances; and afterwards expiated his guilt by a seasonable repentance.
 Persuasion and violence were employed to extort the reluctant signature of the decrepit bishop of Cordova, whose strength was broken, and whose faculties were perhaps impaired, by the weight of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years; and the insolent triumph of the <NORP>Arians</NORP> provoked some of the orthodox party to treat with inhuman severity the character, or rather the memory, of an unfortunate old man, to whose former services <NORP>Christianity</NORP> itself was so deeply indebted.
 (129) Exiles The fall of <PERSON>Liberius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Osius</PERSON> reflected a brighter lustre on the firmness of those bishops who still adhered, with unshaken fidelity, to the cause of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> and religious truth.
 The ingenious malice of their enemies had deprived them of the benefit of mutual comfort and advice, separated those illustrious exiles into distant provinces, and carefully selected the most inhospitable spots of a great empire.
(130) Yet they soon experienced that the deserts of Libya, and the most barbarous tracts of Cappadocia, were less inhospitable than the residence of those cities in which an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop could satiate, without restraint, the exquisite rancour of theological hatred.
 (131) Their consolation was derived from the consciousness of rectitude and independence, from the applause, the visits, the letters, and the liberal alms of their adherents;(132) and from the satisfaction which they soon enjoyed of observing the intestine divisions of the adversaries of the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> faith.
 Such was the nice and capricious taste of the emperor Constantius, and so easily was he offended by the slightest deviation from his imaginary standard of <NORP>Christian</NORP> truth, that he persecuted, with equal zeal, those who defended the consubstantiality, those who asserted the similar substance, and those who denied the likeness, of the <PERSON>Son</PERSON> of God.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> bishops, degraded and banished for those adverse opinions, might possibly meet in the same place of exile; and, according to the difference of their temper, might either pity or insult the blind enthusiasm of their antagonists, whose present sufferings would never be compensated by future happiness.
 <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> expulsion of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> from Alexandria, A.
D.
 356 The disgrace and exile of the orthodox bishops of the <LOC>West</LOC> were designed as so many preparatory steps to the ruin of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> himself.
(133) Six-and-twenty months had elapsed, during which the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court secretly laboured, by the most insidious arts, to remove him from Alexandria, and to withdraw the allowance which supplied his popular liberality.
 But when the primate of Egypt, deserted and proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church, was left destitute of any foreign support, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> despatched <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of his secretaries with a verbal commission to announce and execute the order of his banishment.
 As the justice of the sentence was publicly avowed by the whole party, the only motive which could restrain <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> from giving his messengers the sanction of a written mandate must be imputed to his doubt of the event; and to a sense of the danger to which he might expose the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city and the most fertile province of the empire, if the people should persist in the resolution of defending, by force of arms, the innocence of their spiritual father.
 Such extreme caution afforded <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> a specious pretence respectfully to dispute the truth of an order which he could not reconcile either with the equity or with the former declarations of his gracious master.
 The civil powers of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> found themselves inadequate to the task of persuading or compelling the primate to abdicate his episcopal throne; and they were obliged to conclude a treaty with the popular leaders of Alexandria, by which it was stipulated that all proceedings and all hostilities should be suspended till the emperor's pleasure had been more distinctly ascertained.
 By this seeming moderation the catholics were deceived into a false and fatal security; while the legions of the Upper Egypt, and of Libya, advanced, by secret orders and hasty marches, to besiege, or rather to surprise, a capital habituated to sedition, and inflamed by religious zeal.
(134) The position of Alexandria, between the sea and the lake Mareotis, facilitated the approach and landing of the troops, who were introduced into the heart of the city before any effectual measures could be taken, either to shut the gates, or to occupy the important posts of defence.
 At the hour of midnight, twenty-three days after the signature of the treaty, Syrianus, duke of Egypt, at the head of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> thousand soldiers, armed and prepared for an assault, unexpectedly invested the church of St.
 Theonas, where the archbishop, with a part of his clergy and people, performed their nocturnal devotions.
 The doors of the sacred edifice yielded to the impetuosity of the attack, which was accompanied with every horrid circumstance of tumult and bloodshed; but, as the bodies of the slain, and the fragments of military weapons, remained the next day an unexceptionable evidence in the possession of the catholics, the enterprise of <PERSON>Syrianus</PERSON> may be considered as a successful irruption rather than as an absolute conquest.
 The other churches of the city were profaned by similar outrages; and, during at least <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> months, <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> was exposed to the insults of a licentious army, stimulated by the ecclesiastics of an hostile faction.
 Many of the faithful were killed, who may deserve the name of martyrs if their deaths were neither provoked nor revenged; bishops and presbyters were treated with cruel ignominy; consecrated virgins were stripped naked, scourged, and violated; the houses of wealthy citizens were plundered; and under the mask of religious zeal, lust, avarice, and private resentment were gratified with impunity, and even with applause.
 The <NORP>Pagans</NORP> of Alexandria, who still formed a numerous and discontented party, were easily persuaded to desert a bishop whom they feared and esteemed.
 The hopes of some peculiar favours, and the apprehension of being involved in the general penalties of rebellion, engaged them to promise their support to the destined successor of Athanasius, the famous <PERSON>George</PERSON> of Cappadocia.
 The usurper, after receiving the consecration of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> synod, was placed on the episcopal throne by the arms of Sebastian, who had been appointed count of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> for the execution of that important design.
 In the use, as well as in the acquisition, of power, the tyrant <PERSON>George</PERSON> disregarded the laws of religion, of justice, and of humanity; and the same scenes of violence and scandal which had been exhibited in the capital were repeated in more than ninety episcopal cities of Egypt.
 Encouraged by success, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> ventured to approve the conduct of his ministers.
 By a public and passionate epistle, the emperor congratulates the deliverance of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> from a popular tyrant, who deluded his blind votaries by the magic of his eloquence; expatiates on the virtues and piety of the most reverend George, the elected bishop; and aspires, as the patron and benefactor of the city, to surpass the fame of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> himself.
 But he solemnly declares his unalterable resolution to pursue with fire and sword the seditious adherents of the wicked Athanasius, who, by flying from justice, has confessed his guilt, and escaped the ignominious death which he had so often deserved.
(135) His behaviour <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> had indeed escaped from the most imminent dangers; and the adventures of that extraordinary man deserve and fix our attention.
 On the memorable night when the church of St.
 Theonas was invested by the troops of Syrianus, the archbishop, seated on his throne, expected, with calm and intrepid dignity, the approach of death.
 While the public devotion was interrupted by shouts of rage and cries of terror, he animated his trembling congregation to express their religious confidence by chanting <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the psalms of <PERSON>David</PERSON> which celebrates the triumph of the God of <GPE>Israel</GPE> over the haughty and impious tyrant of Egypt.
 The doors were at length burst open: a cloud of arrows was discharged among the people; the soldiers, with drawn swords, rushed forwards into the sanctuary; and the dreadful gleam of their armour was reflected by the holy luminaries which burnt round the altar.
(136) <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> still rejected the pious importunity of the monks and presbyters who were attached to his person; and nobly refused to desert his episcopal station till he had dismissed in safety the last of the congregation.
 The darkness and tumult of the night favoured the retreat of the archbishop; and though he was oppressed by the waves of an agitated multitude, though he was thrown to the ground, and left without sense or motion, he still recovered his undaunted courage, and eluded the eager search of the soldiers, who were instructed by their <NORP>Arian</NORP> guides that the head of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> would be the most acceptable present to the emperor.
 From that moment the primate of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> disappeared from the eyes of his enemies, and remained above <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years concealed in impenetrable obscurity.
(137) His retreat, A.
D.
 356-362 The despotic power of his implacable enemy filled the whole extent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world and the exasperated monarch had endeavoured, by a very pressing epistle to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes of Ethiopia, to exclude <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> from the most remote and sequestered regions of the earth.
 Counts, praefects, tribunes, whole armies, were successively employed to pursue a bishop and a fugitive; the vigilance of the civil and military powers was excited by the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> edicts; liberal rewards were promised to the man who should produce Athanasius, either alive or dead; and the most severe penalties were denounced against those who should dare to protect the public enemy.
 (138) But the deserts of <GPE>Thebais</GPE> were now peopled by a race of wild, yet submissive fanatics, who preferred the commands of their abbot to the laws of their sovereign.
 The numerous disciples of <PERSON>Antony</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pachomius</PERSON> received the fugitive primate as their father, admired the patience and humility with which he conformed to their strictest institutions, collected every word which dropped from his lips as the genuine effusions of inspired wisdom; and persuaded themselves that their prayers, their fasts, and their vigils, were less meritorious than the zeal which they expressed, and he dangers which they braved, in the defence of truth and innocence.
(139) The monasteries of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> were seated in lonely and desolate places, on the summit of mountains, or in the islands of the Nile; and the sacred horn or trumpet of <GPE>Tabenne</GPE> was the well-known signal which assembled several thousand robust and determined monks, who, for the most part, had been the peasants of the adjacent country.
 When their dark retreats were invaded by a military force which it was impossible to resist, they silently stretched out their necks to the executioner; and supported their national character, that tortures could never wrest from an <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> the confession of a secret which he was resolved not to disclose.
(140) The archbishop of Alexandria, for whose safety they eagerly devoted their lives, was lost among a uniform and well-disciplined multitude; and on the nearer approach of danger, he was swiftly removed, by their officious hands, from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> place of concealment to another, till he reached the formidable deserts, which the gloomy and credulous temper of superstition had peopled with daemons and savage monsters.
 The retirement of Athanasius, which ended only with the life of Constantius, was spent, for the most part, in the society of the monks, who faithfully served him as guards, as secretaries, and as messengers; but the importance of maintaining a more intimate connection with the catholic party tempted him, whenever the diligence of the pursuit was abated, to emerge from the desert, to introduce himself into Alexandria, and to trust his person to the discretion of his friends and adherents.
 His various adventures might have furnished the subject of a very entertaining romance.
 He was once secreted in a dry cistern, which he had scarcely left before he was betrayed by the treachery of a female slave; (141) and he was once concealed in a still more extraordinary asylum, the house of a virgin, only twenty years of age, and who was celebrated in the whole city for her exquisite beauty.
 At the hour of midnight, as she related her story many years afterwards, she was surprised by the appearance of the archbishop in a loose undress, who, advancing with hasty steps, conjured her to afford him the protection which he had been directed by a celestial vision to seek under her hospitable roof.
 The pious maid accepted and preserved the sacred pledge which was intrusted to her prudence and courage.
 Without imparting the secret to any one, she instantly conducted <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> into her most sacred chamber, and watched over his safety with the tenderness of a friend and the assiduity of a servant.
 As long as the danger continued, she regularly supplied him with books and provisions, washed his feet, managed his correspondence, and dexterously concealed from the eye of suspicion this familiar and solitary intercourse between a saint whose character required the most unblemished chastity, and a female whose charms might excite the most dangerous emotions.
(142) During the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years of persecution and exile, <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> repeated his visits to his fair and faithful companion; and the formal declaration, that he saw the councils of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> and Seleucia, (143) forces us to believe that he was secretly present at the time and place of their convocation.
 The advantage of personally negotiating with his friends, and of observing and improving the divisions of his enemies, might justify, in a prudent statesman, so bold and dangerous an enterprise: and <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> was connected by trade and navigation with every seaport of the Mediterranean.
 From the depth of his inaccessible retreat the intrepid primate waged an incessant and offensive war against the protector of the Arians; and his seasonable writings, which were diligently circulated and eagerly perused, contributed to unite and animate the orthodox party.
 In his public apologies, which he addressed to the emperor himself, he sometimes affected the praise of moderation; whilst at the same time, in secret and vehement invectives, he exposed <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> as a weak and wicked prince, the executioner of his family, the tyrant of the republic, and the <NORP>Anti-christ</NORP> of the church.
 In the height of his prosperity, the victorious monarch, who had chastised the rashness of Gallus, and suppressed the revolt of Sylvanus, who had taken the diadem from the head of Vetranio, and vanquished in the field the legions of Magnentius, received from an invisible hand a wound which he could neither heal nor revenge; and the son of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes who experienced the strength of those principles which, in the cause of religion, could resist the most violent exertions of the civil power.
(144) <NORP>Arian</NORP> Bishops The persecution of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> and of so many respectable bishops, who suffered for the truth of their opinions, or at least for the integrity of their conscience, was a just subject of indignation and discontent to all Christians, except those who were blindly devoted to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> faction.
 The people regretted the loss of their faithful pastors, whose banishment was usually followed by the intrustion of a stranger(145) into the episcopal chair, and loudly complained that the right of election was violated, and that they were condemned to obey a mercenary usurper, whose person was unknown and whose principles were suspected.
 The catholics might prove to the world that they were not involved in the guilt and heresy of their ecclesiastical governor, by publicly testifying their dissent, Divisions or by totally separating themselves from his communion.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these methods was invented at Antioch, and practised with such success that it was soon diffused over the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world.
 The doxology, or sacred hymn, which celebrates the glory of the Trinity, is susceptible of very nice, but material, inflections; and the substance of an orthodox or an heretical creed may be expressed by the difference of a disjunctive or a copulative particle.
 Alternate responses and a more regular paslmody (146) were introduced into the public service by <PERSON>Flavianus</PERSON> and Diodorus, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> devout and active laymen, who were attached to the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> faith.
 Under their conduct a swarm of monks issued from the adjacent desert, bands of well-disciplined singers were stationed in the cathedral of Antioch, the Glory to the Father, AND the Son, AND the Holy Ghost (147) was triumphantly chanted by a full chorus of voices, and the catholics insulted, by the purity of their doctrine, the <NORP>Arian</NORP> prelate who had usurped the throne of the venerable Eustathius.
 The same zeal which inspired their songs prompted the more scrupulous members the orthodox party to form separate assemblies which were governed by the presbyters, till the death of their exiled bishop allowed the election and consecration of a new episcopal pastor.
(148) The revolutions of the court multiplied the number of pretenders, and the same city was often disputed, under the reign of Constantius, by two, or three, or even <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> bishops, who exercised their spiritual jurisdiction over their respective followers, and alternately lost and regained temporal possessions of the church.
 The abuse of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> introduced into the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government new causes of tyranny and sedition; the bands of civil society were torn asunder by the fury of religious factions; and the obscure citizen, who might calmly have surveyed the elevation and fall of successive emperors, imagined and experienced that his own life and fortune were connected with the interests of a popular ecclesiastic.
 The example of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> capitals, <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Constantinople, may serve to represent the state of the empire and the temper of mankind under the reign of the sons of Constantine.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> I.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, as long as he maintained his station and his principles, was guarded by the warm attachment of a great people, and could reject with scorn the prayers, the menaces, and the oblations of an heretical prince.
 When the eunuchs had secretly pronounced the exile of Liberius, the well-grounded apprehension of a tumult engaged them to use the utmost precautions in the execution of the sentence.
 The capital was invested on every side, and the praefect was commanded to seize the person of the bishop, either by stratagem or by open force.
 The order was obeyed, and Liberius, with the greatest difficulty, at the hour of midnight, was swiftly conveyed beyond the reach of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people before their consternation was turned into rage.
 As soon as they were informed of his banishment into Thrace, a general assembly was convened, and the clergy of <GPE>Rome</GPE> bound themselves, by a public and solemn oath, never to desert their bishop, never to acknowledge the usurper Felix, who, by the influence of the eunuchs, had been irregularly chosen and consecrated within the walls of a profane palace.
 At the end of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years their pious obstinacy subsisted entire and unshaken; and when <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> visited Rome, he was assailed by the importunate solicitations of a people who had preserved, as the last remnant of their ancient freedom, the right of treating their sovereign with familiar insolence.
 The wives of many of the senators and most honourable citizens, after pressing their husbands to intercede in favour of Liberius, were advised to undertake a commission which in their hands would be less dangerous and might prove more successful.
 The emperor received with politeness these female deputies, whose wealth and dignity were displayed in the magnificence of their dress and ornaments; he admired their inflexible resolution of following their beloved pastor to the most distant regions of the earth, and consented that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bishops, <PERSON>Liberius</PERSON> and Felix, should govern in peace their respective congregations.
 But the ideas of toleration were so repugnant to the practice, and even to the sentiments, of those times, that, when the answer of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was publicly read in the Circus of Rome, so reasonable a project of accommodation was rejected with contempt and ridicule.
 The eager vehemence which animated the spectators on the decisive moment of a horserace was now directed towards a different object, and the Circus resounded with the shout of thousands, who repeatedly exclaimed "One God, <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> Christ, <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> Bishop!" The zeal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people in the cause of <PERSON>Liberius</PERSON> was not confined to words alone, and the dangerous and bloody sedition which they excited soon after the departure of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> determined that prince to accept the submission of the exiled prelate, and to restore him to the undivided dominion of the capital.
 After some ineffectual resistance, his rival was expelled from the city by the permission of the emperor and the power of the opposite faction; the adherents of <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> were inhumanly murdered in the streets, in the public places, in the baths, and even in the churches; and the face of Rome, upon the return of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> bishop, renewed the horrid image of the massacres of <PERSON>Marius</PERSON> and the proscriptions of Sylla.
(149) <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> II.
 Notwithstanding the rapid increase of <NORP>Christians</NORP> under the reign of the <NORP>Flavian</NORP> family, Rome, Alexandria, and the other great cities of the empire, still contained a strong and powerful faction of Infidels, who envied the prosperity, and who ridiculed, even in their theatres, the theological disputes of the church.
 <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> alone enjoyed the advantage of being born and educated in the bosom of the faith.
 The capital of the <LOC>East</LOC> had never been polluted by the worship of idols, and the whole body of the people had deeply imbibed the opinions, the virtues, and the passions which distinguished the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of that age from the rest of mankind.
 After the death of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the episcopal throne was disputed by <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> and Macedonius.
 By their zeal and abilities they both deserved the eminent station to which they aspired; and if the moral character of <PERSON>Macedonius</PERSON> was less exceptionable, his competitor had the advantage of a prior election and a more orthodox doctrine.
 His firm attachment to the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> creed, which has given <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> a place in the calendar among saints and martyrs, exposed him to the resentment of the Arians.
 In the space of fourteen years he was <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times driven from his throne, to which he was more frequently restored by the violence of the people than by the permission of the prince, and the power of <PERSON>Macedonius</PERSON> could be secured only by the death of his rival.
 The unfortunate <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> was dragged in chains from the sandy deserts of <LOC>Mesopotamia</LOC> to the most desolate places of Mount Taurus,(150) confined in a dark and narrow dungeon, left <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days without food, and at length strangled, by the order of Philip, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the principal ministers of the emperor Constantius.
(151) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> blood which stained the new capital was spilt in this ecclesiastical contest, and many persons were slain on both sides in the furious and obstinate seditions of the people.
 The commission of enforcing a sentence of banishment against <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> had been intrusted to Hermogenes, the master-general of the cavalry, but the execution of it was fatal to himself.
 The catholics rose in the defence of their bishop; the palace of <PERSON>Hermogenes</PERSON> was consumed; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> military officer of the empire was dragged by the heels through the streets of Constantinople, and, after he expired, his lifeless corpse was exposed to their wanton insults.
 (152) The fate of <PERSON>Hermogenes</PERSON> instructed Philip, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, to act with more precaution on a similar occasion.
 In the most gentle and honourable terms he required the attendance of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> in the baths of Zeuxippus, which had a private communication with the palace and the sea.
 A vessel, which lay ready at the garden stairs, immediately hoisted sail, and, while the people were still ignorant of the meditated sacrilege, their bishop was already embarked on his voyage to Thessalonica.
 They soon beheld, with surprise and indignation, the gates of the palace thrown open, and the usurper <PERSON>Macedonius</PERSON> seated by the side of the praefect on a lofty chariot, which was surrounded by troops of guards with drawn swords.
 The military procession advanced towards the cathedral, and the <NORP>Arians</NORP> and the catholics eagerly rushed to occupy that important post, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> persons lost their lives in the confusion of the tumult.
 Macedonius, who was supported by a regular force, obtained a decisive victory, but his reign was disturbed by clamour and sedition, and the causes which appeared the least connected with the subject of dispute were sufficient to nourish and to kindle the flame of civil discord.
 As the chapel in which the body of the great <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had been deposited was in a ruinous condition, the bishop transported those venerable remains into the church of St.
 Acacius.
 This prudent and even pious measure was represented as a wicked profanation by the whole party which adhered to the <NORP>Homoousian</NORP> doctrine.
 The factions immediately flew to arms, the consecrated ground was used as their field of battle, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ecclesiastical historians has observed, as a real fact, not as a figure of rhetoric, that the well before the church overflowed with a stream of blood which filled the porticoes and the adjacent courts.
 The writer who should impute these tumults solely to a religious principle would betray a very imperfect knowledge of human nature; yet it must be confessed that the motive which misled the sincerity of zeal, and the pretence which disguised the licentiousness of passion, suppressed the remorse which, in another cause, would have succeeded to the rage of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of Constantinople.
(153) Cruelty of the <NORP>Arians</NORP> The cruel and arbitrary disposition of Constantius, which did not always require the provocations of guilt and resistance, was justly exasperated by the tumults of his capital and the criminal behaviour of a faction which opposed the authority and religion of their sovereign The ordinary punishments of death, exile, and confiscation were inflicted with partial rigour, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> still revere the holy memory of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> clerks, a reader and a subdeacon, who were accused of the murder of Hermogenes, and beheaded at the gates of Constantinople.
 By an edict of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> against the catholics, which has not been judged worthy of a place in the <NORP>Theodosian</NORP> code, those who refused to communicate with the <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishops, and particularly with Macedonius, were deprived of the immunities of ecclesiastics and of the rights of Christians; they were compelled to relinquish the possession of the churches, and were strictly prohibited from holding their assemblies within the walls of the city.
 The execution of this unjust law in the provinces of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor was committed to the zeal of Macedonius; the civil and military powers were directed to obey his commands; and the cruelties exercised by this <NORP>Semi-Arian</NORP> tyrant in the support of the <ORG>Homoiousion</ORG> exceeded the commission and disgraced the reign of Constantius.
 The sacraments of the church were administered to the reluctant victims, who denied the vocation and abhorred the principles of Macedonius.
 The rites of baptism were conferred on women and children who, for that purpose, had been torn from the arms of their friends and parents; the mouths of the communicants were held open by a wooden engine while the consecrated bread was forced down their throat; the breasts of tender virgins were either burnt with red-hot eggshells, or inhumanly compressed between sharp and heavy boards.
(154) The <NORP>Novatians</NORP> of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the adjacent country, by their firm attachment to the <NORP>Homoousian</NORP> standard, deserved to be confounded with the catholics themselves.
 <PERSON>Macedonius</PERSON> was informed that a large district of <GPE>Paphlagonia</GPE> was almost entirely inhabited by those sectaries.
 He resolved either to convert or to extirpate them, and, as he distrusted on this occasion the efficacy of an ecclesiastical mission, he commanded a body of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand legionaries to march against the rebels, and to reduce the territory of <GPE>Mantinium</GPE> (155) under his spiritual dominion.
 The <NORP>Novatian</NORP> peasants, animated by despair and religious fury, boldly encountered the invaders of their country, and, though many of the <NORP>Paphlagonians</NORP> were slain, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions were vanquished by an irregular multitude, armed only with scythes and axes, and, except a few who escaped by an ignominious flight, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand soldiers were left dead on the field of battle.
 The successor of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> has expressed, in a concise but lively manner, some of the theological calamities which afflicted the empire, and more especially the East, in the reign of a prince who was the slave of his own passions, and of those of his eunuchs.
 The revolt and fury of the <NORP>Donatists</NORP> Circumcellions, A.
D.
 345 etc While the flames of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> controversy consumed the vitals of the empire, the <NORP>African</NORP> provinces were infested by their peculiar enemies, the savage fanatics, who, under the name of Circumcellions, formed the strength and scandal of the <NORP>Donatist</NORP> party.
 (157) The severe execution of the laws of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had excited a spirit of discontent and resistance; the strenuous efforts of his son <NORP>Constans</NORP> to restore the unity of the church exasperated the sentiments of mutual hatred which had <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> occasioned the separation; and the methods of force and corruption employed by the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Imperial</NORP> commissioners, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> and Macarius, furnished the schismatics with a specious contrast between the maxims of the apostles and the conduct of their pretended successors.
 (158) The peasants who inhabited the villages of <NORP>Numidia</NORP> and <GPE>Mauritania</GPE> were a ferocious race, who had been imperfectly reduced under the authority of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> laws, who were imperfectly converted to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith, but who were actuated by a blind and furious enthusiasm in the cause of their <NORP>Donatist</NORP> teachers.
 They indignantly supported the exile of their bishops, the demolition of their churches, and the interruption of their secret assemblies.
 The violence of the officers of justice, who were usually sustained by a military guard, was sometimes repelled with equal violence, and the blood of some popular ecclesiastics, which had been shed in the quarrel, inflamed their rude followers with an eager desire of revenging the death of these holy martyrs.
 By their own cruelty and rashness the ministers of persecution sometimes provoked their fate, and the guilt of an accidental tumult precipitated the criminals into despair and rebellion.
 Driven from their native villages, the <NORP>Donatist</NORP> peasants assembled in formidable gangs on the edge of the Gaetulian desert, and readily exchanged the habits of labor for a life of idleness and rapine, which was consecrated by the name of religion, and faintly condemned by the doctors of the sect.
 The leaders of the <PERSON>Circumcellions</PERSON> assumed the title of captains of the saints; their principal weapon, as they were indifferently provided with swords and spears, was a huge and weighty club, which they termed an 'Israelite', and the well-known sound of "Praise be to God!" which they used as their cry of war, diffused consternation over the unarmed provinces of Africa.
 At <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> their depredations were coloured by the plea of necessity, but they soon exceeded the measure of subsistence, indulged without control their intemperance and avarice, burnt the villages which they had pillaged, and reigned the licentious tyrants of the open country.
 The occupations of husbandry and the administration of justice were interrupted; and, as the <PERSON>Circumcellions</PERSON> pretended to restore the primitive equality of mankind, and to reform the abuses of civil society, they opened a secure asylum for the slaves and debtors who flocked in crowds to their holy standard.
 When they were not resisted they usually contented themselves with plunder, but the slightest opposition provoked them to acts of violence and murder; and some catholic priests, who had imprudently signalised their zeal, were tortured by the fanatics with the most refined and wanton barbarity.
 The spirit of the <PERSON>Circumcellions</PERSON> was not always exerted against their defenceless enemies; they engaged, and sometimes defeated, the troops of the province, and in the bloody action of <GPE>Bagai</GPE> they attacked in the open field, but with unsuccessful valour, an advanced guard of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> cavalry.
 The <NORP>Donatists</NORP> who were taken in arms received, and they soon deserved, the same treatment which might have been shown to the wild beasts of the desert.
 The captives died, without a murmur, either by the sword, the axe, or the fire; and the measures of retaliation were multiplied in a rapid proportion, which aggravated the horrors of rebellion and excluded the hope of mutual forgiveness.
 In the beginning of the present century the example of the <PERSON>Circumcellions</PERSON> has been renewed in the persecution, the boldness, the crimes and the enthusiasm of the Camisards; and if the fanatics of <GPE>Languedoc</GPE> surpassed those of <NORP>Numidia</NORP> by their military achievements, the <NORP>Africans</NORP> maintained their fierce independence with more resolution and perseverance.
(159) Their religious suicides Such disorders are the natural effects of religious tyranny; but the rage of the <NORP>Donatists</NORP> was inflamed by a frenzy of a very extraordinary kind; and which, if it really prevailed among them in so extravagant a degree, cannot surely be paralleled in any country or in any age.
 Many of these fanatics were possessed with the horror of life, and the desire of martyrdom; and they deemed it of little moment by what means, or by what hands, they perished, if their conduct was sanctified by the intention of devoting themselves to the glory of the true faith, and the hope of eternal happiness.
 (160) Sometimes they rudely disturbed the festivals, and profaned the temples of Paganism, with the design of exciting the most zealous of the idolaters to revenge the insulted honour of their gods.
 They sometimes forced their way into the courts of justice, and compelled the affrighted judge to give orders for their immediate execution.
 They frequently stopped travellers on the public highways, and obliged them to inflict the stroke of martyrdom, by the promise of a reward if they consented, and by the threat of instant death if they refused to grant so very singular a favor.
 When they were disappointed of every other resource, they announced the day on which, in the presence of their friends and brethren, they should cast themselves headlong from some lofty rock; and many precipices were shown which had acquired fame by the number of religious suicides.
 In the actions of these desperate enthusiasts, who were admired by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> party as the martyrs of God, and abhorred by the other as the victims of Satan, an impartial philosopher may discover the influence and the last abuse of that inflexible spirit which was originally derived from the character and principals of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> nation.
 General character of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> sects, A.
D.
 312-361.
 The simple narrative of the intestine divisions which distracted the peace and dishonoured the triumph of the church, will confirm the remark of a <NORP>Pagan</NORP> historian, and justify the complaint of a venerable bishop.
 The experience of <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> had convinced him that the enmity of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> towards each other surpassed the fury of savage beasts against man; (161) and <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> Nazianzen most pathetically laments that the kingdom of heaven was converted by discord into the image of chaos, of a nocturnal tempest, and of hell itself.
 (162) The fierce and partial writers of the times, ascribing all virtue to themselves, and imputing all guilt to their adversaries, have painted the battle of the angels and daemons.
 Our calmer reason will reject such pure and perfect monsters of vice or sanctity, and will impute an equal, or at least an indiscriminate, measure of good and evil to the hostile sectaries, who assumed and bestowed the appellations of orthodox and heretics.
 They had been educated in the same religion and the same civil society.
 Their hopes and fears in the present, or in a future life, were balanced in the same proportion.
 On either side the error might be innocent, the faith sincere, the practice meritorious or corrupt.
 Their passions were excited by similar objects; and they might alternately abuse the favour of the court, or of the people.
 The metaphysical opinions of the <NORP>Athanasians</NORP> and the <NORP>Arians</NORP> could not influence their moral character; and they were alike actuated by the intolerant spirit which has been extracted from the pure and simple maxims of the Gospel.
 Toleration of paganism A modern writer, who, with a just confidence, has prefixed to his own history the honourable epithets of political and philosophical, (163) accuses the timid prudence of Montesquieu, for neglecting to enumerate, among the causes of the decline of the empire, a law of Constantine, by which the exercise of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> worship was absolutely suppressed, and a considerable part of his subjects was left destitute of priests, temples, and of any public religion.
 The zeal of the philosophic historian for the rights of mankind has induced him to acquiesce in the ambiguous testimony of those ecclesiastics who have too lightly ascribed to their favourite hero the merit of a general persecution.
(164) Instead of alleging this imaginary law, which would have blazed in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> codes, we may safely appeal to the original epistle which <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> addressed to the followers of the ancient religion, at a time when he no long disguised his conversion, nor dreaded the rivals of his throne.
 He invites and exhorts, in the most pressing terms, the subjects of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire to imitate the exampleby Constantine, of their master; but he declares that those who still refuse to open their eyes to the celestial light may free enjoy their temples and their fancied gods.
 A report that the ceremonies of <NORP>Paganism</NORP> were suppressed is formally contradicted by the emperor himself, who wisely assigns, as the principle of his moderation, the invincible force of habit, of prejudice, and of superstition.
 (165) Without violating the sanctity of his promise, without alarming the fears of the Pagans, the artful monarch advanced, by slow and cautious steps, to undermine the irregular and decayed fabric of polytheism.
 The partial acts of severity which he occasionally exercised, though they were secretly prompted by a <NORP>Christian</NORP> zeal, were coloured by the fairest pretences of justice and the public good; and while <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> designed to ruin the foundations, he seemed to reform the abuses, of the ancient religion.
 After the example of the wisest of his predecessors, he condemned, under the most rigorous penalties, the occult and impious arts of divination, which excited the vain hopes, and sometimes the criminal attempts, of those who were discontented with their present condition.
 An ignominious silence was imposed on the oracles, which had been publicly convicted of fraud and falsehood; the effeminate priests of the <LOC>Nile</LOC> were abolished; and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> discharged the duties of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> censor, when he gave orders for the demolition of several temples of Phoenicia, in which every mode of prostitution was devoutly practised in the face of day, and to the honour of Venus.
(166) The <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was, in some measure, raised at the expense, and was adorned with the spoils, of the opulent temples of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; the sacred property; was confiscated; the statues of gods and heroes were transported, with rude familiarity, among a people who considered them as objects, not of adoration, but of curiosity; the gold and silver were restored to circulation; and the magistrates, the bishops, and the eunuchs, improved the fortunate occasion of gratifying, at once, their zeal, their avarice, and their resentment.
 But these depredations were confined to a small part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; and the provinces had been long since accustomed to endure the same sacrilegious rapine, from the tyranny of princes and proconsuls who could not be suspected of any design to subvert the established religion.
(167) and his sons.
 The sons of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of their father with more zeal and with less discretion.
 The pretences of rapine and oppression were insensibly multiplied (168); every indulgence was shown to the illegal behaviour of the Christians; every doubt was explained to the disadvantage of Paganism, and the demolition of the temples was celebrated as <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the auspicious events of the reign of <NORP>Constans</NORP> and Constantius.
 (169) The name of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> is prefixed to a concise law, which might have superseded the necessity of any future prohibitions.
 But there is the strongest reason to believe that this formidable edict was either composed without being published, or was published without being executed.
 The evidence of facts, and the monuments which are still extant of brass and marble, continue to prove the public exercise of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> worship during the whole reign of the sons of Constantine.
 In the <LOC>East</LOC> as well as in the West, in cities as well as in the country, a great number of temples were respected, or at least were spared; and the devout multitude still enjoyed the luxury of sacrifices, of festivals, and of processions, by the permission, or by the connivance, of the civil government.
 About <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years after the supposed date of his bloody edict, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> visited the temples of Rome; and the decency of his behaviour is recommended by a <NORP>Pagan</NORP> orator as an example worthy of the imitation of succeeding princes.
 The senate still presumed to consecrate, by solemn decrees, the divine memory of their sovereigns; and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> himself was associated, after death, to those gods whom he had renounced and insulted during his life.
 The title, the ensigns, the prerogatives, of SOVEREIGN PONTIFF, which had been instituted by Numa, and assumed by Augustus, were accepted, without hesitation, by <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperors, who were invested with a more absolute authority over the religion which they had deserted than over that which they professed.
 (172) The divisions of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> suspended the ruin of Paganism; (173) and the holy war against the infidels was less vigorously prosecuted by princes and bishops who were more immediately alarmed by the guilt and danger of domestic rebellion.
 The extirpation of idolatry (174) might have been justified by the established principles of intolerance: but the hostile sects, which alternately reigned in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court, were mutually apprehensive of alienating, and perhaps exasperating, the minds of a powerful, though declining faction.
 Every motive of authority and fashion, of interest and reason, now militated on the side of Christianity; but <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> generations elapsed before their victorious influence was universally felt.
 The religion which had so long and so lately been established in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was still revered by a numerous people, less attached indeed to speculative opinion than to ancient custom.
 The honours of the state and army were indifferently bestowed on all the subjects of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Constantius; and a considerable portion of knowledge and wealth and valour was still engaged in the service of polytheism.
 The superstition of the senator and of the peasant, of the poet and the philosopher, was derived from very different causes, but they met with equal devotion in the temples of the gods.
 Their zeal was insensibly provoked by the insulting triumph of a proscribed sect; and their hopes we revived by the well-grounded confidence that the presumptive heir of the empire, a young and valiant hero, who had delivered <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> from the arms of the barbarians, had secretly embraced the religion of his ancestors.
