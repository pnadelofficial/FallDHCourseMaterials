 Their progress was favoured by the caliphs, their unknown and accidental auxiliaries: the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions were occupied in Asia; and after the loss of Syria, Egypt, and Africa, the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> were twice reduced to the danger and disgrace of defending their capital against the Saracens.
 If, in the account of this interesting people, I have deviated from the strict and original line of my undertaking, the merit of the subject will hide my transgression, or solicit my excuse.
 In the East, in the West, in war, in religion, in science, in their prosperity, and in their decay, the <NORP>Arabians</NORP> press themselves on our curiosity: the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> overthrow of the church and empire of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> may be imputed to their arms; and the disciples of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> still hold the civil and religious sceptre of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> world.
 But the same labour would be unworthily bestowed on the swarms of savages, who, between the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> and the twelfth century, descended from the plains of Scythia, in transient inroad or perpetual emigration.
 (1) Their names are uncouth, their origins doubtful, their actions obscure, their superstition was blind, their valour brutal, and the uniformity of their public and private lives was neither softened by innocence nor refined by policy.
 The majesty of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne repelled and survived their disorderly attacks; the greater part of these <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> has disappeared without leaving any memorial of their existence, and the despicable remnant continues, and may long continue, to groan under the dominion of a foreign tyrant.
 From the antiquities of, 1.
Bulgarians, 2.
 Hungarians, and, 3.
 Russians, I shall content myself with selecting such facts as yet deserve to be remembered.

 Emigration of the Bulgarians, A.
D.
 680, etc In his march to Italy, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> (2) the <PERSON>Ostrogoth</PERSON> had trampled on the arms of the Bulgarians.
 After this defeat, the name and the nation are lost during a century and a half; and it may be suspected that the same or a similar appellation was revived by strange colonies from the Borysthenes, the Tanais, or the Volga.
 A king of the ancient <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> (3), bequeathed to his <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> sons a last lesson of moderation and concord.
 It was received as youth has ever received the counsels of age and experience: the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> princes buried their father; divided his subjects and cattle; forgot his advice; separated from each other; and wandered in quest of fortune till we find the most adventurous in the heart of Italy, under the protection of the exarch of Ravenna.
 (4) But the stream of emigration was directed or impelled towards the capital.
 The modern Bulgaria, along the southern banks of the Danube, was stamped with the name and image which it has retained to the present hour: the new conquerors successively acquired, by war or treaty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces of Dardania, Thessaly, and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Epirus; (5) the ecclesiastical supremacy was translated from the native city of Justinian; and, in their prosperous age, the obscure town of Lychnidus, or Achrida, was honoured with the throne of a king and a patriarch.
 (6) The unquestionable evidence of language attests the descent of the <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> from the original stock of the Sclavonian, or more properly Slavonian, race; (7) and the kindred bands of Servians, Bosnians, Rascians, Croatians, Walachians, (8) etc.
, followed either the standard or the example of the leading tribe.
 From the <NORP>Euxine</NORP> to the Adriatic, in the state of captives, or subjects, or allies, or enemies, of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire, they overspread the land; and the national appellation of the SLAVES (9) has been degraded by chance or malice from the signification of glory to that of servitude.
 (10) <NORP>Croats</NORP> or <NORP>Sclavonians</NORP> of Dalmatia, A.
D.
 900, etc.
 Among these colonies, the Chrobatians, (11) or Croats, who now attend the motions of an <NORP>Austrian</NORP> army, are the descendants of a mighty people, the conquerors and sovereigns of Dalmatia.
 The maritime cities, and of these the infant republic of Ragusa, implored the aid and instructions of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court: they were advised by the magnanimous <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> to reserve a small acknowledgment of their fidelity to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, and to appease, by an <DATE>annual</DATE> tribute, the wrath of these irresistible Barbarians.
 The kingdom of <GPE>Crotia</GPE> was shared by <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> Zoupans, or feudatory lords; and their united forces were numbered at <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> thousand horse and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand foot.
 A long sea-coast, indented with capacious harbours, covered with a string of islands, and almost in sight of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shores, disposed both the natives and strangers to the practice of navigation.
 The boats or brigantines of the <NORP>Croats</NORP> were constructed after the fashion of the old Liburnians: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty vessels may excite the idea of a respectable navy; but our seamen will smile at the allowance of ten, or twenty, or forty, men for each of these ships of war.
 They were gradually converted to the more honourable service of commerce; yet the <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> pirates were still frequent and dangerous; and it was not before the close of the tenth century that the freedom and sovereignty of the <LOC>Gulf</LOC> were effectually vindicated by the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> republic.
 (12) The ancestors of these <NORP>Dalmatian</NORP> kings were equally removed from the use and abuse of navigation: they dwelt in the White Croatia, in the inland regions of <LOC>Silesia</LOC> and Little Poland, thirty days' journey, according to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> computation, from the sea of darkness.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> kingdom of the Bulgarians, A.
D.
 640-1017.
 1.
 The glory of the <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> (13) was confined to a narrow scope both of time and place.
 In the ninth and tenth centuries, they reigned to the south of the Danube; but the more powerful nations that had followed their emigration repelled all return to the north and all progress to the west.
 Yet in the obscure catalogue of their exploits, they might boast an honour which had hitherto been appropriated to the Goths: that of slaying in battle <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the successors of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Constantine.
 The emperor <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> had lost his fame in the Arabian, he lost his life in the Sclavonian, war.
 In his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> operations he advanced with boldness and success into the centre of Bulgaria, and burnt the royal court, which was probably no more than an edifice and village of timber.
 But while he searched the spoil and refused all offers of treaty, his enemies collected their spirits and their forces: the passes of retreat were insuperably barred; and the trembling <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> was heard to exclaim, "Alas, alas! unless we could assume the wings of birds, we cannot hope to escape.
" Two days he waited his fate in the inactivity of despair; but, on the morning of the third, the <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> surprised the camp, and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> prince, with the great officers of the empire, were slaughtered in their tents.
 A.
D.
811.
 The body of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> had been saved from insult; but the head of <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> was exposed on a spear, and his skull, enchased with gold, was often replenished in the feasts of victory.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> bewailed the dishonour of the throne; but they acknowledged the just punishment of avarice and cruelty.
 This savage cup was deeply tinctured with the manners of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wilderness; but they were softened before the end of the same century by a peaceful intercourse with the Greeks, the possession of a cultivated region, and the introduction of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 The nobles of <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> were educated in the schools and palace of Constantinople; and Simeon, (14) a youth of the royal line, was instructed in the rhetoric of <PERSON>Demosthenes</PERSON> and the logic of Aristotle.
 A.
D.
888-927, 0r 932.
 He relinquished the profession of a monk for that of a king and warrior; and in his reign of more than <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> assumed a rank among the civilized powers of the earth.
 The Greeks, whom he repeatedly attacked, derived a faint consolation from indulging themselves in the reproaches of perfidy and sacrilege.
 They purchased the aid of the Pagan Turks; but Simeon, in a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> battle, redeemed the loss of the first, at a time when it was esteemed a victory to elude the arms of that formidable nation.
 The <NORP>Servians</NORP> were overthrown, made captive and dispersed; and those who visited the country before their restoration could discover no more than fifty vagrants, without women or children, who extorted a precarious subsistence from the chase.
 On classic ground, on the banks of Achelous, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were defeated; their horn was broken by the strength of the Barbaric Hercules.
 (15) He formed the siege of Constantinople; and, in a personal conference with the emperor, <PERSON>Simeon</PERSON> imposed the conditions of peace.
 They met with the most jealous precautions: the royal gallery was drawn close to an artificial and well-fortified platform; and the majesty of the purple was emulated by the pomp of the Bulgarian.
 The reconciliation was sealed by a domestic alliance; the freedom of trade was granted or restored; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> honours of the court were secured to the friends of Bulgaria, above the ambassadors of enemies or strangers; (16) A.
D.
950, etc.
 and her princes were dignified with the high and invidious title of Basileus, or emperor.
 But this friendship was soon disturbed: after the death of Simeon, the nations were again in arms; his feeble successors were divided and extinguished; and, in the beginning of the eleventh century, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Basil, who was born in the purple, deserved the appellation of conqueror of the Bulgarians.
 His avarice was in some measure gratified by a treasure of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand pounds sterling, (ten thousand pounds' weight of gold,) which he found in the palace of Lychnidus.
 His cruelty inflicted a cool and exquisite vengeance on fifteen thousand captives who had been guilty of the defence of their country.
 They were deprived of sight; but to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of each <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> a single eye was left, that he might conduct his blind century to the presence of their king.
 Their king is said to have expired of grief and horror; the nation was awed by this terrible example; the <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> were swept away from their settlements, and circumscribed within a narrow province; the surviving chiefs bequeathed to their children the advice of patience and the duty of revenge.
 Emigration of the Turks, or Hungarians, A.
D.
 884.
 2.
 When the black swarm of <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> hung over Europe, above nine <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years after the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aera, they were mistaken by fear and superstition for the <PERSON>Gog</PERSON> and <PERSON>Magog</PERSON> of the Scriptures, the signs and forerunners of the end of the world.
 (17) Since the introduction of letters, they have explored their own antiquities with a strong and laudable impulse of patriotic curiosity.
 (18) Their rational criticism can no longer be amused with a vain pedigree of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> and the Huns; but they complain that their primitive records have perished in the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> war; that the truth or fiction of their rustic songs is long since forgotten; and that the fragments of a rude chronicle (19) must be painfully reconciled with the contemporary though foreign intelligence of the imperial geographer.
 (20) <PERSON>Magiar</PERSON> is the national and oriental denomination of the Hungarians; but, among the tribes of Scythia, they are distinguished by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> under the proper and peculiar name of Turks, as the descendants of that mighty people who had conquered and reigned from <GPE>China</GPE> to the Volga.
 The Pannonian colony preserved a correspondence of trade and amity with the eastern <NORP>Turks</NORP> on the confines of <LOC>Persia</LOC> and after a separation of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty years, the missionaries of the king of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> discovered and visited their ancient country near the banks of the Volga.
 They were hospitably entertained by a people of <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and <NORP>Savages</NORP> who still bore the name of Hungarians; conversed in their native tongue, recollected a tradition of their long-lost brethren, and listened with amazement to the marvellous tale of their new kingdom and religion.
 The zeal of conversion was animated by the interest of consanguinity; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the greatest of their princes had formed the generous, though fruitless, design of replenishing the solitude of <GPE>Pannonia</GPE> by this domestic colony from the heart of Tartary.
 (21) From this primitive country they were driven to the <LOC>West</LOC> by the tide of war and emigration, by the weight of the more distant tribes, who at the same time were fugitives and conquerors.
 Reason or fortune directed their course towards the frontiers of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire: they halted in the usual stations along the banks of the great rivers; and in the territories of Moscow, Kiow, and Moldavia, some vestiges have been discovered of their temporary residence.
 In this long and various peregrination, they could not always escape the dominion of the stronger; and the purity of their blood was improved or sullied by the mixture of a foreign race: from a motive of compulsion, or choice, several tribes of the <NORP>Chazars</NORP> were associated to the standard of their ancient vassals; introduced the use of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> language; and obtained by their superior renown the most honourable place in the front of battle.
 The military force of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and their allies marched in <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> equal and artificial divisions; each division was formed of thirty thousand <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty-seven warriors, and the proportion of women, children, and servants, supposes and requires at least a million of emigrants.
 Their public counsels were directed by <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> vayvods, or hereditary chiefs; but the experience of discord and weakness recommended the more simple and vigorous administration of a single person.
 The sceptre, which had been declined by the modest Lebedias, was granted to the birth or merit of <PERSON>Almus</PERSON> and his son Arpad, and the authority of the supreme khan of the <NORP>Chazars</NORP> confirmed the engagement of the prince and people; of the people to obey his commands, of the prince to consult their happiness and glory.
 Their <NORP>Fennic</NORP> origin.
 With this narrative we might be reasonably content, if the penetration of modern learning had not opened a new and larger prospect of the antiquities of nations.
 The <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> language stands alone, and as it were insulated, among the <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> dialects; but it bears a close and clear affinity to the idioms of the <NORP>Fennic</NORP> race, (22) of an obsolete and savage race, which formerly occupied the northern regions of <LOC>Asia</LOC> and Europe.
 The genuine appellation of <GPE>Ugri</GPE> or Igours is found on the western confines of China; (23) their migration to the banks of the <NORP>Irtish</NORP> is attested by <NORP>Tartar</NORP> evidence; (24) a similar name and language are detected in the southern parts of Siberia; (25) and the remains of the <NORP>Fennic</NORP> tribes are widely, though thinly scattered from the sources of the <PERSON>Oby</PERSON> to the shores of Lapland.
 (26) The consanguinity of the <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> and <NORP>Laplanders</NORP> would display the powerful energy of climate on the children of a common parent; the lively contrast between the bold adventurers who are intoxicated with the wines of the Danube, and the wretched fugitives who are immersed beneath the snows of the polar circle.
 Arms and freedom have ever been the ruling, though too often the unsuccessful, passion of the Hungarians, who are endowed by nature with a vigorous constitution of soul and body.
 (27) Extreme cold has diminished the stature and congealed the faculties of the Laplanders; and the arctic tribes, alone among the sons of men, are ignorant of war, and unconscious of human blood; a happy ignorance, if reason and virtue were the guardians of their peace! (28) Tactics and manners of the <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> and Bulgarians, A.
D.
 900, etc.
 It is the observation of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> author of the Tactics, (29) that all the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> hordes resembled each other in their pastoral and military life, that they all practised the same means of subsistence, and employed the same instruments of destruction.
 But he adds, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations of <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> and <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> were superior to their brethren, and similar to each other in the improvements, however rude, of their discipline and government: their visible likeness determines <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> to confound his friends and enemies in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> common description; and the picture may be heightened by some strokes from their contemporaries of the tenth century.
 Except the merit and fame of military prowess, all that is valued by mankind appeared vile and contemptible to these Barbarians, whose native fierceness was stimulated by the consciousness of numbers and freedom.
 The tents of the <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> were of leather, their garments of fur; they shaved their hair, and scarified their faces: in speech they were slow, in action prompt, in treaty perfidious; and they shared the common reproach of Barbarians, too ignorant to conceive the importance of truth, too proud to deny or palliate the breach of their most solemn engagements.
 Their simplicity has been praised; yet they abstained only from the luxury they had never known; whatever they saw they coveted; their desires were insatiate, and their sole industry was the hand of violence and rapine.
 By the definition of a pastoral nation, I have recalled a long description of the economy, the warfare, and the government that prevail in that state of society; I may add, that to fishing, as well as to the chase, the <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> were indebted for a part of their subsistence; and since they seldom cultivated the ground, they must, at least in their new settlements, have sometimes practised a slight and unskilful husbandry.
 In their emigrations, perhaps in their expeditions, the host was accompanied by <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of sheep and oxen which increased the cloud of formidable dust, and afforded a constant and wholesale supply of milk and animal food.
 A plentiful command of forage was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> care of the general, and if the flocks and herds were secure of their pastures, the hardy warrior was alike insensible of danger and fatigue.
 The confusion of men and cattle that overspread the country exposed their camp to a nocturnal surprise, had not a still wider circuit been occupied by their light cavalry, perpetually in motion to discover and delay the approach of the enemy.
 After some experience of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tactics, they adopted the use of the sword and spear, the helmet of the soldier, and the iron breastplate of his steed: but their native and deadly weapon was the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> bow: from the earliest infancy their children and servants were exercised in the double science of archery and horsemanship; their arm was strong; their aim was sure; and in the most rapid career, they were taught to throw themselves backwards, and to shoot a volley of arrows into the air.
 In open combat, in secret ambush, in flight, or pursuit, they were equally formidable; an appearance of order was maintained in the foremost ranks, but their charge was driven forwards by the impatient pressure of succeeding crowds.
 They pursued, headlong and rash, with loosened reins and horrific outcries; but, if they fled, with real or dissembled fear, the ardour of a pursuing foe was checked and chastised by the same habits of irregular speed and sudden evolution.
 In the abuse of victory, they astonished Europe, yet smarting from the wounds of the <LOC>Saracen</LOC> and the Dane: mercy they rarely asked, and more rarely bestowed: both sexes were accused is equally inaccessible to pity, and their appetite for raw flesh might countenance the popular tale, that they drank the blood, and feasted on the hearts of the slain.
 Yet the <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> were not devoid of those principles of justice and humanity, which nature has implanted in every bosom.
 The license of public and private injuries was restrained by laws and punishments; and in the security of an open camp, theft is the most tempting and most dangerous offence.
 Among the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> there were many, whose spontaneous virtue supplied their laws and corrected their manners, who performed the duties, and sympathized with the affections, of social life.
 Establishment and inroads of the Hungarians, A.
D.
 889.
 After a long pilgrimage of flight or victory, the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> hordes approached the common limits of the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empires.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conquests and final settlements extended on either side of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> above Vienna, below Belgrade, and beyond the measure of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> province of Pannonia, or the modern kingdom of Hungary.
 (30) That ample and fertile land was loosely occupied by the Moravians, a <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> name and tribe, which were driven by the invaders into the compass of a narrow province.
 <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> had stretched a vague and nominal empire as far as the edge of Transylvania; but, after the failure of his legitimate line, the dukes of <GPE>Moravia</GPE> forgot their obedience and tribute to the monarchs of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> France.
 The bastard <PERSON>Arnulph</PERSON> was provoked to invite the arms of the Turks: they rushed through the real or figurative wall, which his indiscretion had thrown open; and the king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> has been justly reproached as a traitor to the civil and ecclesiastical society of the Christians.
 A.
D.
 900, etc.
 During the life of Arnulph, the <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> were checked by gratitude or fear; but in the infancy of his son <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> they discovered and invaded Bavaria; and such was their <NORP>Scythian</NORP> speed, that in a single day a circuit of fifty miles was stripped and consumed.
 In the battle of <GPE>Augsburgh</GPE> the <NORP>Christians</NORP> maintained their advantage till the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> hour of the day, they were deceived and vanquished by the flying stratagems of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> cavalry.
 The conflagration spread over the provinces of Bavaria, Swabia, and Franconia; and the <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> (31) promoted the reign of anarchy, by forcing the stoutest barons to discipline their vassals and fortify their castles.
 The origin of walled towns is ascribed to this calamitous period; nor could any distance be secure against an enemy, who, almost at the same instant, laid in ashes the <GPE>Helvetian</GPE> monastery of St.
 Gall, and the city of Bremen, on the shores of the northern ocean.
 Above thirty years the <NORP>Germanic</NORP> empire, or kingdom, was subject to the ignominy of tribute; and resistance was disarmed by the menace, the serious and effectual menace of dragging the women and children into captivity, and of slaughtering the males above the age of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years.
 I have neither power nor inclination to follow the <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> beyond the Rhine; but I must observe with surprise, that the southern provinces of <GPE>France</GPE> were blasted by the tempest, and that Spain, behind her Pyrenees, was astonished at the approach of these formidable strangers.
 (32) A.
D.
 900.
 The vicinity of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had tempted their early inroads; but from their camp on the Brenta, they beheld with some terror the apparent strength and populousness of the new discovered country.
 They requested leave to retire; their request was proudly rejected by the <NORP>Italian</NORP> king; and the lives of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Christians</NORP> paid the forfeit of his obstinacy and rashness.
 Among the cities of the West, the royal <PERSON>Pavia</PERSON> was conspicuous in fame and splendour; and the preeminence of <GPE>Rome</GPE> itself was only derived from the relics of the apostles.
 A.
D.
 924.
 The <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> appeared; <PERSON>Pavia</PERSON> was in flames; <CARDINAL>forty-three</CARDINAL> churches were consumed; and, after the massacre of the people, they spared about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> wretches who had gathered some bushels of gold and silver (a vague exaggeration) from the smoking ruins of their country.
 In these <DATE>annual</DATE> excursions from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to the neighbourhood of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Capua, the churches, that yet escaped, resounded with a fearful litany: "O, save and deliver us from the arrows of the Hungarians!" But the saints were deaf or inexorable; and the torrent rolled forwards, till it was stopped by the extreme land of Calabria.
 (33) A composition was offered and accepted for the head of each <NORP>Italian</NORP> subject; and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> bushels of silver were poured forth in the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> camp.
 But falsehood is the natural antagonist of violence; and the robbers were defrauded both in the numbers of the assessment and the standard of the metal.
 On the side of the East, the <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> were opposed in doubtful conflict by the equal arms of the Bulgarians, whose faith forbade an alliance with the Pagans, and whose situation formed the barrier of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 A.
D.
 924.
 The barrier was overturned; the emperor of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> beheld the waving banners of the Turks; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their boldest warriors presumed to strike a battle-axe into the golden gate.
 The arts and treasures of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> diverted the assault; but the <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> might boast, in their retreat, that they had imposed a tribute on the spirit of <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> and the majesty of the Caesars.
 (34) The remote and rapid operations of the same campaign appear to magnify the power and numbers of the Turks; but their courage is most deserving of praise, since a light troop of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horse would often attempt and execute the most daring inroads to the gates of <GPE>Thessalonica</GPE> and Constantinople.
 At this disastrous aera of the ninth and tenth centuries, <LOC>Europe</LOC> was afflicted by a triple scourge from the North, the East, and the South: the Norman, the Hungarian, and the Saracen, sometimes trod the same ground of desolation; and these savage foes might have been compared by <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> lions growling over the carcass of a mangled stag.
 (35) Victory of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Fowler, A.
D.
 934.
 The deliverance of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and <NORP>Christendom</NORP> was achieved by the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> princes, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Fowler and <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the Great, who, in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> memorable battles, forever broke the power of the Hungarians.
 (36) The valiant <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was roused from a bed of sickness by the invasion of his country; but his mind was vigorous and his prudence successful.
 They obeyed and conquered: and the historical picture of the castle of <GPE>Merseburgh</GPE> expressed the features, or at least the character, of Henry, who, in an age of ignorance, intrusted to the finer arts the perpetuity of his name.
 (37) At the end of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the children of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> who had fallen by his sword invaded the empire of his son; and their force is defined, in the lowest estimate, at <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand horse.
 They were invited by domestic faction; the gates of <GPE>Germany</GPE> were treacherously unlocked; and they spread, far beyond the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and the Meuse, into the heart of Flanders.
 of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the Great, A.
D.
 955.
 But the vigour and prudence of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> dispelled the conspiracy; the princes were made sensible that unless they were true to each other, their religion and country were irrecoverably lost; and the national powers were reviewed in the plains of Augsburgh.
 They marched and fought in <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> legions, according to the division of provinces and tribes; the first, second, and third, were composed of Bavarians; the fourth, of Franconians; the fifth, of Saxons, under the immediate command of the monarch; the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> consisted of Swabians; and the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> legion, of a thousand Bohemians, closed the rear of the host.
 The resources of discipline and valour were fortified by the arts of superstition, which, on this occasion, may deserve the epithets of generous and salutary.
 The soldiers were purified with a fast; the camp was blessed with the relics of saints and martyrs; and the <NORP>Christian</NORP> hero girded on his side the sword of Constantine, grasped the invincible spear of Charlemagne, and waved the banner of St.
 Maurice, the praefect of the <NORP>Thebaean</NORP> legion.
 But his firmest confidence was placed in the holy lance, (38) whose point was fashioned of the nails of the cross, and which his father had extorted from the king of Burgundy, by the threats of war, and the gift of a province.
 The <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> were expected in the front; they secretly passed the Lech, a river of <GPE>Bavaria</GPE> that falls into the Danube; turned the rear of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> army; plundered the baggage, and disordered the legion of <GPE>Bohemia</GPE> and Swabia.
 The battle was restored by the Franconians, whose duke, the valiant Conrad, was pierced with an arrow as he rested from his fatigues: the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> fought under the eyes of their king; and his victory surpassed, in merit and importance, the triumphs of the last <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years.
 The loss of the <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> was still greater in the flight than in the action; they were encompassed by the rivers of Bavaria; and their past cruelties excluded them from the hope of mercy.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> captive princes were hanged at Ratisbon, the multitude of prisoners was slain or mutilated, and the fugitives, who presumed to appear in the face of their country, were condemned to everlasting poverty and disgrace.
 (39) Yet the spirit of the nation was humbled, and the most accessible passes of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> were fortified with a ditch and rampart.

 Adversity suggested the counsels of moderation and peace: the robbers of the <LOC>West</LOC> acquiesced in a sedentary life; and the next generation was taught, by a discerning prince, that far more might be gained by multiplying and exchanging the produce of a fruitful soil.
 The native race, the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> or <NORP>Fennic</NORP> blood, was mingled with new colonies of <NORP>Scythian</NORP> or <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> origin; (40) many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of robust and industrious captives had been imported from all the countries of Europe; (41) and after the marriage of <PERSON>Geisa</PERSON> with a <NORP>Bavarian</NORP> princess, he bestowed honours and estates on the nobles of Germany.
 (42) The son of <PERSON>Geisa</PERSON> was invested with the regal title, and the house of <PERSON>Arpad</PERSON> reigned <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years in the kingdom of Hungary.
 But the freeborn <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were not dazzled by the lustre of the diadem, and the people asserted their indefeasible right of choosing, deposing, and punishing the hereditary servant of the state.

 The name of <PERSON>RUSSIANS</PERSON> (43) was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> divulged, in the ninth century, by an embassy of Theophilus, emperor of the East, to the emperor of the West, Lewis, the son of Charlemagne.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were accompanied by the envoys of the great duke, or chagan, or czar, of the Russians.
 A.
D.
 839.
 In their journey to Constantinople, they had traversed many hostile nations; and they hoped to escape the dangers of their return, by requesting the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch to transport them by sea to their native country.
 A closer examination detected their origin: they were the brethren of the <NORP>Swedes</NORP> and Normans, whose name was already odious and formidable in France; and it might justly be apprehended, that these <NORP>Russian</NORP> strangers were not the messengers of peace, but the emissaries of war.
 They were detained, while the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were dismissed; and <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> expected a more satisfactory account, that he might obey the laws of hospitality or prudence, according to the interest of both empires.
 (44) This <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> origin of the people, or at least the princes, of Russia, may be confirmed and illustrated by the national annals (45) and the general history of the North.
 The Normans, who had so long been concealed by a veil of impenetrable darkness, suddenly burst forth in the spirit of naval and military enterprise.
 The vast, and, as it is said, the populous regions of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, were crowded with independent chieftains and desperate adventurers, who sighed in the laziness of peace, and smiled in the agonies of death.
 Piracy was the exercise, the trade, the glory, and the virtue, of the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> youth.
 Impatient of a bleak climate and narrow limits, they started from the banquet, grasped their arms, sounded their horn, ascended their vessels, and explored every coast that promised either spoil or settlement.
 The <LOC>Baltic</LOC> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> scene of their naval achievements they visited the eastern shores, the silent residence of <NORP>Fennic</NORP> and <NORP>Sclavonic</NORP> tribes, and the primitive <NORP>Russians</NORP> of the Lake Ladoga paid a tribute, the skins of white squirrels, to these strangers, whom they saluted with the title of <NORP>Varangians</NORP> (46) or Corsairs.
 Their superiority in arms, discipline, and renown, commanded the fear and reverence of the natives.
 In their wars against the more inland savages, the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> condescended to serve as friends and auxiliaries, and gradually, by choice or conquest, obtained the dominion of a people whom they were qualified to protect.
 Their tyranny was expelled, their valour was again recalled, A.
D.
 862.
 till at length Ruric, a <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> chief, became the father of a dynasty which reigned above <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years.
 His brothers extended his influence: the example of service and usurpation was imitated by his companions in the southern provinces of Russia; and their establishments, by the usual methods of war and assassination, were cemented into the fabric of a powerful monarchy.
 The <NORP>Varangians</NORP> of Constantinople.
 As long as the descendants of <PERSON>Ruric</PERSON> were considered as aliens and conquerors, they ruled by the sword of the Varangians, distributed estates and subjects to their faithful captains, and supplied their numbers with fresh streams of adventurers from the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> coast.
 (47) But when the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> chiefs had struck a deep and permanent root into the soil, they mingled with the <NORP>Russians</NORP> in blood, religion, and language, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Waladimir</PERSON> had the merit of delivering his country from these foreign mercenaries.
 They had seated him on the throne; his riches were insufficient to satisfy their demands; but they listened to his pleasing advice, that they should seek, not a more grateful, but a more wealthy, master; that they should embark for Greece, where, instead of the skins of squirrels, silk and gold would be the recompense of their service.
 At the same time, the <NORP>Russian</NORP> prince admonished his <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> ally to disperse and employ, to recompense and restrain, these impetuous children of the North.
 Contemporary writers have recorded the introduction, name, and character, of the Varangians: each day they rose in confidence and esteem; the whole body was assembled at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to perform the duty of guards; and their strength was recruited by a numerous band of their countrymen from the Island of Thule.
 On this occasion, the vague appellation of <PRODUCT>Thule</PRODUCT> is applied to England; and the new <NORP>Varangians</NORP> were a colony of <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> and <NORP>Danes</NORP> who fled from the yoke of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conqueror.
 The habits of pilgrimage and piracy had approximated the countries of the earth; these exiles were entertained in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court; and they preserved, till the last age of the empire, the inheritance of spotless loyalty, and the use of the <NORP>Danish</NORP> or <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> tongue.
 With their broad and double-edged battle-axes on their shoulders, they attended the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor to the temple, the senate, and the hippodrome; he slept and feasted under their trusty guard; and the keys of the palace, the treasury, and the capital, were held by the firm and faithful hands of the Varangians.
 (48) Geography and trade of Russia, A.
D.
 950.
 In the tenth century, the geography of <GPE>Scythia</GPE> was extended far beyond the limits of ancient knowledge; and the monarchy of the <NORP>Russians</NORP> obtains a vast and conspicuous place in the map of Constantine.
 (49) The sons of <PERSON>Ruric</PERSON> were masters of the spacious province of Wolodomir, or Moscow; and, if they were confined on that side by the hordes of the East, their western frontier in those early days was enlarged to the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> Sea and the country of the Prussians.
 Their northern reign ascended above the sixtieth degree of latitude over the <NORP>Hyperborean</NORP> regions, which fancy had peopled with monsters, or clouded with eternal darkness.
 To the south they followed the course of the Borysthenes, and approached with that river the neighbourhood of the <NORP>Euxine</NORP> Sea.
 The tribes that dwelt, or wandered, in this ample circuit were obedient to the same conqueror, and insensibly blended into the same nation.
 The language of <GPE>Russia</GPE> is a dialect of the Sclavonian; but in the tenth century, these <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> modes of speech were different from each other; and, as the <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> prevailed in the South, it may be presumed that the original <NORP>Russians</NORP> of the North, the primitive subjects of the <NORP>Varangian</NORP> chief, were a portion of the <NORP>Fennic</NORP> race.
 With the emigration, union, or dissolution, of the wandering tribes, the loose and indefinite picture of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> desert has continually shifted.
 But the most ancient map of <GPE>Russia</GPE> affords some places which still retain their name and position; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> capitals, <PERSON>Novogorod</PERSON> (50) and Kiow, (51) are coeval with the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age of the monarchy.
 <PERSON>Novogorod</PERSON> had not yet deserved the epithet of great, nor the alliance of the Hanseatic League, which diffused the streams of opulence and the principles of freedom.
 <GPE>Kiow</GPE> could not yet boast of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> churches, an innumerable people, and a degree of greatness and splendour which was compared with <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by those who had never seen the residence of the Caesars.
 In their origin, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> cities were no more than camps or fairs, the most convenient stations in which the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> might assemble for the occasional business of war or trade.
 Yet even these assemblies announce some progress in the arts of society; a new breed of cattle was imported from the southern provinces; and the spirit of commercial enterprise pervaded the sea and land, from the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> to the Euxine, from the mouth of the <FAC>Oder</FAC> to the port of Constantinople.
 In the days of idolatry and barbarism, the <NORP>Sclavonic</NORP> city of <GPE>Julin</GPE> was frequented and enriched by the Normans, who had prudently secured a free mart of purchase and exchange.
 (52) From this harbour, at the entrance of the Oder, the corsair, or merchant, sailed in <CARDINAL>forty-three</CARDINAL> days to the eastern shores of the Baltic, the most distant nations were intermingled, and the holy groves of <GPE>Curland</GPE> are said to have been decorated with <NORP>Grecian</NORP> and <NORP>Spanish</NORP> gold.
 (53) Between the sea and <PERSON>Novogorod</PERSON> an easy intercourse was discovered; in the summer, through a gulf, a lake, and a navigable river; in the <DATE>winter</DATE> season, over the hard and level surface of boundless snows.
 From the neighbourhood of that city, the <NORP>Russians</NORP> descended the streams that fall into the Borysthenes; their canoes, of a single tree, were laden with slaves of every age, furs of every species, the spoil of their beehives, and the hides of their cattle; and the whole produce of the <LOC>North</LOC> was collected and discharged in the magazines of Kiow.
 The month of June was the ordinary season of the departure of the fleet: the timber of the canoes was framed into the oars and benches of more solid and capacious boats; and they proceeded without obstacle down the Borysthenes, as far as the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> ridges of rocks, which traverse the bed, and precipitate the waters, of the river.
 At the more shallow falls it was sufficient to lighten the vessels; but the deeper cataracts were impassable; and the mariners, who dragged their vessels and their slaves six miles over land, were exposed in this toilsome journey to the robbers of the desert.
 (54) At the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> island below the falls, the <NORP>Russians</NORP> celebrated the festival of their escape: at a second, near the mouth of the river, they repaired their shattered vessels for the longer and more perilous voyage of the Black Sea.
 If they steered along the coast, the <LOC>Danube</LOC> was accessible; with a fair wind they could reach in <DATE>thirty-six</DATE> or <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> hours the opposite shores of Anatolia; and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> admitted the <DATE>annual</DATE> visit of the strangers of the North.
 They returned at the stated season with a rich cargo of corn, wine, and oil, the manufactures of Greece, and the spices of India.
 Some of their countrymen resided in the capital and provinces; and the national treaties protected the persons, effects, and privileges, of the <NORP>Russian</NORP> merchant.
 (55) Naval expeditions of the <NORP>Russians</NORP> against Constantinople.
 But the same communication which had been opened for the benefit, was soon abused for the injury, of mankind.
 In a period of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and ninety years, the <NORP>Russians</NORP> made <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> attempts to plunder the treasures of Constantinople: the event was various, but the motive, the means, and the object, were the same in these naval expeditions.
 (56) The <NORP>Russian</NORP> traders had seen the magnificence, and tasted the luxury of the city of the Caesars.
 A marvellous tale, and a scanty supply, excited the desires of their savage countrymen: they envied the gifts of nature which their climate denied; they coveted the works of art, which they were too lazy to imitate and too indigent to purchase; the <NORP>Varangian</NORP> princes unfurled the banners of piratical adventure, and their bravest soldiers were drawn from the nations that dwelt in the northern isles of the ocean.
 (57) The image of their naval armaments was revived in the last century, in the fleets of the Cossacks, which issued from the Borysthenes, to navigate the same seas for a similar purpose.
 (58) The <NORP>Greek</NORP> appellation of monoxyla, or single canoes, might justly be applied to the bottom of their vessels.
 It was scooped out of the long stem of a beech or willow, but the slight and narrow foundation was raised and continued on either side with planks, till it attained the length of sixty, and the height of about twelve, feet.
 These boats were built without a deck, but with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rudders and a mast; to move with sails and oars; and to contain from <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> to seventy men, with their arms, and provisions of fresh water and salt fish.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> trial of the <NORP>Russians</NORP> was made with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> boats; but when the national force was exerted, they might arm against <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> a thousand or <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> vessels.
 Their fleet was not much inferior to the royal navy of Agamemnon, but it was magnified in the eyes of fear to <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> or fifteen times the real proportion of its strength and numbers.
 Had the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors been endowed with foresight to discern, and vigour to prevent, perhaps they might have sealed with a maritime force the mouth of the Borysthenes.
 Their indolence abandoned the coast of <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> to the calamities of a piratical war, which, after an interval of six <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, again infested the Euxine; but as long as the capital was respected, the sufferings of a distant province escaped the notice both of the prince and the historian.
 The storm which had swept along from the <LOC>Phasis</LOC> and Trebizond, at length burst on the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> of Thrace; a strait of fifteen miles, in which the rude vessels of the <NORP>Russians</NORP> might have been stopped and destroyed by a more skilful adversary.
 The first, A.
D.
 865.
 In their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> enterprise (59) under the princes of Kiow, they passed without opposition, and occupied the port of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> in the absence of the emperor Michael, the son of Theophilus.
 Through a crowd of perils, he landed at the palace-stairs, and immediately repaired to a church of the Virgin Mary.
 (60) By the advice of the patriarch, her garment, a precious relic, was drawn from the sanctuary and dipped in the sea; and a seasonable tempest, which determined the retreat of the Russians, was devoutly ascribed to the mother of God.
 (61) The second, A.
D.
 904.
 The silence of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> may inspire some doubt of the truth, or at least of the importance, of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attempt by Oleg, the guardian of the sons of Ruric.
 (62) A strong barrier of arms and fortifications defended the Bosphorus: they were eluded by the usual expedient of drawing the boats over the isthmus; and this simple operation is described in the national chronicles, as if the <NORP>Russian</NORP> fleet had sailed over dry land with a brisk and favourable gale.
 The third, A.
D.
 941.
 The leader of the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> armament, Igor, the son of Ruric, had chosen a moment of weakness and decay, when the naval powers of the empire were employed against the Saracens.
 But if courage be not wanting, the instruments of defence are seldom deficient.
 <CARDINAL>Fifteen</CARDINAL> broken and decayed galleys were boldly launched against the enemy; but instead of the single tube of <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire usually planted on the prow, the sides and stern of each vessel were abundantly supplied with that liquid combustible.
 The engineers were dexterous; the weather was propitious; many thousand Russians, who chose rather to be drowned than burnt, leaped into the sea; and those who escaped to the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> shore were inhumanly slaughtered by the peasants and soldiers.
 The fourth, A.
D.
 1043.
 Yet <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the canoes escaped into shallow water; and the next spring <PERSON>Igor</PERSON> was again prepared to retrieve his disgrace and claim his revenge.
 (63) After a long peace, Jaroslaus, the great grandson of Igor, resumed the same project of a naval invasion.
 A fleet, under the command of his son, was repulsed at the entrance of the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> by the same artificial flames.
 But in the rashness of pursuit, the vanguard of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was encompassed by an irresistible multitude of boats and men; their provision of fire was probably exhausted; and twenty- <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> galleys were either taken, sunk, or destroyed.
 (64) Negotiations and prophecy.
 Yet the threats or calamities of a <NORP>Russian</NORP> war were more frequently diverted by treaty than by arms.
 In these naval hostilities, every disadvantage was on the side of the Greeks; their savage enemy afforded no mercy: his poverty promised no spoil; his impenetrable retreat deprived the conqueror of the hopes of revenge; and the pride or weakness of empire indulged an opinion, that no honour could be gained or lost in the intercourse with Barbarians.
 At <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> their demands were high and inadmissible, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of gold for each soldier or mariner of the fleet: the <NORP>Russian</NORP> youth adhered to the design of conquest and glory; but the counsels of moderation were recommended by the hoary sages.
 The memory of these <LOC>Arctic</LOC> fleets that seemed to descend from the polar circle left deep impression of terror on the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 By the vulgar of every rank, it was asserted and believed, that an equestrian statue in the square of <LOC>Taurus</LOC> was secretly inscribed with a prophecy, how the Russians, in the last days, should become masters of Constantinople.
 (66) In our own time, a <NORP>Russian</NORP> armament, instead of sailing from the Borysthenes, has circumnavigated the continent of Europe; and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> capital has been threatened by a squadron of strong and lofty ships of war, each of which, with its naval science and thundering artillery, could have sunk or scattered a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> canoes, such as those of their ancestors.
 Perhaps the present generation may yet behold the accomplishment of the prediction, of a rare prediction, of which the style is unambiguous and the date unquestionable.
 Reign of Swatoslaus, A.
D.
 955-973.
 By land the <NORP>Russians</NORP> were less formidable than by sea; and as they fought for the most part on foot, their irregular legions must often have been broken and overthrown by the cavalry of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> hordes.
 Yet their growing towns, however slight and imperfect, presented a shelter to the subject, and a barrier to the enemy: the monarchy of Kiow, till a fatal partition, assumed the dominion of the North; and the nations from the <LOC>Volga</LOC> to the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were subdued or repelled by the arms of Swatoslaus, (67) the son of Igor, the son of Oleg, the son of Ruric.
 The vigour of his mind and body was fortified by the hardships of a military and savage life.
 Wrapped in a bear-skin, <PERSON>Swatoslaus</PERSON> usually slept on the ground, his head reclining on a saddle; his diet was coarse and frugal, and, like the heroes of Homer, (68) his meat (it was often horse-flesh) was broiled or roasted on the coals.
 The exercise of war gave stability and discipline to his army; and it may be presumed, that no soldier was permitted to transcend the luxury of his chief.
 By an embassy from Nicephorus, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor, he was moved to undertake the conquest of Bulgaria; and a gift of fifteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds of gold was laid at his feet to defray the expense, or reward the toils, of the expedition.
 An army of <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> thousand men was assembled and embarked; they sailed from the <NORP>Borysthenes</NORP> to the Danube; their landing was effected on the Maesian shore; and, after a sharp encounter, the swords of the <NORP>Russians</NORP> prevailed against the arrows of the <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> horse.
 The vanquished king sunk into the grave; his children were made captive; and his dominions, as far as Mount Haemus, were subdued or ravaged by the northern invaders.
 But instead of relinquishing his prey, and performing his engagements, the <NORP>Varangian</NORP> prince was more disposed to advance than to retire; and, had his ambition been crowned with success, the seat of empire in that early period might have been transferred to a more temperate and fruitful climate.
 <PERSON>Swatoslaus</PERSON> enjoyed and acknowledged the advantages of his new position, in which he could unite, by exchange or rapine, the various productions of the earth.
 By an easy navigation he might draw from <GPE>Russia</GPE> the native commodities of furs, wax, and hydromed: <GPE>Hungary</GPE> supplied him with a breed of horses and the spoils of the West; and <GPE>Greece</GPE> abounded with gold, silver, and the foreign luxuries, which his poverty had affected to disdain.
 The bands of Patzinacites, Chozars, and Turks, repaired to the standard of victory; and the ambassador of <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> betrayed his trust, assumed the purple, and promised to share with his new allies the treasures of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> world.
 From the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> the <NORP>Russian</NORP> prince pursued his march as far as Adrianople; a formal summons to evacuate the <NORP>Roman</NORP> province was dismissed with contempt; and <PERSON>Swatoslaus</PERSON> fiercely replied, that <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> might soon expect the presence of an enemy and a master.
 His defeat by John Zimisces, A.
D.
 970-973.
 <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> could no longer expel the mischief which he had introduced; but his throne and wife were inherited by John Zimisces, (69) who, in a diminutive body, possessed the spirit and abilities of a hero.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> victory of his lieutenants deprived the <NORP>Russians</NORP> of their foreign allies, <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand of whom were either destroyed by the sword, or provoked to revolt, or tempted to desert.
 Thrace was delivered, but seventy thousand <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were still in arms; and the legions that had been recalled from the new conquests of Syria, prepared, with the return of the spring, to march under the banners of a warlike prince, who declared himself the friend and avenger of the injured Bulgaria.
 The passes of Mount Haemus had been left unguarded; they were instantly occupied; the <NORP>Roman</NORP> vanguard was formed of the immortals, (a proud imitation of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> style;) the emperor led the main body of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> foot; and the rest of his forces followed in slow and cautious array, with the baggage and military engines.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit of <PERSON>Zimisces</PERSON> was the reduction of Marcianopolis, or Peristhlaba, (70) in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days; the trumpets sounded; the walls were scaled; <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <NORP>Russians</NORP> were put to the sword; and the sons of the <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> king were rescued from an ignominious prison, and invested with a nominal diadem.
 After these repeated losses, <PERSON>Swatoslaus</PERSON> retired to the strong post of Drista, on the banks of the Danube, and was pursued by an enemy who alternately employed the arms of celerity and delay.
 The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> galleys ascended the river, the legions completed a line of circumvallation; and the <NORP>Russian</NORP> prince was encompassed, assaulted, and famished, in the fortifications of the camp and city.
 Many deeds of valour were performed; several desperate sallies were attempted; nor was it till after a siege of sixty-five days that <PERSON>Swatoslaus</PERSON> yielded to his adverse fortune.
 The liberal terms which he obtained announce the prudence of the victor, who respected the valour, and apprehended the despair, of an unconquered mind.
 The great duke of <GPE>Russia</GPE> bound himself, by solemn imprecations, to relinquish all hostile designs; a safe passage was opened for his return; the liberty of trade and navigation was restored; a measure of corn was distributed to each of his soldiers; and the allowance of <CARDINAL>twenty-two</CARDINAL> thousand measures attests the loss and the remnant of the Barbarians.
 After a painful voyage, they again reached the mouth of the Borysthenes; but their provisions were exhausted; the season was unfavourable; they passed the <DATE>winter</DATE> on the ice; and, before they could prosecute their march, <PERSON>Swatoslaus</PERSON> was surprised and oppressed by the neighbouring tribes with whom the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> entertained a perpetual and useful correspondence.
 (71) Far different was the return of Zimisces, who was received in his capital like <PERSON>Camillus</PERSON> or Marius, the saviours of ancient Rome.
 But the merit of the victory was attributed by the pious emperor to the mother of God; and the image of the Virgin Mary, with the divine infant in her arms, was placed on a triumphal car, adorned with the spoils of war, and the ensigns of <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> royalty.
 <PERSON>Zimisces</PERSON> made his public entry on horseback; the diadem on his head, a crown of laurel in his hand; and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was astonished to applaud the martial virtues of her sovereign.
 (72) Conversion of Russia, A.
D.
 864.
 <PERSON>Photius</PERSON> of Constantinople, a patriarch, whose ambition was equal to his curiosity, congratulates himself and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church on the conversion of the Russians.
 (73) Those fierce and bloody <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> had been persuaded, by the voice of reason and religion, to acknowledge <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> for their God, the <NORP>Christian</NORP> missionaries for their teachers, and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> for their friends and brethren.
 His triumph was transient and premature.
 In the various fortune of their piratical adventures, some <NORP>Russian</NORP> chiefs might allow themselves to be sprinkled with the waters of baptism; and a <NORP>Greek</NORP> bishop, with the name of metropolitan, might administer the sacraments in the church of Kiow, to a congregation of slaves and natives.
 But the seed of the gospel was sown on a barren soil: many were the apostates, the converts were few; and the baptism of <PERSON>Olga</PERSON> may be fixed as the aera of <NORP>Russian</NORP> Christianity.
 (74) A female, perhaps of the basest origin, who could revenge the death, and assume the sceptre, of her husband Igor, must have been endowed with those active virtues which command the fear and obedience of Barbarians.
 In a moment of foreign and domestic peace, she sailed from <GPE>Kiow</GPE> to Constantinople; and the emperor <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> Porphyrogenitus has described, with minute diligence, the ceremonial of her reception in his capital and palace.
 The steps, the titles, the salutations, the banquet, the presents, were exquisitely adjusted to gratify the vanity of the stranger, with due reverence to the superior majesty of the purple.
 (75) Baptism of Olga, A.
D.
 955.
 In the sacrament of baptism, she received the venerable name of the empress Helena; and her conversion might be preceded or followed by her uncle, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> interpreters, <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> damsels of a higher, and <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of a lower rank, <CARDINAL>twenty-two</CARDINAL> domestics or ministers, and <CARDINAL>forty-four</CARDINAL> <NORP>Russian</NORP> merchants, who composed the retinue of the great princess Olga.
 After her return to <GPE>Kiow</GPE> and Novogorod, she firmly persisted in her new religion; but her labours in the propagation of the gospel were not crowned with success; and both her family and nation adhered with obstinacy or indifference to the gods of their fathers.
 Her son <PERSON>Swatoslaus</PERSON> was apprehensive of the scorn and ridicule of his companions; and her grandson <GPE>Wolodomir</GPE> devoted his youthful zeal to multiply and decorate the monuments of ancient worship.
 The savage deities of the <LOC>North</LOC> were still propitiated with human sacrifices: in the choice of the victim, a citizen was preferred to a stranger, a <NORP>Christian</NORP> to an idolater; and the father, who defended his son from the sacerdotal knife, was involved in the same doom by the rage of a fanatic tumult.
 Yet the lessons and example of the pious <PERSON>Olga</PERSON> had made a deep, though secret, impression in the minds of the prince and people: the <NORP>Greek</NORP> missionaries continued to preach, to dispute, and to baptize: and the ambassadors or merchants of <GPE>Russia</GPE> compared the idolatry of the woods with the elegant superstition of Constantinople.
 They had gazed with admiration on the dome of St.
 Sophia: the lively pictures of saints and martyrs, the riches of the altar, the number and vestments of the priests, the pomp and order of the ceremonies; they were edified by the alternate succession of devout silence and harmonious song; nor was it difficult to persuade them, that a choir of angels descended each day from heaven to join in the devotion of the Christians.
 (76) of Wolodomir, A.
D.

 But the conversion of <GPE>Wolodomir</GPE> was determined, or hastened, by his desire of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride.
 At the same time, and in the city of Cherson, the rites of baptism and marriage were celebrated by the <NORP>Christian</NORP> pontiff: the city he restored to the emperor Basil, the brother of his spouse; but the brazen gates were transported, as it is said, to Novogorod, and erected before the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> church as a trophy of his victory and faith.
 (77) At his despotic command, Peround, the god of thunder, whom he had so long adored, was dragged through the streets of Kiow; and <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> sturdy <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> battered with clubs the misshapen image, which was indignantly cast into the waters of the Borysthenes.
 The edict of <GPE>Wolodomir</GPE> had proclaimed, that all who should refuse the rites of baptism would be treated as the enemies of God and their prince; and the rivers were instantly filled with many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of obedient Russians, who acquiesced in the truth and excellence of a doctrine which had been embraced by the great duke and his boyars.
 In the next generation, the relics of <NORP>Paganism</NORP> were finally extirpated; but as the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers of <GPE>Wolodomir</GPE> had died without baptism, their bones were taken from the grave, and sanctified by an irregular and posthumous sacrament.

 800-1100.
 In the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aera, the reign of the gospel and of the church was extended over Bulgaria, Hungary, Bohemia, Saxony, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, and Russia.
 (78) The triumphs of apostolic zeal were repeated in the iron age of Christianity; and the northern and eastern regions of <LOC>Europe</LOC> submitted to a religion, more different in theory than in practice, from the worship of their native idols.
 A laudable ambition excited the monks both of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Greece, to visit the tents and huts of the Barbarians: poverty, hardships, and dangers, were the lot of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> missionaries; their courage was active and patient; their motive pure and meritorious; their present reward consisted in the testimony of their conscience and the respect of a grateful people; but the fruitful harvest of their toils was inherited and enjoyed by the proud and wealthy prelates of succeeding times.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conversions were free and spontaneous: a holy life and an eloquent tongue were the only arms of the missionaries; but the domestic fables of the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> were silenced by the miracles and visions of the strangers; and the favourable temper of the chiefs was accelerated by the dictates of vanity and interest.
 The leaders of nations, who were saluted with the titles of kings and saints, (79) held it lawful and pious to impose the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> faith on their subjects and neighbours; the coast of the Baltic, from <GPE>Holstein</GPE> to the <LOC>Gulf</LOC> of Finland, was invaded under the standard of the cross; and the reign of idolatry was closed by the conversion of <GPE>Lithuania</GPE> in the fourteenth century.
 Yet truth and candour must acknowledge, that the conversion of the <LOC>North</LOC> imparted many temporal benefits both to the old and the new Christians.
 The rage of war, inherent to the human species, could not be healed by the evangelic precepts of charity and peace; and the ambition of <NORP>Catholic</NORP> princes has renewed in every age the calamities of hostile contention.
 But the admission of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> into the pale of civil and ecclesiastical society delivered <LOC>Europe</LOC> from the depredations, by sea and land, of the Normans, the Hungarians, and the Russians, who learned to spare their brethren and cultivate their possessions.
 (80) The establishment of law and order was promoted by the influence of the clergy; and the rudiments of art and science were introduced into the savage countries of the globe.
 The liberal piety of the <NORP>Russian</NORP> princes engaged in their service the most skilful of the Greeks, to decorate the cities and instruct the inhabitants: the dome and the paintings of St.
 Sophia were rudely copied in the churches of <GPE>Kiow</GPE> and Novogorod: the writings of the fathers were translated into the <NORP>Sclavonic</NORP> idiom; and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> noble youths were invited or compelled to attend the lessons of the college of Jaroslaus.
 It should appear that <GPE>Russia</GPE> might have derived an early and rapid improvement from her peculiar connection with the church and state of Constantinople, which at that age so justly despised the ignorance of the Latins.
 But the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> nation was servile, solitary, and verging to a hasty decline: after the fall of Kiow, the navigation of the <NORP>Borysthenes</NORP> was forgotten; the great princes of <GPE>Wolodomir</GPE> and <GPE>Moscow</GPE> were separated from the sea and Christendom; and the divided monarchy was oppressed by the ignominy and blindness of <NORP>Tartar</NORP> servitude.
 (81) The <NORP>Sclavonic</NORP> and <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> kingdoms, which had been converted by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> missionaries, were exposed, it is true, to the spiritual jurisdiction and temporal claims of the popes; (82) but they were united in language and religious worship, with each other, and with Rome; they imbibed the free and generous spirit of the <NORP>European</NORP> republic, and gradually shared the light of knowledge which arose on the western world.
