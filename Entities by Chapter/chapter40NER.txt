 The emperor <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was born (1) near the ruins of Sardica, (the modern Sophia,) of an obscure race (2) of Barbarians, (3) the inhabitants of a wild and desolate country, to which the names of Dardania, of Dacia, and of Bulgaria, have been successively applied.
 His elevation was prepared by the adventurous spirit of his uncle Justin, who, with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> other peasants of the same village, deserted, for the profession of arms, the more useful employment of husbandmen or shepherds.
 (4) On foot, with a scanty provision of biscuit in their knapsacks, the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> youths followed the high road of Constantinople, and were soon enrolled, for their strength and stature, among the guards of the emperor Leo.
 Under the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> succeeding reigns, the fortunate peasant emerged to wealth and honours; and his escape from some dangers which threatened his life was afterwards ascribed to the guardian angel who watches over the fate of kings.
 His long and laudable service in the <NORP>Isaurian</NORP> and <NORP>Persian</NORP> wars would not have preserved from oblivion the name of Justin; yet they might warrant the military promotion, which in the course of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years he gradually obtained; the rank of tribune, of count, and of general; the dignity of senator, and the command of the guards, who obeyed him as their chief, at the important crisis when the emperor <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> was removed from the world.
 The powerful kinsmen whom he had raised and enriched were excluded from the throne; and the eunuch Amantius, who reigned in the palace, had secretly resolved to fix the diadem on the head of the most obsequious of his creatures.
 A liberal donative, to conciliate the suffrage of the guards, was intrusted for that purpose in the hands of their commander.

 But these weighty arguments were treacherously employed by <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> in his own favor; and as no competitor presumed to appear, the <NORP>Dacian</NORP> peasant was invested with the purple by the unanimous consent of the soldiers, who knew him to be brave and gentle, of the clergy and people, who believed him to be orthodox, and of the provincials, who yielded a blind and implicit submission to the will of the capital.
 The elder Justin, as he is distinguished from another emperor of the same family and name, ascended the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne at the age of sixty-eight years; and, had he been left to his own guidance, every moment of a <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> years' reign must have exposed to his subjects the impropriety of their choice.
 His ignorance was similar to that of Theodoric; and it is remarkable that in an age not destitute of learning, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> contemporary monarchs had never been instructed in the knowledge of the alphabet.
 But the genius of <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> was far inferior to that of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king: the experience of a soldier had not qualified him for the government of an empire; and though personally brave, the consciousness of his own weakness was naturally attended with doubt, distrust, and political apprehension.
 But the official business of the state was diligently and faithfully transacted by the quaestor Proclus; (5) and the aged emperor adopted the talents and ambition of his nephew Justinian, an aspiring youth, whom his uncle had drawn from the rustic solitude of Dacia, and educated at Constantinople, as the heir of his private fortune, and at length of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.

 520-527.
 Since the eunuch <PERSON>Amantius</PERSON> had been defrauded of his money, it became necessary to deprive him of his life.
 The task was easily accomplished by the charge of a real or fictitious conspiracy; and the judges were informed, as an accumulation of guilt, that he was secretly addicted to the <NORP>Manichaean</NORP> heresy.
 (6) <PERSON>Amantius</PERSON> lost his head; <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> of his companions, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> domestics of the palace, were punished either with death or exile; and their unfortunate candidate for the purple was cast into a deep dungeon, overwhelmed with stones, and ignominiously thrown, without burial, into the sea.
 The ruin of <NORP>Vitalian</NORP> was a work of more difficulty and danger.
 That <NORP>Gothic</NORP> chief had rendered himself popular by the civil war which he boldly waged against <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> for the defence of the orthodox faith, and after the conclusion of an advantageous treaty, he still remained in the neighborhood of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> at the head of a formidable and victorious army of Barbarians.
 By the frail security of oaths, he was tempted to relinquish this advantageous situation, and to trust his person within the walls of a city, whose inhabitants, particularly the blue faction, were artfully incensed against him by the remembrance even of his pious hostilities.
 The emperor and his nephew embraced him as the faithful and worthy champion of the church and state; and gratefully adorned their favorite with the titles of consul and general; but in the seventh month of his consulship, <NORP>Vitalian</NORP> was stabbed with <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> wounds at the royal banquet; (7) and Justinian, who inherited the spoil, was accused as the assassin of a spiritual brother, to whom he had recently pledged his faith in the participation of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> mysteries.
 (8) After the fall of his rival, he was promoted, without any claim of military service, to the office of master-general of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> armies, whom it was his duty to lead into the field against the public enemy.
 But, in the pursuit of fame, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> might have lost his present dominion over the age and weakness of his uncle; and instead of acquiring by <NORP>Scythian</NORP> or <NORP>Persian</NORP> trophies the applause of his countrymen, (9) the prudent warrior solicited their favor in the churches, the circus, and the senate, of Constantinople.
 The <NORP>Catholics</NORP> were attached to the nephew of Justin, who, between the <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> and <NORP>Eutychian</NORP> heresies, trod the narrow path of inflexible and intolerant orthodoxy.
 (10) In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the new reign, he prompted and gratified the popular enthusiasm against the memory of the deceased emperor.
 After a schism of thirty-four years, he reconciled the proud and angry spirit of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, and spread among the <NORP>Latins</NORP> a favorable report of his pious respect for the apostolic see.
 The thrones of the <LOC>East</LOC> were filled with <NORP>Catholic</NORP> bishops, devoted to his interest, the clergy and the monks were gained by his liberality, and the people were taught to pray for their future sovereign, the hope and pillar of the true religion.
 The magnificence of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was displayed in the superior pomp of his public spectacles, an object not less sacred and important in the eyes of the multitude than the creed of Nice or Chalcedon: the expense of his consulship was esteemed at <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> lions, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> leopards, were produced at the same time in the amphitheatre, and a numerous train of horses, with their rich trappings, was bestowed as an extraordinary gift on the victorious charioteers of the circus.
 While he indulged the people of Constantinople, and received the addresses of foreign kings, the nephew of <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> assiduously cultivated the friendship of the senate.
 That venerable name seemed to qualify its members to declare the sense of the nation, and to regulate the succession of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> throne: the feeble <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> had permitted the vigor of government to degenerate into the form or substance of an aristocracy; and the military officers who had obtained the senatorial rank were followed by their domestic guards, a band of veterans, whose arms or acclamations might fix in a tumultuous moment the diadem of the East.
 The treasures of the state were lavished to procure the voices of the senators, and their unanimous wish, that he would be pleased to adopt <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> for his colleague, was communicated to the emperor.
 But this request, which too clearly admonished him of his approaching end, was unwelcome to the jealous temper of an aged monarch, desirous to retain the power which he was incapable of exercising; and Justin, holding his purple with both his hands, advised them to prefer, since an election was so profitable, some older candidate.
 Not withstanding this reproach, the senate proceeded to decorate <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> with the royal epithet of nobilissimus; and their decree was ratified by the affection or the fears of his uncle.
 After some time the languor of mind and body, to which he was reduced by an incurable wound in his thigh, indispensably required the aid of a guardian.
 He summoned the patriarch and senators; and in their presence solemnly placed the diadem on the head of his nephew, who was conducted from the palace to the circus, and saluted by the loud and joyful applause of the people.
 The life of <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> was prolonged about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> months; but from the instant of this ceremony, he was considered as dead to the empire, which acknowledged Justinian, in the forty-fifth year of his age, for the lawful sovereign of the East.
 (11) The reign of Justinian, A.

 565, Nov.
 14.
 From his elevation to his death, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> governed the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire thirty-eight years, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months, and <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> days.
 The events of his reign, which excite our curious attention by their number, variety, and importance, are diligently related by the secretary of Belisarius, a rhetorician, whom eloquence had promoted to the rank of senator and praefect of Constantinople.
 According to the vicissitudes of courage or servitude, of favor or disgrace, Character and histories of Procopius.
 <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (12) successively composed the history, the panegyric, and the satire of his own times.
 The <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> books of the Persian, Vandalic, and <NORP>Gothic</NORP> wars, (13) which are continued in the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> books of Agathias, deserve our esteem as a laborious and successful imitation of the Attic, or at least of the Asiatic, writers of ancient Greece.
 His facts are collected from the personal experience and free conversation of a soldier, a statesman, and a traveller; his style continually aspires, and often attains, to the merit of strength and elegance; his reflections, more especially in the speeches, which he too frequently inserts, contain a rich fund of political knowledge; and the historian, excited by the generous ambition of pleasing and instructing posterity, appears to disdain the prejudices of the people, and the flattery of courts.
 The writings of <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (14) were read and applauded by his contemporaries: (15) but, although he respectfully laid them at the foot of the throne, the pride of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> must have been wounded by the praise of a hero, who perpetually eclipses the glory of his inactive sovereign.
 The conscious dignity of independence was subdued by the hopes and fears of a slave; and the secretary of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> labored for pardon and reward in the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> books of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> edifices.
 He had dexterously chosen a subject of apparent splendour, in which he could loudly celebrate the genius, the magnificence, and the piety of a prince, who, both as a conqueror and legislator, had surpassed the puerile virtues of <PERSON>Themistocles</PERSON> and Cyrus.
 (16) Disappointment might urge the flatterer to secret revenge; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> glance of favor might again tempt him to suspend and suppress a libel, (17) in which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> <PERSON>Cyrus</PERSON> is degraded into an odious and contemptible tyrant, in which both the emperor and his consort <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> are seriously represented as <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> daemons, who had assumed a human form for the destruction of mankind.
 (18) Such base inconsistency must doubtless sully the reputation, and detract from the credit, of Procopius: yet, after the venom of his malignity has been suffered to exhale, the residue of the anecdotes, even the most disgraceful facts, some of which had been tenderly hinted in his public history, are established by their internal evidence, or the authentic monuments of the times.
 (19) From these various materials, I shall now proceed to describe the reign of Justinian, which will deserve and occupy an ample space.
 The present chapter will explain the elevation and character of Theodora, the factions of the circus, and the peaceful administration of the sovereign of the East.
 Division of the reign of Justinian.
 In the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> succeeding chapters, I shall relate the wars of Justinian, which achieved the conquest of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Italy; and I shall follow the victories of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> and Narses, without disguising the vanity of their triumphs, or the hostile virtue of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> and <NORP>Gothic</NORP> heroes.
 The series of this and the following volume will embrace the jurisprudence and theology of the emperor; the controversies and sects which still divide the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> church; the reformation of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> law which is obeyed or respected by the nations of modern Europe.
 Birth and vices of the empress Theodora.
 I.
 In the exercise of supreme power, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was to divide it with the woman whom he loved, the famous Theodora, (20) whose strange elevation cannot be applauded as the triumph of female virtue.
 Under the reign of Anastasius, the care of the wild beasts maintained by the green faction at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was intrusted to Acacius, a native of the Isle of Cyprus, who, from his employment, was surnamed the master of the bears.
 This honorable office was given after his death to another candidate, notwithstanding the diligence of his widow, who had already provided a husband and a successor.
 <PERSON>Acacius</PERSON> had left <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> daughters, Comito, (21) Theodora, and Anastasia, the eldest of whom did not then exceed the age of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years.
 On a solemn festival, these helpless orphans were sent by their distressed and indignant mother, in the garb of suppliants, into the midst of the theatre: the green faction received them with contempt, the blues with compassion; and this difference, which sunk deep into the mind of Theodora, was felt long afterwards in the administration of the empire.
 As they improved in age and beauty, the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sisters were successively devoted to the public and private pleasures of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> people: and Theodora, after following <PERSON>Comito</PERSON> on the stage, in the dress of a slave, with a stool on her head, was at length permitted to exercise her independent talents.
 She neither danced, nor sung, nor played on the flute; her skill was confined to the pantomime arts; she excelled in buffoon characters, and as often as the comedian swelled her cheeks, and complained with a ridiculous tone and gesture of the blows that were inflicted, the whole theatre of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> resounded with laughter and applause.
 The beauty of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> (22) was the subject of more flattering praise, and the source of more exquisite delight.
 Her features were delicate and regular; her complexion, though somewhat pale, was tinged with a natural color; every sensation was instantly expressed by the vivacity of her eyes; her easy motions displayed the graces of a small but elegant figure; and either love or adulation might proclaim, that painting and poetry were incapable of delineating the matchless excellence of her form.
 But this form was degraded by the facility with which it was exposed to the public eye, and prostituted to licentious desire.
 Her venal charms were abandoned to a promiscuous crowd of citizens and strangers of every rank, and of every profession: the fortunate lover who had been promised a night of enjoyment, was often driven from her bed by a stronger or more wealthy favorite; and when she passed through the streets, her presence was avoided by all who wished to escape either the scandal or the temptation.
 The satirical historian has not blushed (23) to describe the naked scenes which <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> was not ashamed to exhibit in the theatre.
 (24) After exhausting the arts of sensual pleasure, (25) she most ungratefully murmured against the parsimony of Nature; (26) but her murmurs, her pleasures, and her arts, must be veiled in the obscurity of a learned language.
 After reigning for some time, the delight and contempt of the capital, she condescended to accompany Ecebolus, a native of Tyre, who had obtained the government of the <NORP>African</NORP> Pentapolis.
 But this union was frail and transient; <PERSON>Ecebolus</PERSON> soon rejected an expensive or faithless concubine; she was reduced at <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> to extreme distress; and in her laborious return to Constantinople, every city of the <LOC>East</LOC> admired and enjoyed the fair Cyprian, whose merit appeared to justify her descent from the peculiar island of Venus.
 The vague commerce of Theodora, and the most detestable precautions, preserved her from the danger which she feared; yet once, and once only, she became a mother.
 The infant was saved and educated in Arabia, by his father, who imparted to him on his death-bed, that he was the son of an empress.
 Filled with ambitious hopes, the unsuspecting youth immediately hastened to the palace of Constantinople, and was admitted to the presence of his mother.
 As he was never more seen, even after the decease of Theodora, she deserves the foul imputation of extinguishing with his life a secret so offensive to her <NORP>Imperial</NORP> virtue.
 Her marriage with Justinian.
 In the most abject state of her fortune, and reputation, some vision, either of sleep or of fancy, had whispered to <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> the pleasing assurance that she was destined to become the spouse of a potent monarch.
 Conscious of her approaching greatness, she returned from Paphlagonia to Constantinople; assumed, like a skilful actress, a more decent character; relieved her poverty by the laudable industry of spinning wool; and affected a life of chastity and solitude in a small house, which she afterwards changed into a magnificent temple.
 (27) Her beauty, assisted by art or accident, soon attracted, captivated, and fixed, the patrician Justinian, who already reigned with absolute sway under the name of his uncle.
 Perhaps she contrived to enhance the value of a gift which she had so often lavished on the meanest of mankind; perhaps she inflamed, at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> by modest delays, and at last by sensual allurements, the desires of a lover, who, from nature or devotion, was addicted to long vigils and abstemious diet.
 When his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> transports had subsided, she still maintained the same ascendant over his mind, by the more solid merit of temper and understanding.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> delighted to ennoble and enrich the object of his affection; the treasures of the <LOC>East</LOC> were poured at her feet, and the nephew of <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> was determined, perhaps by religious scruples, to bestow on his concubine the sacred and legal character of a wife.
 But the laws of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expressly prohibited the marriage of a senator with any female who had been dishonored by a servile origin or theatrical profession: the empress Lupicina, or Euphemia, a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> of rustic manners, but of irreproachable virtue, refused to accept a prostitute for her niece; and even Vigilantia, the superstitious mother of Justinian, though she acknowledged the wit and beauty of Theodora, was seriously apprehensive, lest the levity and arrogance of that artful paramour might corrupt the piety and happiness of her son.
 These obstacles were removed by the inflexible constancy of Justinian.
 He patiently expected the death of the empress; he despised the tears of his mother, who soon sunk under the weight of her affliction; and a law was promulgated in the name of the emperor Justin, which abolished the rigid jurisprudence of antiquity.
 A glorious repentance (the words of the edict) was left open for the unhappy females who had prostituted their persons on the theatre, and they were permitted to contract a legal union with the most illustrious of the Romans.
 (28) This indulgence was speedily followed by the solemn nuptials of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and Theodora; her dignity was gradually exalted with that of her lover, and, as soon as <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> had invested his nephew with the purple, the patriarch of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> placed the diadem on the heads of the emperor and empress of the East.
 But the usual honors which the severity of <NORP>Roman</NORP> manners had allowed to the wives of princes, could not satisfy either the ambition of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> or the fondness of Justinian.
 He seated her on the throne as an equal and independent colleague in the sovereignty of the empire, and an oath of allegiance was imposed on the governors of the provinces in the joint names of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and Theodora.
 (29) The <NORP>Eastern</NORP> world fell prostrate before the genius and fortune of the daughter of Acacius.
 The prostitute who, in the presence of innumerable spectators, had polluted the theatre of Constantinople, was adored as a queen in the same city, by grave magistrates, orthodox bishops, victorious generals, and captive monarchs.
 (30) Her tyranny.
 Those who believe that the female mind is totally depraved by the loss of chastity, will eagerly listen to all the invectives of private envy, or popular resentment which have dissembled the virtues of Theodora, exaggerated her vices, and condemned with rigor the venal or voluntary sins of the youthful harlot.
 From a motive of shame, or contempt, she often declined the servile homage of the multitude, escaped from the odious light of the capital, and passed the greatest part of the year in the palaces and gardens which were pleasantly seated on the sea-coast of the <NORP>Propontis</NORP> and the Bosphorus.
 Her private hours were devoted to the prudent as well as grateful care of her beauty, the luxury of the bath and table, and the long slumber of the evening and the morning.
 Her secret apartments were occupied by the favorite women and eunuchs, whose interests and passions she indulged at the expense of justice; the most illustrious person ages of the state were crowded into a dark and sultry antechamber, and when at last, after tedious attendance, they were admitted to kiss the feet of Theodora, they experienced, as her humor might suggest, the silent arrogance of an empress, or the capricious levity of a comedian.
 Her rapacious avarice to accumulate an immense treasure, may be excused by the apprehension of her husband's death, which could leave no alternative between ruin and the throne; and fear as well as ambition might exasperate <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> against <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals, who, during the malady of the emperor, had rashly declared that they were not disposed to acquiesce in the choice of the capital.
 But the reproach of cruelty, so repugnant even to her softer vices, has left an indelible stain on the memory of Theodora.
 Her numerous spies observed, and zealously reported, every action, or word, or look, injurious to their royal mistress.
 Whomsoever they accused were cast into her peculiar prisons, (31) inaccessible to the inquiries of justice; and it was rumored, that the torture of the rack, or scourge, had been inflicted in the presence of the female tyrant, insensible to the voice of prayer or of pity.
 (32) Some of these unhappy victims perished in deep, unwholesome dungeons, while others were permitted, after the loss of their limbs, their reason, or their fortunes, to appear in the world, the living monuments of her vengeance, which was commonly extended to the children of those whom she had suspected or injured.
 The senator or bishop, whose death or exile <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> had pronounced, was delivered to a trusty messenger, and his diligence was quickened by a menace from her own mouth.
 Her virtues.
 If the creed of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> had not been tainted with heresy, her exemplary devotion might have atoned, in the opinion of her contemporaries, for pride, avarice, and cruelty.
 But, if she employed her influence to assuage the intolerant fury of the emperor, the present age will allow some merit to her religion, and much indulgence to her speculative errors.
 (34) The name of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> was introduced, with equal honor, in all the pious and charitable foundations of Justinian; and the most benevolent institution of his reign may be ascribed to the sympathy of the empress for her less fortunate sisters, who had been seduced or compelled to embrace the trade of prostitution.
 A palace, on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> side of the Bosphorus, was converted into a stately and spacious monastery, and a liberal maintenance was assigned to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> women, who had been collected from the streets and brothels of Constantinople.
 In this safe and holy retreat, they were devoted to perpetual confinement; and the despair of some, who threw themselves headlong into the sea, was lost in the gratitude of the penitents, who had been delivered from sin and misery by their generous benefactress.
 (35) The prudence of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> is celebrated by <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> himself; and his laws are attributed to the sage counsels of his most reverend wife whom he had received as the gift of the Deity.
 (36) Her courage was displayed amidst the tumult of the people and the terrors of the court.
 Her chastity, from the moment of her union with Justinian, is founded on the silence of her implacable enemies; and although the daughter of <PERSON>Acacius</PERSON> might be satiated with love, yet some applause is due to the firmness of a mind which could sacrifice pleasure and habit to the stronger sense either of duty or interest.
 The wishes and prayers of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> could never obtain the blessing of a lawful son, and she buried an infant daughter, the sole offspring of her marriage.
 (37) Notwithstanding this disappointment, her dominion was permanent and absolute; she preserved, by art or merit, the affections of Justinian; and their seeming dissensions were always fatal to the courtiers who believed them to be sincere.
 Perhaps her health had been impaired by the licentiousness of her youth; but it was always delicate, and she was directed by her physicians to use the <NORP>Pythian</NORP> warm baths.
 In this journey, the empress was followed by the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, the great treasurer, several counts and patricians, and a splendid train of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> attendants: the highways were repaired at her approach; a palace was erected for her reception; and as she passed through Bithynia, she distributed liberal alms to the churches, the monasteries, and the hospitals, that they might implore Heaven for the restoration of her health.
 (38) and death, A.
D.
 548, June 11.
 At length, in the twenty-fourth year of her marriage, and the <DATE>twenty-second</DATE> of her reign, she was consumed by a cancer; (39) and the irreparable loss was deplored by her husband, who, in the room of a theatrical prostitute, might have selected the purest and most noble virgin of the East.
 (40) The factions of the circus.
 II.
 A material difference may be observed in the games of antiquity: the most eminent of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were actors, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were merely spectators.
 The <EVENT>Olympic</EVENT> stadium was open to wealth, merit, and ambition; and if the candidates could depend on their personal skill and activity, they might pursue the footsteps of <PERSON>Diomede</PERSON> and Menelaus, and conduct their own horses in the rapid career.
 (41) Ten, twenty, <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> chariots were allowed to start at the same instant; a crown of leaves was the reward of the victor; and his fame, with that of his family and country, was chanted in lyric strains more durable than monuments of brass and marble.
 But a senator, or even a citizen, conscious of his dignity, would have blushed to expose his person, or his horses, in the circus of Rome.
 The games were exhibited at the expense of the republic, the magistrates, or the emperors: but the reins were abandoned to servile hands; and if the profits of a favorite charioteer sometimes exceeded those of an advocate, they must be considered as the effects of popular extravagance, and the high wages of a disgraceful profession.
 The race, in its <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> institution, was a simple contest of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> chariots, whose drivers were distinguished by white and red liveries: <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> additional colors, a light green, and a caerulean blue, were afterwards introduced; and as the races were repeated <CARDINAL>twenty-five</CARDINAL> times, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> chariots contributed in the same day to the pomp of the circus.
 The <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> factions soon acquired a legal establishment, and a mysterious origin, and their fanciful colors were derived from the various appearances of nature in the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> seasons of the year; the red dogstar of summer, the snows of winter, the deep shades of autumn, and the cheerful verdure of the spring.
 (42) Another interpretation preferred the elements to the seasons, and the struggle of the green and blue was supposed to represent the conflict of the earth and sea.
 Their respective victories announced either a plentiful harvest or a prosperous navigation, and the hostility of the husbandmen and mariners was somewhat less absurd than the blind ardor of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, who devoted their lives and fortunes to the color which they had espoused.
 Such folly was disdained and indulged by the wisest princes; but the names of Caligula, Nero, Vitellius, Verus, Commodus, Caracalla, and Elagabalus, were enrolled in the blue or green factions of the circus; At Rome.
 they frequented their stables, applauded their favorites, chastised their antagonists, and deserved the esteem of the populace, by the natural or affected imitation of their manners.
 The bloody and tumultuous contest continued to disturb the public festivity, till the last age of the spectacles of Rome; and Theodoric, from a motive of justice or affection, interposed his authority to protect the greens against the violence of a consul and a patrician, who were passionately addicted to the blue faction of the circus.
 (43) They distract <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the East.
 <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> adopted the follies, though not the virtues, of ancient Rome; and the same factions which had agitated the circus, raged with redoubled fury in the hippodrome.
 Under the reign of Anastasius, this popular frenzy was inflamed by religious zeal; and the greens, who had treacherously concealed stones and daggers under baskets of fruit, massacred, at a solemn festival, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of their blue adversaries.
 (44) From this capital, the pestilence was diffused into the provinces and cities of the East, and the sportive distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> colors produced <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> strong and irreconcilable factions, which shook the foundations of a feeble government.
 (45) The popular dissensions, founded on the most serious interest, or holy pretence, have scarcely equalled the obstinacy of this wanton discord, which invaded the peace of families, divided friends and brothers, and tempted the female sex, though seldom seen in the circus, to espouse the inclinations of their lovers, or to contradict the wishes of their husbands.
 Every law, either human or divine, was trampled under foot, and as long as the party was successful, its deluded followers appeared careless of private distress or public calamity.
 The license, without the freedom, of democracy, was revived at <GPE>Antioch</GPE> and Constantinople, and the support of a faction became necessary to every candidate for civil or ecclesiastical honors.
 A secret attachment to the family or sect of <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> was imputed to the greens; the blues were zealously devoted to the cause of orthodoxy <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> favours the blues.
 and Justinian, (46) and their grateful patron protected, above <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, the disorders of a faction, whose seasonable tumults overawed the palace, the senate, and the capitals of the East.
 Insolent with royal favor, the blues affected to strike terror by a peculiar and <NORP>Barbaric</NORP> dress, the long hair of the Huns, their close sleeves and ample garments, a lofty step, and a sonorous voice.
 In the day they concealed their two-edged poniards, but in the night they boldly assembled in arms, and in numerous bands, prepared for every act of violence and rapine.
 Their adversaries of the green faction, or even inoffensive citizens, were stripped and often murdered by these nocturnal robbers, and it became dangerous to wear any gold buttons or girdles, or to appear at a late hour in the streets of a peaceful capital.
 A daring spirit, rising with impunity, proceeded to violate the safeguard of private houses; and fire was employed to facilitate the attack, or to conceal the crimes of these factious rioters.
 No place was safe or sacred from their depredations; to gratify either avarice or revenge, they profusely spilt the blood of the innocent; churches and altars were polluted by atrocious murders; and it was the boast of the assassins, that their dexterity could always inflict a mortal wound with a single stroke of their dagger.
 The dissolute youth of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> adopted the blue livery of disorder; the laws were silent, and the bonds of society were relaxed: creditors were compelled to resign their obligations; judges to reverse their sentence; masters to enfranchise their slaves; fathers to supply the extravagance of their children; noble matrons were prostituted to the lust of their servants; beautiful boys were torn from the arms of their parents; and wives, unless they preferred a voluntary death, were ravished in the presence of their husbands.
 (47) The despair of the greens, who were persecuted by their enemies, and deserted by the magistrates, assumed the privilege of defence, perhaps of retaliation; but those who survived the combat were dragged to execution, and the unhappy fugitives, escaping to woods and caverns, preyed without mercy on the society from whence they were expelled.
 Those ministers of justice who had courage to punish the crimes, and to brave the resentment, of the blues, became the victims of their indiscreet zeal; a praefect of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> fled for refuge to the holy sepulchre, a count of the <LOC>East</LOC> was ignominiously whipped, and a governor of <GPE>Cilicia</GPE> was hanged, by the order of Theodora, on the tomb of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> assassins whom he had condemned for the murder of his groom, and a daring attack upon his own life.
 (48) An aspiring candidate may be tempted to build his greatness on the public confusion, but it is the interest as well as duty of a sovereign to maintain the authority of the laws.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> edict of Justinian, which was often repeated, and sometimes executed, announced his firm resolution to support the innocent, and to chastise the guilty, of every denomination and colour.
 Yet the balance of justice was still inclined in favour of the blue faction, by the secret affection, the habits, and the fears of the emperor; his equity, after an apparent struggle, submitted, without reluctance, to the implacable passions of Theodora, and the empress never forgot, or forgave, the injuries of the comedian.
 At the accession of the younger Justin, the proclamation of equal and rigorous justice indirectly condemned the partiality of the former reign.
 Sedition of Constantinople, surnamed Nika, A.
D.
 532, January.
 A sedition, which almost laid <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> in ashes, was excited by the mutual hatred and momentary reconciliation of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions.
 In the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> year of his reign, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> celebrated the festival of the ides of January; the games were incessantly disturbed by the clamorous discontent of the greens: till the <DATE>twenty-second</DATE> race, the emperor maintained his silent gravity; at length, yielding to his impatience, he condescended to hold, in abrupt sentences, and by the voice of a crier, the most singular dialogue (50) that ever passed between a prince and his subjects.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> complaints were respectful and modest; they accused the subordinate ministers of oppression, and proclaimed their wishes for the long life and victory of the emperor.
 The greens still attempted to awaken his compassion.
 But the repetition of partial and passionate invectives degraded, in their eyes, the majesty of the purple; they renounced allegiance to the prince who refused justice to his people; lamented that the father of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> had been born; and branded his son with the opprobrious names of a homicide, an ass, and a perjured tyrant.
 "Do you despise your lives?" cried the indignant monarch: the blues rose with fury from their seats; their hostile clamours thundered in the hippodrome; and their adversaries, deserting the unequal contest spread terror and despair through the streets of Constantinople.
 At this dangerous moment, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> notorious assassins of both factions, who had been condemned by the praefect, were carried round the city, and afterwards transported to the place of execution in the suburb of Pera.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> were immediately beheaded; a <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was hanged: but when the same punishment was inflicted on the remaining two, the rope broke, they fell alive to the ground, the populace applauded their escape, and the monks of St.
 Conon, issuing from the neighbouring convent, conveyed them in a boat to the sanctuary of the church.
 (51) As <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these criminals was of the blue, and the other of the green livery, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions were equally provoked by the cruelty of their oppressor, or the ingratitude of their patron; and a short truce was concluded till they had delivered their prisoners and satisfied their revenge.
 The palace of the praefect, who withstood the seditious torrent, was instantly burnt, his officers and guards were massacred, the prisons were forced open, and freedom was restored to those who could only use it for the public destruction.
 A military force, which had been despatched to the aid of the civil magistrate, was fiercely encountered by an armed multitude, whose numbers and boldness continually increased; and the Heruli, the wildest <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in the service of the empire, overturned the priests and their relics, which, from a pious motive, had been rashly interposed to separate the bloody conflict.
 The tumult was exasperated by this sacrilege, the people fought with enthusiasm in the cause of God; the women, from the roofs and windows, showered stones on the heads of the soldiers, who darted fire brands against the houses; and the various flames, which had been kindled by the hands of citizens and strangers, spread without control over the face of the city.
 The conflagration involved the cathedral of St.
 Sophia, the baths of Zeuxippus, a part of the palace, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> entrance to the altar of Mars, and the long portico from the palace to the forum of Constantine: a large hospital, with the sick patients, was consumed; many churches and stately edifices were destroyed and an immense treasure of gold and silver was either melted or lost.
 From such scenes of horror and distress, the wise and wealthy citizens escaped over the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> to the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> side; and during <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> days <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was abandoned to the factions, whose watchword, NIKA, vanquish! has given a name to this memorable sedition.
 (52) The distress of Justinian.
 As long as the factions were divided, the triumphant blues, and desponding greens, appeared to behold with the same indifference the disorders of the state.
 They agreed to censure the corrupt management of justice and the finance; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> responsible ministers, the artful Tribonian, and the rapacious <PERSON>John</PERSON> of Cappadocia, were loudly arraigned as the authors of the public misery.
 The peaceful murmurs of the people would have been disregarded: they were heard with respect when the city was in flames; the quaestor, and the praefect, were instantly removed, and their offices were filled by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> senators of blameless integrity.
 After this popular concession, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> proceeded to the hippodrome to confess his own errors, and to accept the repentance of his grateful subjects; but they distrusted his assurances, though solemnly pronounced in the presence of the holy Gospels; and the emperor, alarmed by their distrust, retreated with precipitation to the strong fortress of the palace.
 The obstinacy of the tumult was now imputed to a secret and ambitious conspiracy, and a suspicion was entertained, that the insurgents, more especially the green faction, had been supplied with arms and money by <PERSON>Hypatius</PERSON> and Pompey, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> patricians, who could neither forget with honor, nor remember with safety, that they were the nephews of the emperor Anastasius.
 Capriciously trusted, disgraced, and pardoned, by the jealous levity of the monarch, they had appeared as loyal servants before the throne; and, during <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> days of the tumult, they were detained as important hostages; till at length, the fears of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> prevailing over his prudence, he viewed the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers in the light of spies, perhaps of assassins, and sternly commanded them to depart from the palace.
 After a fruitless representation, that obedience might lead to involuntary treason, they retired to their houses, and in the morning of the sixth day, <PERSON>Hypatius</PERSON> was surrounded and seized by the people, who, regardless of his virtuous resistance, and the tears of his wife, transported their favorite to the forum of Constantine, and instead of a diadem, placed a rich collar on his head.
 If the usurper, who afterwards pleaded the merit of his delay, had complied with the advice of his senate, and urged the fury of the multitude, their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> irresistible effort might have oppressed or expelled his trembling competitor.
 The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace enjoyed a free communication with the sea; vessels lay ready at the garden stairs; and a secret resolution was already formed, to convey the emperor with his family and treasures to a safe retreat, at some distance from the capital.
 Firmness of Theodora.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was lost, if the prostitute whom he raised from the theatre had not renounced the timidity, as well as the virtues, of her sex.
 In the midst of a council, where <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was present, <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> alone displayed the spirit of a hero; and she alone, without apprehending his future hatred, could save the emperor from the imminent danger, and his unworthy fears.
 The firmness of a woman restored the courage to deliberate and act, and courage soon discovers the resources of the most desperate situation.
 It was an easy and a decisive measure to revive the animosity of the factions; the blues were astonished at their own guilt and folly, that a trifling injury should provoke them to conspire with their implacable enemies against a gracious and liberal benefactor; The sedition is surpressed.
 they again proclaimed the majesty of Justinian; and the greens, with their upstart emperor, were left alone in the hippodrome.
 The fidelity of the guards was doubtful; but the military force of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> consisted in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans, who had been trained to valour and discipline in the <NORP>Persian</NORP> and <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> wars.
 Under the command of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> and Mundus, they silently marched in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> divisions from the palace, forced their obscure way through narrow passages, expiring flames, and falling edifices, and burst open at the same moment the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> opposite gates of the hippodrome.
 In this narrow space, the disorderly and affrighted crowd was incapable of resisting on either side a firm and regular attack; the blues signalized the fury of their repentance; and it is computed, that above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> persons were slain in the merciless and promiscuous carnage of the day.
 <PERSON>Hypatius</PERSON> was dragged from his throne, and conducted, with his brother Pompey, to the feet of the emperor: they implored his clemency; but their crime was manifest, their innocence uncertain, and <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> had been too much terrified to forgive.
 The next morning the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nephews of Anastasius, with <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> illustrious accomplices, of patrician or consular rank, were privately executed by the soldiers; their bodies were thrown into the sea, their palaces razed, and their fortunes confiscated.
 The hippodrome itself was condemned, during several years, to a mournful silence: with the restoration of the games, the same disorders revived; and the blue and green factions continued to afflict the reign of Justinian, and to disturb the tranquility of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 (53) Agriculture and manufactures of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 III.
 That empire, after <GPE>Rome</GPE> was barbarous, still embraced the nations whom she had conquered beyond the Adriatic, and as far as the frontiers of <GPE>Aethiopia</GPE> and Persia.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> reigned over <CARDINAL>sixty-four</CARDINAL> provinces, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and thirty-five cities; (54) his dominions were blessed by nature with the advantages of soil, situation, and climate: and the improvements of human art had been perpetually diffused along the coast of the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> and the banks of the <LOC>Nile</LOC> from ancient <LOC>Troy</LOC> to the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> Thebes.
 <PERSON>Abraham</PERSON> (55) had been relieved by the well-known plenty of Egypt; the same country, a small and populous tract, was still capable of exporting, each year, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> quarters of wheat for the use of Constantinople; (56) and the capital of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was supplied with the manufactures of Sidon, fifteen centuries after they had been celebrated in the poems of Homer.
 (57) The <DATE>annual</DATE> powers of vegetation, instead of being exhausted by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> harvests, were renewed and invigorated by skilful husbandry, rich manure, and seasonable repose.
 The breed of domestic animals was infinitely multiplied.
 Plantations, buildings, and the instruments of labour and luxury, which are more durable than the term of human life, were accumulated by the care of successive generations.
 Tradition preserved, and experience simplified, the humble practice of the arts: society was enriched by the division of labour and the facility of exchange; and every <NORP>Roman</NORP> was lodged, clothed, and subsisted, by the industry of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> hands.
 The invention of the loom and distaff has been piously ascribed to the gods.
 In every age, a variety of animal and vegetable productions, hair, skins, wool, flax, cotton, and at length silk, have been skilfully manufactured to hide or adorn the human body; they were stained with an infusion of permanent colours; and the pencil was successfully employed to improve the labors of the loom.
 In the choice of those colours (58) which imitate the beauties of nature, the freedom of taste and fashion was indulged; but the deep purple (59) which the <NORP>Phoenicians</NORP> extracted from a shell-fish, was restrained to the sacred person and palace of the emperor; and the penalties of treason were denounced against the ambitious subjects who dared to usurp the prerogative of the throne.
 (60) The use of silk by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> I need not explain that silk (61) is originally spun from the bowels of a caterpillar, and that it composes the golden tomb, from whence a worm emerges in the form of a butterfly.
 Till the reign of Justinian, the silk-worm who feed on the leaves of the white mulberry-tree were confined to China; those of the pine, the oak, and the ash, were common in the forests both of <LOC>Asia</LOC> and Europe; but as their education is more difficult, and their produce more uncertain, they were generally neglected, except in the little island of Ceos, near the coast of Attica.
 A thin gauze was procured from their webs, and this <PRODUCT>Cean</PRODUCT> manufacture, the invention of a woman, for female use, was long admired both in the <LOC>East</LOC> and at Rome.
 Whatever suspicions may be raised by the garments of the <NORP>Medes</NORP> and Assyrians, <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> is the most ancient writer, who expressly mentions the soft wool which was combed from the trees of the <NORP>Seres</NORP> or Chinese; (62) and this natural error, less marvellous than the truth, was slowly corrected by the knowledge of a valuable insect, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> artificer of the luxury of nations.
 That rare and elegant luxury was censured, in the reign of Tiberius, by the gravest of the Romans; and Pliny, in affected though forcible language, has condemned the thirst of gain, which explores the last confines of the earth, for the pernicious purpose of exposing to the public eye naked draperies and transparent matrons.
 (63) A dress which showed the turn of the limbs, and color of the skin, might gratify vanity, or provoke desire; the silks which had been closely woven in <GPE>China</GPE> were sometimes unravelled by the <NORP>Phoenician</NORP> women, and the precious materials were multiplied by a looser texture, and the intermixture of linen threads.
 (64) <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years after the age of Pliny, the use of pure, or even of mixed silks, was confined to the female sex, till the opulent citizens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the provinces were insensibly familiarized with the example of Elagabalus, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who, by this effeminate habit, had sullied the dignity of an emperor and a man.
 <NORP>Aurelian</NORP> complained, that a pound of silk was sold at <GPE>Rome</GPE> for <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> ounces of gold; but the supply increased with the demand, and the price diminished with the supply.
 If accident or monopoly sometimes raised the value even above the standard of Aurelian, the manufacturers of <ORG>Tyre</ORG> and <PERSON>Berytus</PERSON> were sometimes compelled, by the operation of the same causes, to content themselves with a <ORDINAL>ninth</ORDINAL> part of that extravagant rate.
 (65) A law was thought necessary to discriminate the dress of comedians from that of senators; and of the silk exported from its native country the far greater part was consumed by the subjects of Justinian.
 They were still more intimately acquainted with a shell-fish of the Mediterranean, surnamed the silk-worm of the sea: the fine wool or hair by which the mother-of-pearl affixes itself to the rock is now manufactured for curiosity rather than use; and a robe obtained from the same singular materials was the gift of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor to the satraps of Armenia.
 (66)Importation from <GPE>China</GPE> by land and sea.
 A valuable merchandise of small bulk is capable of defraying the expense of land-carriage; and the caravans traversed the whole latitude of <LOC>Asia</LOC> in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and forty-three days from the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> Ocean to the sea-coast of Syria.
 Silk was immediately delivered to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the <NORP>Persian</NORP> merchants, (67) who frequented the fairs of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and Nisibis; but this trade, which in the intervals of truce was oppressed by avarice and jealousy, was totally interrupted by the long wars of the rival monarchies.
 The great king might proudly number Sogdiana, and even Serica, among the provinces of his empire; but his real dominion was bounded by the <PERSON>Oxus</PERSON> and his useful intercourse with the Sogdoites, beyond the river, depended on the pleasure of their conquerors, the white Huns, and the Turks, who successively reigned over that industrious people.
 Yet the most savage dominion has not extirpated the seeds of agriculture and commerce, in a region which is celebrated as <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> gardens of Asia; the cities of <GPE>Samarcand</GPE> and <GPE>Bochara</GPE> are advantageously seated for the exchange of its various productions; and their merchants purchased from the Chinese, (68) the raw or manufactured silk which they transported into <GPE>Persia</GPE> for the use of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 In the vain capital of China, the <NORP>Sogdian</NORP> caravans were entertained as the suppliant embassies of tributary kingdoms, and if they returned in safety, the bold adventure was rewarded with exorbitant gain.
 But the difficult and perilous march from <GPE>Samarcand</GPE> to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> town of Shensi, could not be performed in less than sixty, eighty, or <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> days: as soon as they had passed the <NORP>Jaxartes</NORP> they entered the desert; and the wandering hordes, unless they are restrained by armies and garrisons, have always considered the citizen and the traveller as the objects of lawful rapine.
 To escape the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> robbers, and the tyrants of Persia, the silk caravans explored a more southern road; they traversed the mountains of Thibet, descended the streams of the <LOC>Ganges</LOC> or the Indus, and patiently expected, in the ports of <GPE>Guzerat</GPE> and Malabar, the <DATE>annual</DATE> fleets of the <LOC>West.
</LOC> (69) But the dangers of the desert were found less intolerable than toil, hunger, and the loss of time; the attempt was seldom renewed, and the only <NORP>European</NORP> who has passed that unfrequented way, applauds his own diligence, that, in <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> months after his departure from Pekin, he reached the mouth of the Indus.
 The ocean, however, was open to the free communication of mankind.
 From the great river to the tropic of Cancer, the provinces of <GPE>China</GPE> were subdued and civilized by the emperors of the North; they were filled about the time of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aera with cities and men, mulberry- trees and their precious inhabitants; and if the Chinese, with the knowledge of the compass, had possessed the genius of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> or Phoenicians, they might have spread their discoveries over the southern hemisphere.
 I am not qualified to examine, and I am not disposed to believe, their distant voyages to the <NORP>Persian</NORP> Gulf, or the Cape of Good Hope; but their ancestors might equal the labors and success of the present race, and the sphere of their navigation might extend from the Isles of Japan to the Straits of Malacca, the pillars, if we may apply that name, of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> Hercules.
 (70) Without losing sight of land, they might sail along the coast to the extreme promontory of Achin, which is annually visited by <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> ships laden with the productions, the manufactures, and even the artificers of China; the Island of <GPE>Sumatra</GPE> and the opposite peninsula are faintly delineated (71) as the regions of gold and silver; and the trading cities named in the geography of <LOC>Ptolemy</LOC> may indicate, that this wealth was not solely derived from the mines.
 The direct interval between <GPE>Sumatra</GPE> and <GPE>Ceylon</GPE> is about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> leagues: the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> and <NORP>Indian</NORP> navigators were conducted by the flight of birds and periodical winds; and the ocean might be securely traversed in square-built ships, which, instead of iron, were sewed together with the strong thread of the cocoanut.
 Ceylon, Serendib, or Taprobana, was divided between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile princes; <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of whom possessed the mountains, the elephants, and the luminous carbuncle, and the other enjoyed the more solid riches of domestic industry, foreign trade, and the capacious harbor of Trinquemale, which received and dismissed the fleets of the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West.
</LOC> In this hospitable isle, at an equal distance (as it was computed) from their respective countries, the silk merchants of China, who had collected in their voyages aloes, cloves, nutmeg, and sandal wood, maintained a free and beneficial commerce with the inhabitants of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> Gulf.
 The subjects of the great king exalted, without a rival, his power and magnificence: and the Roman, who confounded their vanity by comparing his paltry coin with a gold medal of the emperor Anastasius, had sailed to Ceylon, in an <NORP>Aethiopian</NORP> ship, as a simple passenger.
 (72) Introducion of silk-worms into <GPE>Greece</GPE> As silk became of indispensable use, the emperor <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> saw with concern that the <NORP>Persians</NORP> had occupied by land and sea the monopoly of this important supply, and that the wealth of his subjects was continually drained by a nation of enemies and idolaters.
 An active government would have restored the trade of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the navigation of the Red Sea, which had decayed with the prosperity of the empire; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> vessels might have sailed, for the purchase of silk, to the ports of Ceylon, of Malacca, or even of China.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> embraced a more humble expedient, and solicited the aid of his <NORP>Christian</NORP> allies, the <NORP>Aethiopians</NORP> of Abyssinia, who had recently acquired the arts of navigation, the spirit of trade, and the seaport of Adulis, (73) still decorated with the trophies of a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> conqueror.
 Along the <NORP>African</NORP> coast, they penetrated to the equator in search of gold, emeralds, and aromatics; but they wisely declined an unequal competition, in which they must be always prevented by the vicinity of the <NORP>Persians</NORP> to the markets of India; and the emperor submitted to the disappointment, till his wishes were gratified by an unexpected event.
 The gospel had been preached to the Indians: a bishop already governed the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of St.
 Thomas on the pepper-coast of Malabar; a church was planted in Ceylon, and the missionaries pursued the footsteps of commerce to the extremities of Asia.
 (74) <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Persian</NORP> monks had long resided in China, perhaps in the royal city of Nankin, the seat of a monarch addicted to foreign superstitions, and who actually received an embassy from the Isle of Ceylon.
 Amidst their pious occupations, they viewed with a curious eye the common dress of the Chinese, the manufactures of silk, and the myriads of silk-worms, whose education (either on trees or in houses) had once been considered as the labor of queens.
 (75) They soon discovered that it was impracticable to transport the short-lived insect, but that in the eggs a numerous progeny might be preserved and multiplied in a distant climate.
 Religion or interest had more power over the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monks than the love of their country: after a long journey, they arrived at Constantinople, imparted their project to the emperor, and were liberally encouraged by the gifts and promises of Justinian.
 To the historians of that prince, a campaign at the foot of Mount Caucasus has seemed more deserving of a minute relation than the labors of these missionaries of commerce, who again entered China, deceived a jealous people by concealing the eggs of the silk-worm in a hollow cane, and returned in triumph with the spoils of the East.
 Under their direction, the eggs were hatched at the proper season by the artificial heat of dung; the worms were fed with mulberry leaves; they lived and labored in a foreign climate; a sufficient number of butterflies was saved to propagate the race, and trees were planted to supply the nourishment of the rising generations.
 Experience and reflection corrected the errors of a new attempt, and the <NORP>Sogdoite</NORP> ambassadors acknowledged, in the succeeding reign, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were not inferior to the natives of <GPE>China</GPE> in the education of the insects, and the manufactures of silk, (76) in which both <GPE>China</GPE> and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> have been surpassed by the industry of modern Europe.
 I am not insensible of the benefits of elegant luxury; yet I reflect with some pain, that if the importers of silk had introduced the art of printing, already practised by the Chinese, the comedies of <PERSON>Menander</PERSON> and the entire decads of <WORK_OF_ART>Livy</WORK_OF_ART> would have been perpetuated in the editions of the sixth century.
 A larger view of the globe might at least have promoted the improvement of speculative science, but the <NORP>Christian</NORP> geography was forcibly extracted from texts of Scripture, and the study of nature was the surest symptom of an unbelieving mind.
 The orthodox faith confined the habitable world to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> temperate zone, and represented the earth as an oblong surface, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> days' journey in length, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> in breadth, encompassed by the ocean, and covered by the solid crystal of the firmament.
 (77) State of the revenue.
 IV.
 The subjects of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> were dissatisfied with the times, and with the government.
 <LOC>Europe</LOC> was overrun by the Barbarians, and <LOC>Asia</LOC> by the monks: the poverty of the <LOC>West</LOC> discouraged the trade and manufactures of the East: the produce of labor was consumed by the unprofitable servants of the church, the state, and the army; and a rapid decrease was felt in the fixed and circulating capitals which constitute the national wealth.
 The public distress had been alleviated by the economy of Anastasius, and that prudent emperor accumulated an immense treasure, while he delivered his people from the most odious or oppressive taxes.
 Their gratitude universally applauded the abolition of the gold of affliction, a personal tribute on the industry of the poor, (78) but more intolerable, as it should seem, in the form than in the substance, since the flourishing city of <PERSON>Edessa</PERSON> paid only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, which was collected in <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years from <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> artificers.
 (79) Yet such was the parsimony which supported this liberal disposition, that, in a reign of twenty-seven years, <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> saved, from his <DATE>annual</DATE> revenue, the enormous sum of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> sterling, or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold.
 (80) His example was neglected, and his treasure was abused, by the nephew of Justin.
 Avarice and profusion of Justinian.
 The riches of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> were speedily exhausted by alms and buildings, by ambitious wars, and ignominious treaties.
 His revenues were found inadequate to his expenses.
 Every art was tried to extort from the people the gold and silver which he scattered with a lavish hand from <GPE>Persia</GPE> to France: (81) his reign was marked by the vicissitudes or rather by the combat, of rapaciousness and avarice, of splendor and poverty; he lived with the reputation of hidden treasures, (82) and bequeathed to his successor the payment of his debts.
 (83) Such a character has been justly accused by the voice of the people and of posterity: but public discontent is credulous; private malice is bold; and a lover of truth will peruse with a suspicious eye the instructive anecdotes of Procopius.
 The secret historian represents only the vices of Justinian, and those vices are darkened by his malevolent pencil.
 Ambiguous actions are imputed to the worst motives; error is confounded with guilt, accident with design, and laws with abuses; the partial injustice of a moment is dexterously applied as the general maxim of a reign of thirty-two years; the emperor alone is made responsible for the faults of his officers, the disorders of the times, and the corruption of his subjects; and even the calamities of nature, plagues, earthquakes, and inundations, are imputed to the prince of the daemons, who had mischievously assumed the form of Justinian.
 (84) Pernicious savings After this precaution, I shall briefly relate the anecdotes of avarice and rapine under the following heads: I.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was so profuse that he could not be liberal.
 The civil and military officers, when they were admitted into the service of the palace, obtained an humble rank and a moderate stipend; they ascended by seniority to a station of affluence and repose; the <DATE>annual</DATE> pensions, of which the most honorable class was abolished by Justinian, amounted to <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds; and this domestic economy was deplored by the venal or indigent courtiers as the last outrage on the majesty of the empire.
 The posts, the salaries of physicians, and the nocturnal illuminations, were objects of more general concern; and the cities might justly complain, that he usurped the municipal revenues which had been appropriated to these useful institutions.
 Even the soldiers were injured; and such was the decay of military spirit, that they were injured with impunity.
 The emperor refused, at the return of each <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> year, the customary donative of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, reduced his veterans to beg their bread, and suffered unpaid armies to melt away in the wars of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Persia.
 II.
 Remittances The humanity of his predecessors had always remitted, in some auspicious circumstance of their reign, the arrears of the public tribute, and they dexterously assumed the merit of resigning those claims which it was impracticable to enforce.
 Such is the language of the secret historian, who expressly denies that any indulgence was granted to <GPE>Palestine</GPE> after the revolt of the Samaritans; a false and odious charge, confuted by the authentic record which attests a relief of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> centenaries of gold (fifty-two <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds) obtained for that desolate province by the intercession of St.
 Sabas.
 (85) III.
 <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> has not condescended to explain the system of taxation, which fell like a hail-storm upon the land, like a devouring pestilence on its inhabitants: but we should become the accomplices of his malignity, if we imputed to <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> alone the ancient though rigorous principle, that a whole district should be condemned to sustain the partial loss of the persons or property of individuals.
 Taxes The Anona, or supply of corn for the use of the army and capital, was a grievous and arbitrary exaction, which exceeded, perhaps in a tenfold proportion, the ability of the farmer; and his distress was aggravated by the partial injustice of weights and measures, and the expense and labor of distant carriage.
 In a time of scarcity, an extraordinary requisition was made to the adjacent provinces of Thrace, Bithynia, and Phrygia: but the proprietors, after a wearisome journey and perilous navigation, received so inadequate a compensation, that they would have chosen the alternative of delivering both the corn and price at the doors of their granaries.
 These precautions might indicate a tender solicitude for the welfare of the capital; yet <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> did not escape the rapacious despotism of Justinian.
 Till his reign, the Straits of the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> and <GPE>Hellespont</GPE> were open to the freedom of trade, and nothing was prohibited except the exportation of arms for the service of the Barbarians.
 At each of these gates of the city, a praetor was stationed, the minister of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> avarice; heavy customs were imposed on the vessels and their merchandise; the oppression was retaliated on the helpless consumer; the poor were afflicted by the artificial scarcity, and exorbitant price of the market; and a people, accustomed to depend on the liberality of their prince, might sometimes complain of the deficiency of water and bread.
 (86) The aerial tribute, without a name, a law, or a definite object, was an <DATE>annual</DATE> gift of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds, which the emperor accepted from his <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect; and the means of payment were abandoned to the discretion of that powerful magistrate.
 IV.
 Monopolies Even such a tax was less intolerable than the privilege of monopolies, which checked the fair competition of industry, and, for the sake of a small and dishonest gain, imposed an arbitrary burden on the wants and luxury of the subject.
 A province might suffer by the decay of its manufactures, but in this example of silk, <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> has partially overlooked the inestimable and lasting benefit which the empire received from the curiosity of Justinian.
 His addition of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> seventh to the ordinary price of copper money may be interpreted with the same candour; and the alteration, which might be wise, appears to have been innocent; since he neither alloyed the purity, nor enhanced the value, of the gold coin, (87) the legal measure of public and private payments.
 V.
 Venality The ample jurisdiction required by the farmers of the revenue to accomplish their engagements might be placed in an odious light, as if they had purchased from the emperor the lives and fortunes of their fellow-citizens.
 And a more direct sale of honours and offices was transacted in the palace, with the permission, or at least with the connivance, of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and Theodora.
 The claims of merit, even those of fervour, were disregarded, and it was almost reasonable to expect, that the bold adventurer, who had undertaken the trade of a magistrate, should find a rich compensation for infamy, labour, danger, the debts which he had contracted, and the heavy interest which he paid.
 A sense of the disgrace and mischief of this venal practice, at length awakened the slumbering virtue of Justinian; and he attempted, by the sanction of oaths (88) and penalties, to guard the integrity of his government: but at the end of a year of perjury, his rigorous edict was suspended, and corruption licentiously abused her triumph over the impotence of the laws.
 VI.
 Testaments The testament of Eulalius, count of the domestics, declared the emperor his sole heir, on condition, however, that he should discharge his debts and legacies, allow to his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> daughters a decent maintenance, and bestow each of them in marriage, with a portion of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> pounds of gold.
 But the splendid fortune of <PERSON>Eulalius</PERSON> had been consumed by fire, and the inventory of his goods did not exceed the trifling sum of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>sixty-four</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 A similar instance, in <NORP>Grecian</NORP> history, admonished the emperor of the honourable part prescribed for his imitation.
 He checked the selfish murmurs of the treasury, applauded the confidence of his friend, discharged the legacies and debts, educated the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> virgins under the eye of the empress Theodora, and doubled the marriage portion which had satisfied the tenderness of their father.
 (89) The humanity of a prince (for princes cannot be generous) is entitled to some praise; yet even in this act of virtue we may discover the inveterate custom of supplanting the legal or natural heirs, which <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> imputes to the reign of Justinian.
 His charge is supported by eminent names and scandalous examples; neither widows nor orphans were spared; and the art of soliciting, or extorting, or supposing testaments, was beneficially practised by the agents of the palace.
 This base and mischievous tyranny invades the security of private life; and the monarch who has indulged an appetite for gain, will soon be tempted to anticipate the moment of succession, to interpret wealth as an evidence of guilt, and to proceed, from the claim of inheritance, to the power of confiscation.
 VII.
 Among the forms of rapine, a philosopher may be permitted to name the conversion of <NORP>Pagan</NORP> or heretical riches to the use of the faithful; but in the time of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> this holy plunder was condemned by the sectaries alone, who became the victims of his orthodox avarice.
 (90) The ministers of Justinian.
 Dishonour might be ultimately reflected on the character of Justinian; but much of the guilt, and still more of the profit, was intercepted by the ministers, who were seldom promoted for their virtues, and not always selected for their talents.
 (91) The merits of <PERSON>Tribonian</PERSON> the quaestor will hereafter be weighed in the reformation of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> law; but the economy of the <LOC>East</LOC> was subordinate to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, and <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> has justified his anecdotes by the portrait which he exposes in his public history, of the notorious vices of <PERSON>John</PERSON> of Cappadocia.
 (92) His knowledge was not borrowed from the schools, (93) and his style was scarcely legible; but he excelled in the powers of native genius, to suggest the wisest counsels, and to find expedients in the most desperate situations.
 The corruption of his heart was equal to the vigour of his understanding.
 Although he was suspected of magic and <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, he appeared insensible to the fear of God or the reproaches of man; and his aspiring fortune was raised on the death of thousands, the poverty of millions, the ruins of cities, and the desolation of provinces.
 From the dawn of light to the moment of dinner, he assiduously laboured to enrich his master and himself at the expense of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; the remainder of the day was spent in sensual and obscene pleasures, and the silent hours of the night were interrupted by the perpetual dread of the justice of an assassin.
 His abilities, perhaps his vices, recommended him to the lasting friendship of Justinian: the emperor yielded with reluctance to the fury of the people; his victory was displayed by the immediate restoration of their enemy; and they felt above <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years, under his oppressive administration, that he was stimulated by revenge, rather than instructed by misfortune.
 Their murmurs served only to fortify the resolution of Justinian; but the resentment of Theodora, disdained a power before which every knee was bent, and attempted to sow the seeds of discord between the emperor and his beloved consort.
 Even <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> herself was constrained to dissemble, to wait a favourable moment, and, by an artful conspiracy, to render <PERSON>John</PERSON> of Coppadocia the accomplice of his own destruction.
 At a time when Belisarius, unless he had been a hero, must have shown himself a rebel, his wife Antonina, who enjoyed the secret confidence of the empress, communicated his feigned discontent to Euphemia, the daughter of the praefect; the credulous virgin imparted to her father the dangerous project, and John, who might have known the value of oaths and promises, was tempted to accept a nocturnal, and almost treasonable, interview with the wife of Belisarius.
 An ambuscade of guards and eunuchs had been posted by the command of Theodora; they rushed with drawn swords to seize or to punish the guilty minister: he was saved by the fidelity of his attendants; but instead of appealing to a gracious sovereign, who had privately warned him of his danger, he pusillanimously fled to the sanctuary of the church.
 The favourite of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was sacrificed to conjugal tenderness or domestic tranquility; the conversion of a praefect into a priest extinguished his ambitious hopes: but the friendship of the emperor alleviated his disgrace, and he retained in the mild exile of <GPE>Cyzicus</GPE> an ample portion of his riches.
 Such imperfect revenge could not satisfy the unrelenting hatred of Theodora; the murder of his old enemy, the bishop of Cyzicus, afforded a decent pretence; and <PERSON>John</PERSON> of Cappadocia, whose actions had deserved a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> deaths, was at last condemned for a crime of which he was innocent.
 A great minister, who had been invested with the honours of consul and patrician, was ignominiously scourged like the vilest of malefactors; a tattered cloak was the sole remnant of his fortunes; he was transported in a bark to the place of his banishment at <GPE>Antinopolis</GPE> in Upper Egypt, and the praefect of the <LOC>East</LOC> begged his bread through the cities which had trembled at his name.
 During an exile of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years, his life was protracted and threatened by the ingenious cruelty of Theodora; and when her death permitted the emperor to recall a servant whom he had abandoned with regret, the ambition of <PERSON>John</PERSON> of <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> was reduced to the humble duties of the sacerdotal profession.
 His successors convinced the subjects of Justinian, that the arts of oppression might still be improved by experience and industry; the frauds of a <NORP>Syrian</NORP> banker were introduced into the administration of the finances; and the example of the praefect was diligently copied by the quaestor, the public and private treasurer, the governors of provinces, and the principal magistrates of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 (94) His edifices and architects.
 V.
 The edifices of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> were cemented with the blood and treasure of his people; but those stately structures appeared to announce the prosperity of the empire, and actually displayed the skill of their architects.
 Both the theory and practice of the arts which depend on mathematical science and mechanical power, were cultivated under the patronage of the emperors; the fame of <PRODUCT>Archimedes</PRODUCT> was rivalled by <PERSON>Proclus</PERSON> and Anthemius; and if their miracles had been related by intelligent spectators, they might now enlarge the speculations, instead of exciting the distrust, of philosophers.
 A tradition has prevailed, that the <NORP>Roman</NORP> fleet was reduced to ashes in the port of Syracuse, by the burning-glasses of Archimedes; (95) and it is asserted, that a similar expedient was employed by <PERSON>Proclus</PERSON> to destroy the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> vessels in the harbour of Constantinople, and to protect his benefactor <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> against the bold enterprise of Vitalian.
 (96) A machine was fixed on the walls of the city, consisting of a hexagon mirror of polished brass, with many smaller and movable polygons to receive and reflect the rays of the meridian sun; and a consuming flame was darted, to the distance, perhaps of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> feet.
 (97) The truth of these <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> extraordinary facts is invalidated by the silence of the most authentic historians; and the use of burning-glasses was never adopted in the attack or defence of places.
 (98) Yet the admirable experiments of a <NORP>French</NORP> philosopher (99) have demonstrated the possibility of such a mirror; and, since it is possible, I am more disposed to attribute the art to the greatest mathematicians of antiquity, than to give the merit of the fiction to the idle fancy of a monk or a sophist.
 According to another story, <PERSON>Proclus</PERSON> applied sulphur to the destruction of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> fleet; (100) in a modern imagination, the name of sulphur is instantly connected with the suspicion of gunpowder, and that suspicion is propagated by the secret arts of his disciple Anthemius.
 (101) A citizen of <GPE>Tralles</GPE> in <LOC>Asia</LOC> had <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> sons, who were all distinguished in their respective professions by merit and success.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> excelled in the knowledge and practice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence.
 <PERSON>Dioscorus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> became learned physicians; but the skill of the former was exercised for the benefit of his fellow-citizens, while his more ambitious brother acquired wealth and reputation at Rome.
 The fame of <NORP>Metrodorus</NORP> the grammarian, and of <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> the mathematician and architect, reached the ears of the emperor Justinian, who invited them to Constantinople; and while the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> instructed the rising generation in the schools of eloquence, the other filled the capital and provinces with more lasting monuments of his art.
 In a trifling dispute relative to the walls or windows of their contiguous houses, he had been vanquished by the eloquence of his neighbour Zeno; but the orator was defeated in his turn by the master of mechanics, whose malicious, though harmless, stratagems are darkly represented by the ignorance of Agathias.
 In a lower room, <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> arranged several vessels or caldrons of water, each of them covered by the wide bottom of a leathern tube, which rose to a narrow top, and was artificially conveyed among the joists and rafters of the adjacent building.
 A fire was kindled beneath the caldron; the steam of the boiling water ascended through the tubes; the house was shaken by the efforts of imprisoned air, and its trembling inhabitants might wonder that the city was unconscious of the earthquake which they had felt.
 At another time, the friends of Zeno, as they sat at table, were dazzled by the intolerable light which flashed in their eyes from the reflecting mirrors of Anthemius; they were astonished by the noise which he produced from the collision of certain minute and sonorous particles; and the orator declared in tragic style to the senate, that a mere mortal must yield to the power of an antagonist, who shook the earth with the trident of Neptune, and imitated the thunder and lightning of <PERSON>Jove</PERSON> himself.
 The genius of Anthemius, and his colleague <PERSON>Isidore</PERSON> the Milesian, was excited and employed by a prince, whose taste for architecture had degenerated into a mischievous and costly passion.
 His favourite architects submitted their designs and difficulties to Justinian, and discreetly confessed how much their laborious meditations were surpassed by the intuitive knowledge of celestial inspiration of an emperor, whose views were always directed to the benefit of his people, the glory of his reign, and the salvation of his soul.
 (102) Foundation of the church of St.
 Sophia.
 The principal church, which was dedicated by the founder of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to St.
 Sophia, or the eternal wisdom, had been twice destroyed by fire; after the exile of <PERSON>John</PERSON> Chrysostom, and during the <PERSON>Nika</PERSON> of the blue and green factions.
 No sooner did the tumult subside, than the <NORP>Christian</NORP> populace deplored their sacrilegious rashness; but they might have rejoiced in the calamity, had they foreseen the glory of the new temple, which at the end of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> days was strenuously undertaken by the piety of Justinian.
 (103) The ruins were cleared away, a more spacious plan was described, and as it required the consent of some proprietors of ground, they obtained the most exorbitant terms from the eager desires and timorous conscience of the monarch.
 <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> formed the design, and his genius directed the hands of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> workmen, whose payment in pieces of fine silver was never delayed beyond the evening.
 The emperor himself, clad in a linen tunic, surveyed each day their rapid progress, and encouraged their diligence by his familiarity, his zeal, and his rewards.
 The new Cathedral of St.
 <GPE>Sophia</GPE> was consecrated by the patriarch, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> months, and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> foundation; and in the midst of the solemn festival <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> exclaimed with devout vanity, But the pride of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> Solomon, before <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years had elapsed, was humbled by an earthquake, which overthrew the eastern part of the dome.
 Its splendor was again restored by the perseverance of the same prince; and in the thirty- sixth year of his reign, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> celebrated the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> dedication of a temple which remains, after <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> centuries, a stately monument of his fame.
 The architecture of St.
 Sophia, which is now converted into the principal mosch, has been imitated by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultans, and that venerable pile continues to excite the fond admiration of the Greeks, and the more rational curiosity of <NORP>European</NORP> travellers.
 Description.
 The eye of the spectator is disappointed by an irregular prospect of half-domes and shelving roofs: the western front, the principal approach, is destitute of simplicity and magnificence; and the scale of dimensions has been much surpassed by several of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> cathedrals.
 But the architect who <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> erected and aerial cupola, is entitled to the praise of bold design and skilful execution.
 The dome of St.
 Sophia, illuminated by <CARDINAL>four-and-twenty</CARDINAL> windows, is formed with so small a curve, that the depth is equal only to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> sixth of its diameter; the measure of that diameter is <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifteen feet, and the lofty centre, where a crescent has supplanted the cross, rises to the perpendicular height of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty feet above the pavement.
 The circle which encompasses the dome, lightly reposes on <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> strong arches, and their weight is firmly supported by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> massy piles, whose strength is assisted, on the northern and southern sides, by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> columns of <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> granite.
 A <NORP>Greek</NORP> cross, inscribed in a quadrangle, represents the form of the edifice; the exact breadth is <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and forty-three feet, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-nine may be assigned for the extreme length from the sanctuary in the east, to the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> western doors, which open into the vestibule, and from thence into the narthex or exterior portico.
 That portico was the humble station of the penitents.
 The nave or body of the church was filled by the congregation of the faithful; but the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sexes were prudently distinguished, and the upper and lower galleries were allotted for the more private devotion of the women.
 Beyond the northern and southern piles, a balustrade, terminated on either side by the thrones of the emperor and the patriarch, divided the nave from the choir; and the space, as far as the steps of the altar, was occupied by the clergy and singers.
 The altar itself, a name which insensibly became familiar to <NORP>Christian</NORP> ears, was placed in the eastern recess, artificially built in the form of a demi-cylinder; and this sanctuary communicated by several doors with the sacristy, the vestry, the baptistery, and the contiguous buildings, subservient either to the pomp of worship, or the private use of the ecclesiastical ministers.
 The memory of past calamities inspired <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> with a wise resolution, that no wood, except for the doors, should be admitted into the new edifice; and the choice of the materials was applied to the strength, the lightness, or the splendour of the respective parts.
 The solid piles which contained the cupola were composed of huge blocks of freestone, hewn into squares and triangles, fortified by circles of iron, and firmly cemented by the infusion of lead and quicklime: but the weight of the cupola was diminished by the levity of its substance, which consists either of pumice-stone that floats in the water, or of bricks from the Isle of Rhodes, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times less ponderous than the ordinary sort.
 The whole frame of the edifice was constructed of brick; but those base materials were concealed by a crust of marble; and the inside of St.
 Sophia, the cupola, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> larger, and the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> smaller, semi-domes, the walls, the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> columns, and the pavement, delight even the eyes of Barbarians, with a rich and variegated picture.
 A poet, (105) who beheld the primitive lustre of St.
 Sophia, enumerates the Marbles colours, the shades, and the spots of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> marbles, jaspers, and porphyries, which nature had profusely diversified, and which were blended and contrasted as it were by a skilful painter.
 The triumph of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was adorned with the last spoils of Paganism, but the greater part of these costly stones was extracted from the quarries of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, the isles and continent of Greece, Egypt, Africa, and Gaul.
 <CARDINAL>Eight</CARDINAL> columns of porphyry, which <NORP>Aurelian</NORP> had placed in the temple of the sun, were offered by the piety of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> matron; <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> others of green marble were presented by the ambitious zeal of the magistrates of Ephesus: both are admirable by their size and beauty, but every order of architecture disclaims their fantastic capital.
 A variety of ornaments and figures was curiously expressed in mosaic; and the images of Christ, of the Virgin, of saints, and of angels, which have been defaced by <NORP>Turkish</NORP> fanaticism, were dangerously exposed to the superstition of the Greeks.
 According to the sanctity of each object, the precious metals were distributed in thin leaves or in solid masses.
 The balustrade of the choir, the capitals of the pillars, the ornaments of the doors and galleries, were of gilt bronze; the spectator was dazzled by the glittering aspect of the cupola; the sanctuary contained <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of silver; and the holy vases and vestments of the altar were of the purest gold, enriched with inestimable gems.
 Before the structure of the church had arisen <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> cubits above the ground, Riches forty-five <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds were already consumed; and the whole expense amounted to <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand: each reader, according to the measure of his belief, may estimate their value either in gold or silver; but the sum of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> million sterling is the result of the lowest computation.
 A magnificent temple is a laudable monument of national taste and religion; and the enthusiast who entered the dome of St.
 <GPE>Sophia</GPE> might be tempted to suppose that it was the residence, or even the workmanship, of the Deity.
 Yet how dull is the artifice, how insignificant is the labour, if it be compared with the formation of the vilest insect that crawls upon the surface of the temple! Churches and palaces.
 So minute a description of an edifice which time has respected, may attest the truth, and excuse the relation, of the innumerable works, both in the capital and provinces, which <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> constructed on a smaller scale and less durable foundations.
 (106) In <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> alone and the adjacent suburbs, he dedicated <CARDINAL>twenty-five</CARDINAL> churches to the honour of Christ, the Virgin, and the saints: most of these churches were decorated with marble and gold; and their various situation was skilfully chosen in a populous square, or a pleasant grove; on the margin of the sea-shore, or on some lofty eminence which overlooked the continents of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia.
 The church of the Holy Apostles at Constantinople, and that of St.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> at Ephesus, appear to have been framed on the same model: their domes aspired to imitate the cupolas of St.
 Sophia; but the altar was more judiciously placed under the centre of the dome, at the junction of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> stately porticos, which more accurately expressed the figure of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> cross.
 The <PERSON>Virgin</PERSON> of Jerusalem might exult in the temple erected by her <NORP>Imperial</NORP> votary on a most ungrateful spot, which afforded neither ground nor materials to the architect.
 A level was formed by raising part of a deep valley to the height of the mountain.
 The stones of a neighbouring quarry were hewn into regular forms; each block was fixed on a peculiar carriage, drawn by <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> of the strongest oxen, and the roads were widened for the passage of such enormous weights.
 <GPE>Lebanon</GPE> furnished her loftiest cedars for the timbers of the church; and the seasonable discovery of a vein of red marble supplied its beautiful columns, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of which, the supporters of the exterior portico, were esteemed the largest in the world.
 The pious munificence of the emperor was diffused over the Holy Land; and if reason should condemn the monasteries of both sexes which were built or restored by Justinian, yet charity must applaud the wells which he sunk, and the hospitals which he founded, for the relief of the weary pilgrims.
 The schismatical temper of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> was ill entitled to the royal bounty; but in <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Africa, some remedies were applied to the disasters of wars and earthquakes, and both <GPE>Carthage</GPE> and Antioch, emerging from their ruins, might revere the name of their gracious benefactor.
 (107) Almost every saint in the calendar acquired the honours of a temple; almost every city of the empire obtained the solid advantages of bridges, hospitals, and aqueducts; but the severe liberality of the monarch disdained to indulge his subjects in the popular luxury of baths and theatres.
 While <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> laboured for the public service, he was not unmindful of his own dignity and ease.
 The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace, which had been damaged by the conflagration, was restored with new magnificence; and some notion may be conceived of the whole edifice, by the vestibule or hall, which, from the doors perhaps, or the roof, was surnamed chalce, or the brazen.
 The dome of a spacious quadrangle was supported by massy pillars; the pavement and walls were incrusted with many-colored marbles — the emerald green of Laconia, the fiery red, and the white <NORP>Phrygian</NORP> stone, intersected with veins of a sea-green hue: the mosaic paintings of the dome and sides represented the glories of the <NORP>African</NORP> and <NORP>Italian</NORP> triumphs.
 On the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore of the Propontis, at a small distance to the east of Chalcedon, the costly palace and gardens of <GPE>Heraeum</GPE> (108) were prepared for the summer residence of Justinian, and more especially of Theodora.
 The poets of the age have celebrated the rare alliance of nature and art, the harmony of the nymphs of the groves, the fountains, and the waves: yet the crowd of attendants who followed the court complained of their inconvenient lodgings, (109) and the nymphs were too often alarmed by the famous Porphyrio, a whale of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> cubits in breadth, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> in length, who was stranded at the mouth of the River Sangaris, after he had infested more than <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> a century the seas of Constantinople.
 (110) The fortifications of Europe.
 The fortifications of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> were multiplied by Justinian; but the repetition of those timid and fruitless precautions exposes, to a philosophic eye, the debility of the empire.
 (111) From <GPE>Belgrade</GPE> to the Euxine, from the conflux of the Save to the mouth of the Danube, a chain of above fourscore fortified places was extended along the banks of the great river.
 Single watch-towers were changed into spacious citadels; vacant walls, which the engineers contracted or enlarged according to the nature of the ground, were filled with colonies or garrisons; a strong fortress defended the ruins of Trajan's bridge, (112) and several military stations affected to spread beyond the <LOC>Danube</LOC> the pride of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name.
 But that name was divested of its terrors; the Barbarians, in their <DATE>annual</DATE> inroads, passed, and contemptuously repassed, before these useless bulwarks; and the inhabitants of the frontier, instead of reposing under the shadow of the general defence, were compelled to guard, with incessant vigilance, their separate habitations.
 The solitude of ancient cities, was replenished; the new foundations of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> acquired, perhaps too hastily, the epithets of impregnable and populous; and the auspicious place of his own nativity attracted the grateful reverence of the vainest of princes.
 Under the name of <NORP>Justiniana</NORP> prima, the obscure village of <GPE>Tauresium</GPE> became the seat of an archbishop and a praefect, whose jurisdiction extended over <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> warlike provinces of Illyricum; (113) and the corrupt apellation of <GPE>Giustendil</GPE> still indicates, about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> miles to the south of Sophia, the residence of a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sanjak.
 (114) For the use of the emperor's countryman, a cathedral, a place, and an aqueduct, were speedily constructed; the public and private edifices were adapted to the greatness of a royal city; and the strength of the walls resisted, during the lifetime of Justinian, the unskilful assaults of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> and Sclavonians.
 Their progress was sometimes retarded, and their hopes of rapine were disappointed, by the innumerable castles which, in the provinces of Dacia, Epirus, Thessaly, Macedonia, and Thrace, appeared to cover the whole face of the country.
 Six <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of these forts were built or repaired by the emperor; but it seems reasonable to believe, that the far greater part consisted only of a stone or brick tower, in the midst of a square or circular area, which was surrounded by a wall and ditch, and afforded in a moment of danger some protection to the peasants and cattle of the neighbouring villages.
 (115) Yet these military works, which exhausted the public treasure, could not remove the just apprehensions of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and his <NORP>European</NORP> subjects.
 The warm baths of <LOC>Anchialus</LOC> in <LOC>Thrace</LOC> were rendered as safe as they were salutary; but the rich pastures of <GPE>Thessalonica</GPE> were foraged by the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> cavalry; the delicious vale of Tempe, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles from the Danube, was continually alarmed by the sound of war; (116) and no unfortified spot, however distant or solitary, could securely enjoy the blessings of peace.
 The Straits of Thermopylae, which seemed to protect, but which had so often betrayed, the safety of Greece, were diligently strengthened by the labours of Justinian.
 From the edge of the sea-shore, through the forests and valleys, and as far as the summit of the Thessalian mountains, a strong wall was continued, which occupied every practicable entrance.
 Instead of a hasty crowd of peasants, a garrison of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers was stationed along the rampart; granaries of corn and reservoirs of water were provided for their use; and by a precaution that inspired the cowardice which it foresaw, convenient fortresses were erected for their retreat.
 The walls of Corinth, overthrown by an earthquake, and the mouldering bulwarks of <GPE>Athens</GPE> and Plataea, were carefully restored; the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were discouraged by the prospect of successive and painful sieges: and the naked cities of <GPE>Peloponnesus</GPE> were covered by the fortifications of the <LOC>Isthmus</LOC> of Corinth.
 At the extremity of Europe, another peninsula, the Thracian Chersonesus, runs <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days' journey into the sea, to form, with the adjacent shores of Asia, the Straits of the Hellespont.
 The intervals between <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> populous towns were filled by lofty woods, fair pastures, and arable lands; and the isthmus, of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> stadia or furlongs, had been fortified by a <NORP>Spartan</NORP> general <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years before the reign of Justinian.
 (117) In an age of freedom and valor, the slightest rampart may prevent a surprise; and <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> appears insensible of the superiority of ancient times, while he praises the solid construction and double parapet of a wall, whose long arms stretched on either side into the sea; but whose strength was deemed insufficient to guard the Chersonesus, if each city, and particularly <GPE>Gallipoli</GPE> and Sestus, had not been secured by their peculiar fortifications.
 The long wall, as it was emphatically styled, was a work as disgraceful in the object, as it was respectable in the execution.
 The riches of a capital diffuse themselves over the neighbouring country, and the territory of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> a paradise of nature, was adorned with the luxurious gardens and villas of the senators and opulent citizens.
 But their wealth served only to attract the bold and rapacious Barbarians; the noblest of the Romans, in the bosom of peaceful indolence, were led away into <NORP>Scythian</NORP> captivity, and their sovereign might view from his palace the hostile flames which were insolently spread to the gates of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 At the distance only of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> miles, <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> was constrained to establish a last frontier; his long wall, of sixty miles from the <NORP>Propontis</NORP> to the Euxine, proclaimed the impotence of his arms; and as the danger became more imminent, new fortifications were added by the indefatigable prudence of Justinian.
 (118) Security of Asia, after the conquest of Isauria.
 <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, after the submission of the Isaurians, (119) remained without enemies and without fortifications.
 Those bold savages, who had disdained to be the subjects of Gallienus, persisted <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years in a life of independence and rapine.
 The most successful princes respected the strength of the mountains and the despair of the natives; their fierce spirit was sometimes soothed with gifts, and sometimes restrained by terror; and a military count, with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> legions, fixed his permanent and ignominious station in the heart of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces.
 (120) But no sooner was the vigilance of power relaxed or diverted, than the light-armed squadrons descended from the hills, and invaded the peaceful plenty of Asia.
 Although the <NORP>Isaurians</NORP> were not remarkable for stature or bravery, want rendered them bold, and experience made them skilful in the exercise of predatory war.
 They advanced with secrecy and speed to the attack of villages and defenceless towns; their flying parties have sometimes touched the Hellespont, the Euxine, and the gates of Tarsus, Antioch, or Damascus; (121) and the spoil was lodged in their inaccessible mountains, before the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops had received their orders, or the distant province had computed its loss.
 The guilt of rebellion and robbery excluded them from the rights of national enemies; and the magistrates were instructed, by an edict, that the trial or punishment of an Isaurian, even on the festival of Easter, was a meritorious act of justice and piety.
 (122) If the captives were condemned to domestic slavery, they maintained, with their sword or dagger, the private quarrel of their masters; and it was found expedient for the public tranquillity to prohibit the service of such dangerous retainers.
 When their countryman <PERSON>Tarcalissaeus</PERSON> or <PERSON>Zeno</PERSON> ascended the throne, he invited a faithful and formidable band of Isaurians, who insulted the court and city, and were rewarded by an <DATE>annual</DATE> tribute of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold.
 But the hopes of fortune depopulated the mountains, luxury enervated the hardiness of their minds and bodies, and in proportion as they mixed with mankind, they became less qualified for the enjoyment of poor and solitary freedom.
 After the death of Zeno, his successor <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> suppressed their pensions, exposed their persons to the revenge of the people, banished them from Constantinople, and prepared to sustain a war, which left only the alternative of victory or servitude.
 A brother of the last emperor usurped the title of Augustus; his cause was powerfully supported by the arms, the treasures, and the magazines, collected by Zeno; and the native <NORP>Isaurians</NORP> must have formed the smallest portion of the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> under his standard, which was sanctified, for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time, by the presence of a fighting bishop.

 492-498.
 Their disorderly numbers were vanquished in the plains of <LOC>Phrygia</LOC> by the valour and discipline of the Goths; but a war of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years almost exhausted the courage of the emperor.
 (123) The <NORP>Isaurians</NORP> retired to their mountains; their fortresses were successively besieged and ruined; their communication with the sea was intercepted; the bravest of their leaders died in arms; the surviving chiefs, before their execution, were dragged in chains through the hippodrome; a colony of their youth was transplanted into Thrace, and the remnant of the people submitted to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 Yet some generations elapsed before their minds were reduced to the level of slavery.
 The populous villages of Mount Taurus were filled with horsemen and archers: they resisted the imposition of tributes, but they recruited the armies of Justinian; and his civil magistrates, the proconsul of Cappadocia, the count of Isauria, and the praetors of <GPE>Lycaonia</GPE> and Pisidia, were invested with military power to restrain the licentious practice of rapes and assassinations.
 (124) Fortifications of the empire, from the <LOC>Euxine</LOC> to the <NORP>Persian</NORP> frontier.
 If we extend our view from the tropic to the mouth of the Tanais, we may observe, on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hand, the precautions of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> to curb the savages of Aethiopia, (125) and on the other, the long walls which he constructed in <GPE>Crimaea</GPE> for the protection of his friendly Goths, a colony of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> shepherds and warriors.
 (126) From that peninsula to Trebizond, the eastern curve of the <LOC>Euxine</LOC> was secured by forts, by alliance, or by religion; and the possession of Lazica, the <GPE>Colchos</GPE> of ancient, the <NORP>Mingrelia</NORP> of modern, geography, soon became the object of an important war.
 Trebizond, in after- times the seat of a romantic empire, was indebted to the liberality of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> for a church, an aqueduct, and a castle, whose ditches are hewn in the solid rock.
 From that maritime city, frontier line of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles may be drawn to the fortress of Circesium, the last <NORP>Roman</NORP> station on the Euphrates.
 (127) Above <PERSON>Trebizond</PERSON> immediately, and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> days' journey to the south, the country rises into dark forests and craggy mountains, as savage though not so lofty as the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and the Pyrenees.
 In this rigorous climate, (128) where the snows seldom melt, the fruits are tardy and tasteless, even honey is poisonous: the most industrious tillage would be confined to some pleasant valleys; and the pastoral tribes obtained a scanty sustenance from the flesh and milk of their cattle.
 The <PERSON>Chalybians</PERSON> (129) derived their name and temper from the iron quality of the soil; and, since the days of Cyrus, they might produce, under the various appellations of Cha daeans and Zanians, an uninterrupted prescription of war and rapine.
 Under the reign of Justinian, they acknowledged the god and the emperor of the Romans, and <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> fortresses were built in the most accessible passages, to exclude the ambition of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch.
 (130) The principal source of the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> descends from the Chalybian mountains, and seems to flow towards the west and the Euxine: bending to the south-west, the river passes under the walls of <GPE>Satala</GPE> and Melitene, (which were restored by <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> as the bulwarks of the Lesser Armenia,) and gradually approaches the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> Sea; till at length, repelled by Mount Taurus, (131) the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> inclines its long and flexible course to the south-east and the Gulf of Persia.
 Among the <NORP>Roman</NORP> cities beyond the Euphrates, we distinguish <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> recent foundations, which were named from Theodosius, and the relics of the martyrs; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> capitals, <GPE>Amida</GPE> and Edessa, which are celebrated in the history of every age.
 Their strength was proportioned by <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> to the danger of their situation.
 A ditch and palisade might be sufficient to resist the artless force of the cavalry of Scythia; but more elaborate works were required to sustain a regular siege against the arms and treasures of the great king.
 His skilful engineers understood the methods of conducting deep mines, and of raising platforms to the level of the rampart: he shook the strongest battlements with his military engines, and sometimes advanced to the assault with a line of movable turrets on the backs of elephants.
 In the great cities of the East, the disadvantage of space, perhaps of position, was compensated by the zeal of the people, who seconded the garrison in the defence of their country and religion; and the fabulous promise of the Son of God, that <PERSON>Edessa</PERSON> should never be taken, filled the citizens with valiant confidence, and chilled the besiegers with doubt and dismay.
 (132) The subordinate towns of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and <LOC>Mesopotamia</LOC> were diligently strengthened, and the posts which appeared to have any command of ground or water were occupied by numerous forts, substantially built of stone, or more hastily erected with the obvious materials of earth and brick.
 The eye of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> investigated every spot; and his cruel precautions might attract the war into some lonely vale, whose peaceful natives, connected by trade and marriage, were ignorant of national discord and the quarrels of princes.
 Westward of the Euphrates, a sandy desert extends above <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles to the Red Sea.
 Nature had interposed a vacant solitude between the ambition of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rival empires; the Arabians, till <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> arose, were formidable only as robbers; and in the proud security of peace the fortifications of <GPE>Syria</GPE> were neglected on the most vulnerable side.
 Death of Perozes, king of Persia.
 A.
D.
 488.
 But the national enmity, at least the effects of that enmity, had been suspended by a truce, which continued above fourscore years.
 An ambassador from the emperor <PERSON>Zeno</PERSON> accompanied the rash and unfortunate Perozes, in his expedition against the Nepthalites, or white Huns, whose conquests had been stretched from the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> to the heart of India, whose throne was enriched with emeralds, (133) and whose cavalry was supported by a line of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> elephants.
 (134) The <NORP>Persians</NORP> were twice circumvented, in a situation which made valor useless and flight impossible; and the double victory of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> was achieved by military stratagem.
 They dismissed their royal captive after he had submitted to adore the majesty of a Barbarian; and the humiliation was poorly evaded by the casuistical subtlety of the Magi, who instructed <PERSON>Perozes</PERSON> to direct his attention to the rising sun.
 ! The indignant successor of <PERSON>Cyrus</PERSON> forgot his danger and his gratitude; he renewed the attack with headstrong fury, and lost both his army and his life.
 (135) The death of <PERSON>Perozes</PERSON> abandoned <GPE>Persia</GPE> to her foreign and domestic enemies; !! and <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years of confusion elapsed before his son Cabades, or Kobad, could embrace any designs of ambition or revenge.
 The <NORP>Persian</NORP> war, A.
D.
 502-505.
 The unkind parsimony of <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> was the motive or pretence of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> war; (136) the <NORP>Huns</NORP> and <NORP>Arabs</NORP> marched under the <NORP>Persian</NORP> standard, and the fortifications of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and <LOC>Mesopotamia</LOC> were, at that time, in a ruinous or imperfect condition.
 The emperor returned his thanks to the governor and people of <GPE>Martyropolis</GPE> for the prompt surrender of a city which could not be successfully defended, and the conflagration of <ORG>Theodosiopolis</ORG> might justify the conduct of their prudent neighbors.
 <GPE>Amida</GPE> sustained a long and destructive siege: at the end of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months the loss of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the soldiers of <ORG>Cabades</ORG> was not balanced by any prospect of success, and it was in vain that the <PERSON>Magi</PERSON> deduced a flattering prediction from the indecency of the women on the ramparts, who had revealed their most secret charms to the eyes of the assailants.
 At length, in a silent night, they ascended the most accessible tower, which was guarded only by some monks, oppressed, after the duties of a festival, with sleep and wine.
 Scaling-ladders were applied at the dawn of day; the presence of Cabades, his stern command, and his drawn sword, compelled the <NORP>Persians</NORP> to vanquish; and before it was sheathed, fourscore <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants had expiated the blood of their companions.
 After the siege of Amida, the war continued <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, and the unhappy frontier tasted the full measure of its calamities.
 The gold of <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> was offered too late, the number of his troops was defeated by the number of their generals; the country was stripped of its inhabitants, and both the living and the dead were abandoned to the wild beasts of the desert.
 The resistance of Edessa, and the deficiency of spoil, inclined the mind of <ORG>Cabades</ORG> to peace: he sold his conquests for an exorbitant price; and the same line, though marked with slaughter and devastation, still separated the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires.
 To avert the repetition of the same evils, <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> resolved to found a new colony, so strong, that it should defy the power of the Persian, so far advanced towards Assyria, that its stationary troops might defend the province by the menace or operation of offensive war.
 Fortifications of Dara.
 For this purpose, the town of Dara, (137) fourteen miles from Nisibis, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> days' journey from the Tigris, was peopled and adorned; the hasty works of <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> were improved by the perseverance of Justinian; and, without insisting on places less important, the fortifications of <PERSON>Dara</PERSON> may represent the military architecture of the age.
 The city was surrounded with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> walls, and the interval between them, of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> paces, afforded a retreat to the cattle of the besieged.
 The inner wall was a monument of strength and beauty: it measured sixty feet from the ground, and the height of the towers was <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> feet; the loopholes, from whence an enemy might be annoyed with missile weapons, were small, but numerous; the soldiers were planted along the rampart, under the shelter of double galleries, and a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> platform, spacious and secure, was raised on the summit of the towers.
 The exterior wall appears to have been less lofty, but more solid; and each tower was protected by a quadrangular bulwark.
 A hard, rocky soil resisted the tools of the miners, and on the south-east, where the ground was more tractable, their approach was retarded by a new work, which advanced in the shape of a half-moon.
 The double and treble ditches were filled with a stream of water; and in the management of the river, the most skilful labor was employed to supply the inhabitants, to distress the besiegers, and to prevent the mischiefs of a natural or artificial inundation.
 <PERSON>Dara</PERSON> continued more than sixty years to fulfil the wishes of its founders, and to provoke the jealousy of the Persians, who incessantly complained, that this impregnable fortress had been constructed in manifest violation of the treaty of peace between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires.
 The <LOC>Caspian</LOC> or <NORP>Iberian</NORP> gates.
 Between the <LOC>Euxine</LOC> and the Caspian, the countries of Colchos, Iberia, and Albania, are intersected in every direction by the branches of Mount Caucasus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal gates, or passes, from north to south, have been frequently confounded in the geography both of the ancients and moderns.
 The name of <LOC>Caspian</LOC> or <NORP>Albanian</NORP> gates is properly applied to Derbend, (138) which occupies a short declivity between the mountains and the sea: the city, if we give credit to local tradition, had been founded by the Greeks; and this dangerous entrance was fortified by the kings of <GPE>Persia</GPE> with a mole, double walls, and doors of iron.
 The <NORP>Iberian</NORP> gates (139) are formed by a narrow passage of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> miles in Mount Caucasus, which opens from the northern side of Iberia, or Georgia, into the plain that reaches to the <GPE>Tanais</GPE> and the Volga.
 A fortress, designed by <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> perhaps, or <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his successors, to command that important pass, had descended by right of conquest or inheritance to a prince of the Huns, who offered it for a moderate price to the emperor; but while <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> paused, while he timorously computed the cost and the distance, a more vigilant rival interposed, and <ORG>Cabades</ORG> forcibly occupied the Straits of Caucasus.
 The <NORP>Albanian</NORP> and <NORP>Iberian</NORP> gates excluded the horsemen of <GPE>Scythia</GPE> from the shortest and most practicable roads, and the whole front of the mountains was covered by the rampart of <PERSON>Gog</PERSON> and Magog, the long wall which has excited the curiosity of an <NORP>Arabian</NORP> caliph (140) and a <NORP>Russian</NORP> conqueror.
 (141) According to a recent description, huge stones, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> feet thick, and twenty-one feet in length or height, are artificially joined without iron or cement, to compose a wall, which runs above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles from the shores of Derbend, over the hills, and through the valleys of <GPE>Daghestan</GPE> and Georgia.
 Without a vision, such a work might be undertaken by the policy of Cabades; without a miracle, it might be accomplished by his son, so formidable to the Romans, under the name of Chosroes; so dear to the Orientals, under the appellation of Nushirwan.
 The <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch held in his hand the keys both of peace and war; but he stipulated, in every treaty, that <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> should contribute to the expense of a common barrier, which equally protected the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires from the inroads of the Scythians.
 (142) <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> suppresses the schools of <GPE>Athens</GPE> VI.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> suppressed the schools of <GPE>Athens</GPE> and the consulship of Rome, which had given so many sages and heroes to mankind.
 Both these institutions had long since degenerated from their primitive glory; yet some reproach may be justly inflicted on the avarice and jealousy of a prince, by whose hand such venerable ruins were destroyed.
 The schools of <GPE>Athens</GPE> Athens, after her <NORP>Persian</NORP> triumphs, adopted the philosophy of <GPE>Ionia</GPE> and the rhetoric of Sicily; and these studies became the patrimony of a city, whose inhabitants, about <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> males, condensed, within the period of a single life, the genius of ages and millions.
 Our sense of the dignity of human nature is exalted by the simple recollection, that <PERSON>Isocrates</PERSON> (143) was the companion of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> and Xenophon; that he assisted, perhaps with the historian Thucydides, at the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> representation of the Oedipus of Sophocles and the Iphigenia of Euripides; and that his pupils <PERSON>Aeschines</PERSON> and <PERSON>Demosthenes</PERSON> contended for the crown of patriotism in the presence of Aristotle, the master of Theophrastus, who taught at <GPE>Athens</GPE> with the founders of the <NORP>Stoic</NORP> and <NORP>Epicurean</NORP> sects.
 (144) The ingenuous youth of <GPE>Attica</GPE> enjoyed the benefits of their domestic education, which was communicated without envy to the rival cities.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> disciples heard the lessons of Theophrastus; (145) the schools of rhetoric must have been still more populous than those of philosophy; and a rapid succession of students diffused the fame of their teachers as far as the utmost limits of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> language and name.
 Those limits were enlarged by the victories of Alexander; the arts of <GPE>Athens</GPE> survived her freedom and dominion; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies which the <NORP>Macedonians</NORP> planted in Egypt, and scattered over Asia, undertook long and frequent pilgrimages to worship the Muses in their favorite temple on the banks of the Ilissus.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> conquerors respectfully listened to the instructions of their subjects and captives; the names of <PERSON>Cicero</PERSON> and <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> were enrolled in the schools of Athens; and after the perfect settlement of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, the natives of Italy, of Africa, and of Britain, conversed in the groves of the academy with their fellow-students of the East.
 The studies of philosophy and eloquence are congenial to a popular state, which encourages the freedom of inquiry, and submits only to the force of persuasion.
 In the republics of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Rome, the art of speaking was the powerful engine of patriotism or ambition; and the schools of rhetoric poured forth a colony of statesmen and legislators.
 When the liberty of public debate was suppressed, the orator, in the honorable profession of an advocate, might plead the cause of innocence and justice; he might abuse his talents in the more profitable trade of panegyric; and the same precepts continued to dictate the fanciful declamations of the sophist, and the chaster beauties of historical composition.
 The systems which professed to unfold the nature of God, of man, and of the universe, entertained the curiosity of the philosophic student; and according to the temper of his mind, he might doubt with the Sceptics, or decide with the Stoics, sublimely speculate with Plato, or severely argue with Aristotle.
 The pride of the adverse sects had fixed an unattainable term of moral happiness and perfection; but the race was glorious and salutary; the disciples of Zeno, and even those of Epicurus, were taught both to act and to suffer; and the death of <PERSON>Petronius</PERSON> was not less effectual than that of Seneca, to humble a tyrant by the discovery of his impotence.
 The light of science could not indeed be confined within the walls of Athens.
 Her incomparable writers address themselves to the human race; the living masters emigrated to <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Asia; Berytus, in later times, was devoted to the study of the law; astronomy and physic were cultivated in the musaeum of Alexandria; but the Attic schools of rhetoric and philosophy maintained their superior reputation from the Peloponnesian war to the reign of Justinian.
 Athens, though situate in a barren soil, possessed a pure air, a free navigation, and the monuments of ancient art.
 That sacred retirement was seldom disturbed by the business of trade or government; and the last of the <NORP>Athenians</NORP> were distinguished by their lively wit, the purity of their taste and language, their social manners, and some traces, at least in discourse, of the magnanimity of their fathers.
 In the suburbs of the city, the academy of the Platonists, the lycaeum of the Peripatetics, the portico of the Stoics, and the garden of the Epicureans, were planted with trees and decorated with statues; and the philosophers, instead of being immured in a cloister, delivered their instructions in spacious and pleasant walks, which, at different hours, were consecrated to the exercises of the mind and body.
 The genius of the founders still lived in those venerable seats; the ambition of succeeding to the masters of human reason excited a generous emulation; and the merit of the candidates was determined, on each vacancy, by the free voices of an enlightened people.
 The <NORP>Athenian</NORP> professors were paid by their disciples: according to their mutual wants and abilities, the price appears to have varied; and <PERSON>Isocrates</PERSON> himself, who derides the avarice of the sophists, required, in his school of rhetoric, about <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> pounds from each of his <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pupils.
 The wages of industry are just and honorable, yet the same <PERSON>Isocrates</PERSON> shed tears at the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> receipt of a stipend: the <NORP>Stoic</NORP> might blush when he was hired to preach the contempt of money; and I should be sorry to discover that <PERSON>Aristotle</PERSON> or <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> so far degenerated from the example of Socrates, as to exchange knowledge for gold.
 But some property of lands and houses was settled by the permission of the laws, and the legacies of deceased friends, on the philosophic chairs of Athens.
 <PERSON>Epicurus</PERSON> bequeathed to his disciples the gardens which he had purchased for eighty minae or <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> pounds, with a fund sufficient for their frugal subsistence and <DATE>monthly</DATE> festivals; (146) and the patrimony of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> afforded an <DATE>annual</DATE> rent, which, in <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> centuries, was gradually increased from <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (147) The schools of <GPE>Athens</GPE> were protected by the wisest and most virtuous of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes.
 The library, which <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> founded, was placed in a portico adorned with pictures, statues, and a roof of alabaster, and supported by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> columns of <NORP>Phrygian</NORP> marble.
 The public salaries were assigned by the generous spirit of the Antonines; and each professor of politics, of rhetoric, of the Platonic, the Peripatetic, the Stoic, and the <NORP>Epicurean</NORP> philosophy, received an <DATE>annual</DATE> stipend of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> drachmae, or more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds sterling.
 (148) After the death of Marcus, these liberal donations, and the privileges attached to the thrones of science, were abolished and revived, diminished and enlarged; but some vestige of royal bounty may be found under the successors of Constantine; and their arbitrary choice of an unworthy candidate might tempt the philosophers of <GPE>Athens</GPE> to regret the days of independence and poverty.
 (149) It is remarkable, that the impartial favor of the <PERSON>Antonines</PERSON> was bestowed on the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> adverse sects of philosophy, which they considered as equally useful, or at least, as equally innocent.
 <PERSON>Socrates</PERSON> had formerly been the glory and the reproach of his country; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> lessons of <PERSON>Epicurus</PERSON> so strangely scandalized the pious ears of the Athenians, that by his exile, and that of his antagonists, they silenced all vain disputes concerning the nature of the gods.
 But in the ensuing year they recalled the hasty decree, restored the liberty of the schools, and were convinced by the experience of ages, that the moral character of philosophers is not affected by the diversity of their theological speculations.
 (150) They are suppressed by Justinian.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms were less fatal to the schools of <GPE>Athens</GPE> than the establishment of a new religion, whose ministers superseded the exercise of reason, resolved every question by an article of faith, and condemned the infidel or sceptic to eternal flames.
 In many a volume of laborious controversy, they exposed the weakness of the understanding and the corruption of the heart, insulted human nature in the sages of antiquity, and proscribed the spirit of philosophical inquiry, so repugnant to the doctrine, or at least to the temper, of an humble believer.
 The surviving sects of the Platonists, whom <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> would have blushed to acknowledge, extravagantly mingled a sublime theory with the practice of superstition and magic; and as they remained alone in the midst of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> world, they indulged a secret rancor against the government of the church and state, whose severity was still suspended over their heads.
 Proclus.
 About a century after the reign of Julian, (151) <PERSON>Proclus</PERSON> (152) was permitted to teach in the philosophic chair of the academy; and such was his industry, that he frequently, in the same day, pronounced <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> lessons, and composed <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> lines.
 His sagacious mind explored the deepest questions of morals and metaphysics, and he ventured to urge <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> arguments against the <NORP>Christian</NORP> doctrine of the creation of the world.
 But in the intervals of study, he personally conversed with Pan, Aesculapius, and Minerva, in whose mysteries he was secretly initiated, and whose prostrate statues he adored; in the devout persuasion that the philosopher, who is a citizen of the universe, should be the priest of its various deities.
 An eclipse of the sun announced his approaching end; and his life, with that of his scholar Isidore, (153) compiled by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of their most learned disciples, exhibits a deplorable picture of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> childhood of human reason.
 His successors, A.
D.
 485-529.
 Yet the golden chain, as it was fondly styled, of the <NORP>Platonic</NORP> succession, continued forty-four years from the death of <PERSON>Proclus</PERSON> to the edict of Justinian, (154) which imposed a perpetual silence on the schools of Athens, and excited the grief and indignation of the few remaining votaries of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> science and superstition.
 <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> friends and philosophers, <PERSON>Diogenes</PERSON> and Hermias, <PERSON>Eulalius</PERSON> and Priscian, Damascius, Isidore, and Simplicius, who dissented from the religion of their sovereign, embraced the resolution of seeking in a foreign land the freedom which was denied in their native country.
 They had heard, and they credulously believed, that the republic of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> was realized in the despotic government of Persia, and that a patriot king reigned ever the happiest and most virtuous of nations.
 They were soon astonished by the natural discovery, that <GPE>Persia</GPE> resembled the other countries of the globe; that Chosroes, who affected the name of a philosopher, was vain, cruel, and ambitious; that bigotry, and a spirit of intolerance, prevailed among the Magi; that the nobles were haughty, the courtiers servile, and the magistrates unjust; that the guilty sometimes escaped, and that the innocent were often oppressed.
 The disappointment of the philosophers provoked them to overlook the real virtues of the Persians; and they were scandalized, more deeply perhaps than became their profession, with the plurality of wives and concubines, the incestuous marriages, and the custom of exposing dead bodies to the dogs and vultures, instead of hiding them in the earth, or consuming them with fire.
 Their repentance was expressed by a precipitate return, and they loudly declared that they had rather die on the borders of the empire, than enjoy the wealth and favor of the Barbarian.
 From this journey, however, they derived a benefit which reflects the purest lustre on the character of Chosroes.
 He required, that the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> sages who had visited the court of <GPE>Persia</GPE> should be exempted from the penal laws which <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> enacted against his <NORP>Pagan</NORP> subjects; and this privilege, expressly stipulated in a treaty of peace, was guarded by the vigilance of a powerful mediator.
 (155) The last of the philosophers.
 <PERSON>Simplicius</PERSON> and his companions ended their lives in peace and obscurity; and as they left no disciples, they terminate the long list of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> philosophers, who may be justly praised, notwithstanding their defects, as the wisest and most virtuous of their contemporaries.
 The writings of <PERSON>Simplicius</PERSON> are now extant.
 His physical and metaphysical commentaries on <PERSON>Aristotle</PERSON> have passed away with the fashion of the times; but his moral interpretation of <PERSON>Epictetus</PERSON> is preserved in the library of nations, as a classic book, most excellently adapted to direct the will, to purify the heart, and to confirm the understanding, by a just confidence in the nature both of God and man.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> consulship extinguished by Justinian, A.
D.
 541.
 About the same time that <PERSON>Pythagoras</PERSON> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invented the appellation of philosopher, liberty and the consulship were founded at <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the elder Brutus.
 The revolutions of the consular office, which may be viewed in the successive lights of a substance, a shadow, and a name, have been occasionally mentioned in the present History.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrates of the republic had been chosen by the people, to exercise, in the senate and in the camp, the powers of peace and war, which were afterwards translated to the emperors.
 But the tradition of ancient dignity was long revered by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and Barbarians.
 A <NORP>Gothic</NORP> historian applauds the consulship of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> as the height of all temporal glory and greatness; (156) the king of <GPE>Italy</GPE> himself congratulated those <DATE>annual</DATE> favorites of fortune who, without the cares, enjoyed the splendor of the throne; and at the end of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> consuls were created by the sovereigns of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Constantinople, for the sole purpose of giving a date to the year, and a festival to the people.
 But the expenses of this festival, in which the wealthy and the vain aspired to surpass their predecessors, insensibly arose to the enormous sum of fourscore <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds; the wisest senators declined a useless honor, which involved the certain ruin of their families, and to this reluctance I should impute the frequent chasms in the last age of the consular Fasti.
 The predecessors of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> had assisted from the public treasures the dignity of the less opulent candidates; the avarice of that prince preferred the cheaper and more convenient method of advice and regulation.
 (157) <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> processions or spectacles were the number to which his edict confined the horse and chariot races, the athletic sports, the music, and pantomimes of the theatre, and the hunting of wild beasts; and small pieces of silver were discreetly substituted to the gold medals, which had always excited tumult and drunkenness, when they were scattered with a profuse hand among the populace.
 Notwithstanding these precautions, and his own example, the succession of consuls finally ceased in the thirteenth year of Justinian, whose despotic temper might be gratified by the silent extinction of a title which admonished the <NORP>Romans</NORP> of their ancient freedom.
 (158) Yet the <DATE>annual</DATE> consulship still lived in the minds of the people; they fondly expected its speedy restoration; they applauded the gracious condescension of successive princes, by whom it was assumed in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> year of their reign; and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> centuries elapsed, after the death of Justinian, before that obsolete dignity, which had been suppressed by custom, could be abolished by law.
 (159) The imperfect mode of distinguishing each year by the name of a magistrate, was usefully supplied by the date of a permanent aera: the creation of the world, according to the <WORK_OF_ART>Septuagint</WORK_OF_ART> version, was adopted by the Greeks; (160) and the Latins, since the age of Charlemagne, have computed their time from the birth of Christ.
