Of the <LAW>Constitution</LAW> of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> Empire in the Age of the <PERSON>Antonines</PERSON> Idea of a monarchy.
 THE obvious definition of a monarchy seems to be that of a state, in which a single person, by whatsoever name he may be distinguished, is entrusted with the execution of the laws, the management of the revenue, and the command of the army.
 But, unless public liberty is protected by intrepid and vigilant guardians, the authority of so formidable a magistrate will soon degenerate into despotism.
 The influence of the clergy, in an age of superstition, might be usefully employed to assert the rights of mankind; but so intimate is the connection between the throne and the altar, that the banner of the church has very seldom been seen on the side of the people.
 A martial nobility and stubborn commons, possessed of arms, tenacious of property, and collected into constitutional assemblies, form the only balance capable of preserving a free constitution against enterprises of an aspiring prince.
 Situation of Augustus.
 Every barrier of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution had been levelled by the vast ambition of the dictator; every fence had been extirpated by the cruel hand of the Triumvir.
 After the victory of Actium, the fate of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world depended on the will of Octavianus, surnamed Caesar, by his uncle's adoption, and afterwards Augustus, by the flattery of the senate.
 The conqueror was at the head of <CARDINAL>forty-four</CARDINAL> veteran legions, (1) conscious of their own strength, and of the weakness of the constitution, habituated, during twenty <DATE>years</DATE> civil war, to every act of blood and violence, and passionately devoted to the house of Caesar, from whence alone they had received, and expected, the most lavish rewards.
 The provinces, long oppressed by the ministers of the republic, sighed for the government of a single person, who would be the master, not the accomplice, of those petty tyrants.
 The people of Rome, viewing, with a secret pleasure, the humiliation of the aristocracy, demanded only bread and public shows; and were supplied with both by the liberal hand of Augustus.
 The rich and polite Italians, who had almost universally embraced the philosophy of Epicurus, enjoyed the present blessings of ease and tranquillity, and suffered not the pleasing dream to be interrupted by the memory of their old tumultuous freedom.
 With its power, the senate had lost its dignity; many of the most noble families were extinct.
 The <NORP>republicans</NORP> of spirit and ability had perished in the field of battle, or in the proscription.
 The door of the assembly had been designedly left open, for a mixed multitude of more than a thousand persons, who reflected disgrace upon their rank, instead of deriving honour from it.
 (2) He reforms the senate.
 The reformation of the senate was <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps in which <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> laid aside the tyrant, and professed himself the father of his country.
 He was elected censor; and, in concert with his faithful Agrippa, he examined the list of the senators, expelled a few members, whose vices or whose obstinacy required a public example, persuaded near <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred to prevent the shame of an expulsion by a voluntary retreat, raised the qualification of a senator to about <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand pounds, created a sufficient number of <NORP>Patrician</NORP> families, and accepted for himself the honourable title of Prince of the Senate, which had always been bestowed, by the censors, on the citizen the most eminent for his honours and services.
 (3) But whilst he thus restored the dignity, he destroyed the independence of the senate.
 The principles of a free constitution are irrevocably lost, when the legislative power is nominated by the executive.
 Resigns his usurped powers.
 Before an assembly thus modelled and prepared, <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> pronounced a studied oration, which displayed his patriotism, and disguised his ambition.
 Is prevailed upon to resume it under the title of Emperor or General.
 It would require the pen of <NORP>Tacitus</NORP> (if <NORP>Tacitus</NORP> had assisted at this assembly) to describe the various emotions of the senate; those that were suppressed, and those that were affected.
 It was dangerous to trust the sincerity of Augustus; to seem to distrust it was still more dangerous.
 The respective advantages of monarchy and a republic have often divided speculative inquirers; the present greatness of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> state, the corruption of manners, and the licence of the soldiers, supplied new arguments to the advocates of monarchy; and these general views of government were again warped by the hopes and fears of each individual.
 Amidst this confusion of sentiments, the answer of the senate was unanimous and decisive.
 They refused to accept the resignation of Augustus; they conjured him not to desert the republic, which he had saved.
 After a decent resistance, the crafty tyrant submitted to the orders of the senate; and consented to receive the government of the provinces, and the general command of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies, under the well-known names of <ORG>PROCONSUL</ORG> and IMPERATOR.
 (5) But he would receive them only for <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years.
 Even before the expiration of that period, he hoped that the wounds of civil discord would be completely healed, and that the republic, restored to its pristine health and vigour, would no longer require the dangerous interposition of so extraordinary a magistrate.
 The memory of this comedy, repeated several times during the life of Augustus, was preserved to the last ages of the empire, by the peculiar pomp with which the perpetual monarchs of <GPE>Rome</GPE> always solemnised the tenth <DATE>years</DATE> of their reign.
 (6) Power of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals.
 Without any violation of the principles of the constitution, the general of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies might receive and exercise an authority almost despotic over the soldiers, the enemies, and the subjects of the republic.
 With regard to the soldiers, the jealousy of freedom had, even from the earliest ages of Rome, given way to the hopes of conquest, and a just sense of military discipline.
 The dictator, or consul, had a right to command the service of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> youth; and to punish an obstinate or cowardly disobedience by the most severe and ignominious penalties, by striking the offender out of the list of citizens, by confiscating his property, and by selling his person into slavery.
 (7) The most sacred rights of freedom, confirmed by the <NORP>Porcian</NORP> and <NORP>Sempronian</NORP> laws, were suspended by the military engagement.
 In his camp the general exercised an absolute power of life and death; his jurisdiction was not confined by any forms of trial or rules of proceeding, and the execution of the sentence was immediate and without appeal.
 (8) The choice of the enemies of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was regularly decided by the legislative authority.
 The most important resolutions of peace and war were seriously debated in the senate, and solemnly ratified by the people.
 But when the arms of the legions were carried to a great distance from Italy, the generals assumed the liberty of directing them against whatever people, and in whatever manner, they judged most advantageous for the public service.
 It was from the success, not from the justice, of their enterprises, that they expected the honours of a triumph.
 In the use of victory, especially after they were no longer controlled by the commissioners of the senate, they exercised the most unbounded despotism.
 When <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> commanded in the East, he rewarded his soldiers and allies, dethroned princes, divided kingdoms, founded colonies, and distributed the treasures of Mithridates.
 On his return to Rome, he obtained, by a single act of the senate and people, the universal ratification of all his proceedings.
 (9) Such was the power over the soldiers, and over the enemies of Rome, which was either granted to, or assumed by, the generals of the republic.
 They were, at the same time, the governors, or rather monarchs, of the conquered provinces, united the civil with the military character, administered justice as well as the finances, and exercised both the executive and legislative power of the state.
 Lieutenants of the emperor.
 From what has been already observed in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> chapter of this work, some notion may be formed of the armies and provinces thus intrusted to the ruling hand of Augustus.
 But as it was impossible that he could personally command the legions of so many distant frontiers, he was indulged by the senate, as <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had already been, in the permission of devolving the execution of his great office on a sufficient number of lieutenants.
 In rank and authority these officers seemed not inferior to the ancient pro-consuls; but their station was dependent and precarious.
 They received and held their commissions at the will of a superior, to whose auspicious influence the merit of their action was legally attributed.
 (10) They were the representatives of the emperor.
 The emperor alone was the general of the republic, and his jurisdiction, civil as well as military, extended over all the conquests of Rome.
 It was some satisfaction, however, to the senate, that he always delegated his power to the members of their body.
 The <NORP>Imperial</NORP> lieutenants were of consular or praetorian dignity; the legions were commanded by senators, and the praefecture of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> was the only important trust committed to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> knight.
 Division of the provinces between the emperor and the senate.
 Within six days after <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> had been compelled to accept so very liberal a grant, he resolved to gratify the pride of the senate by an easy sacrifice.
 He represented to them, that they had enlarged his powers, even beyond that degree which might be required by the melancholy condition of the times.
 They had not permitted him to refuse the laborious command of the armies and the frontiers; but he must insist on being allowed to restore the more peaceful and secure provinces, to the mild administration of the civil magistrate.
 In the division of the provinces, <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> provided for his own power, and for the dignity of the republic.
 The proconsuls of the senate, particularly those of Asia, Greece, and Africa, enjoyed a more honourable character than the lieutenants of the emperor, who commanded in <LOC>Gaul</LOC> or Syria.
 The former were attended by lictors, the latter by soldiers.
 A law was passed that wherever the emperor was present, his extraordinary commission should supersede the ordinary jurisdiction of the governor; a custom was introduced, that the new conquest belonged to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> portion; and it was soon discovered that the authority of the Prince, the favourite epithet of Augustus, was the same in every part of the empire.
 The former preserves his military command, and guards <GPE>Rome</GPE> itself .
 In return for this imaginary concession, <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> obtained an important privilege, which rendered him master of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy.
 By a dangerous exception to the ancient maxims, he was authorised to preserve his military command, supported by a numerous body of guards, even in time of peace, and in the heart of the capital.
 His command, indeed, was confined to those citizens who were engaged in the service by the military oath; but such was the propensity of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to servitude, that the oath was voluntarily taken by the magistrates, the senators, and the equestrian order, till the homage of flattery was insensibly converted into an annual and solemn protestation of fidelity.
 Consular and tribunitian powers.
 Although <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> considered a military force as the firmest foundation, he wisely rejected it, as a very odious instrument of government.
 It was more agreeable to his temper, as well as to his policy, to reign under the venerable names of ancient magistracy, and artfully to collect, in his own person, all the scattered rays of civil jurisdiction.
 With this view, he permitted the senate to confer upon him, for his life, the powers of the consular (11) and tribunitian offices, (12) which were, in the same manner, continued to all his successors.
 The consuls had succeeded to the kings of Rome, and represented the dignity of the state.
 They superintended the ceremonies of religion, levied and commanded the legions, gave audience to foreign ambassadors, and presided in the assemblies both of the senate and people.
 The general control of the finances was intrusted to their care; and though they seldom had leisure to administer justice in person, they were considered as the supreme guardians of law, equity, and the public peace.
 Such was their ordinary jurisdiction; but whenever the senate empowered the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate to consult the safety of the commonwealth, he was raised by that decree above the laws, and exercised, in the defence of liberty, a temporary despotism (13).
 The character of the tribunes was, in every respect, different from that of the consuls.
 The appearance of the former was modest and humble but their persons were sacred and inviolable.
 Their force was suited rather for opposition than for action.
 They were instituted to defend the oppressed, to pardon offences, to arraign the enemies of the people, and, when they judged it necessary, to stop, by a single word, the whole machine of government.
 As long as the republic subsisted, the dangerous influence, which either the consul or the tribune might derive from their respective jurisdiction, was diminished by several important restrictions.
 Their authority expired with the year in which they were elected; the former office was divided between two, the latter among <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> persons; and, as both in their private and public interest they were averse to each other, their mutual conflicts contributed, for the most part, to strengthen rather than to destroy the balance of the constitution.
 But when the consular and tribunitian powers were united, when they were vested for life in a single person, when the general of the army was, at the same time, the minister of the senate, and the representative of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, it was impossible to resist the exercise, nor was it easy to define the limits, of his <NORP>Imperial</NORP> prerogative.
 <NORP>Imperial</NORP> prerogatives.
 To these accumulated honours, the policy of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> soon added the splendid as well as important dignities of supreme pontiff, and of censor.
 By the former he acquired the management of the religion, and by the latter a legal inspection over the manners and fortunes, of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 If so many distinct and independent powers did not exactly unite with each other, the complaisance of the senate was prepared to supply every deficiency by the most ample and extraordinary concessions.
 The emperors, as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ministers of the republic, were exempted from the obligation and penalty of many inconvenient laws: they were authorised to convoke the senate, to make several motions in the same day, to recommend candidates for the honours of the state, to enlarge the bounds of the city, to employ the revenue at their discretion, to declare peace and war, to ratify treaties; and by a most comprehensive clause, they were empowered to execute whatsoever they should judge advantageous to the empire, and agreeable to the majesty of things private or public, human or divine.
 (14) The magistrates.
 When all the various powers of executive government were committed to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> magistrate, the ordinary magistrates of the commonwealth languished in obscurity, without vigour, and almost without business.
 The names and forms of the ancient administration were preserved by <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> with the most anxious care.
 The usual number of consuls, praetors, tribunes, (15) were annually invested with their respective ensigns of office, and continued to discharge some of their least important functions.
 Those honours still attracted the vain ambition of the Romans; and the emperors themselves, though invested for life with the powers of the consulship, frequently aspired to the title of that annual dignity, which they condescended to share with the most illustrious of their fellow-citizens.
 (16) In the election of these magistrates, the people, during the reign of Augustus, were permitted to expose all the inconveniences of a wild democracy.
 That artful prince, instead of discovering the least symptom of impatience, humbly solicited their suffrages for himself or his friends, and scrupulously practised all the duties of an ordinary candidate (17).
 But we may venture to ascribe to his councils, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> measure of the succeeding reign, by which the elections were transferred to the senate.
 (18) The assemblies of the people were for ever abolished, and the emperors were delivered from a dangerous multitude, who, without restoring liberty, might have disturbed, and perhaps endangered, the established government.
 The senate.
 By declaring themselves the protectors of the people, <PERSON>Marius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> had subverted the constitution of their country.
 But as soon as the senate had been humbled and disarmed, such an assembly, consisting of five or six hundred persons, was found a much more tractable and useful instrument of dominion.
 It was on the dignity of the senate, that <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and his successors founded their new empire; and they affected, on every occasion, to adopt the language and principles of Patricians.
 In the administration of their own powers they frequently consulted the great national council, and seemed to refer to its decision the most important concerns of peace and war.
 Rome, Italy, and the internal provinces, were subject to the immediate jurisdiction of the senate.
 With regard to civil objects, it was the supreme court of appeal; with regard to criminal matters, a tribunal constituted for the trial of all offences that were committed by men in any public station, or that affected the peace and majesty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 The exercise of the judicial power became the most frequent and serious occupation of the senate; and the important causes that were pleaded before them afforded a last refuge to the spirit of ancient eloquence.
 As a council of state, and as a court of justice, the senate possessed very considerable prerogatives; but in its legislative capacity, in which it was supposed virtually to represent the people, the rights of sovereignty were acknowledged to reside in that assembly.
 Every power was derived from their authority, every law was ratified by their sanction.
 Their regular meetings were held on <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> stated days in every month, the Calends, the Nones, and the Ides.
 The debates were conducted with decent freedom; and the emperors themselves, who glorified in the name of senators, sat, voted, and divided with their equals.
 General idea of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> system.
 To resume, in a few words, the system of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> government, as it was instituted by Augustus, and maintained by those princes who understood their own interest and that of the people, it may be defined an absolute monarchy disguised by the forms of a commonwealth.
 The masters of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world surrounded their throne with darkness, concealed their irresistible strength, and humbly professed themselves the accountable ministers of the senate, whose supreme decrees they dictated and obeyed.
 (19) Court of the emperors.
 The face of the court corresponded with the forms of the administration.
 The emperors, if we except those tyrants whose capricious folly violated every law of nature and decency, disdained that pomp and ceremony which might offend their countrymen, but could add nothing to their real power.
 In all the offices of life they affected to confound themselves with their subjects, and maintained with them an equal intercourse of visits and entertainments.
 Their habit, their palace, their table, were suited only to the rank of an opulent senator.
 Their family, however numerous or splendid, was composed entirely of their domestic slaves and freedmen.
 (20) <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> or <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> would have blushed at employing the meanest of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> in those menial offices, which, in the household and bedchamber of a limited monarch, are so eagerly solicited by the proudest nobles of Britain.
 Deification.
 The deification of the emperor (21) is the only instance in which they departed from their accustomed prudence and modesty.
 The Asiatic <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> inventors, the successors of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> objects, of this servile and impious mode of adulation.
 It was easily transferred from the kings to the governors of Asia; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrates very frequently were adored as provincial deities, with the pomp of altars and temples, of festivals and sacrifices.
 (22) It was natural that the emperors should not refuse what the proconsuls had accepted; and the divine honours which both the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> and the other received from the provinces, attested rather the despotism than the servitude of Rome.
 But the conquerors soon imitated the vanquished nations in the arts of flattery; and the imperious spirit of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> too easily consented to assume, during his lifetime, a place among the tutelar deities of Rome.
 The milder temper of his successor declined so dangerous an ambition, which was never afterwards revived, except by the madness of <PERSON>Caligula</PERSON> and Domitian.
 <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> permitted indeed some of the provincial cities to erect temples to his honour, on condition that they should associate the worship of <GPE>Rome</GPE> with that of the sovereign; he tolerated private superstition, of which he might be the object; (23) but he contented himself with being revered by the senate and people in his human character, and wisely left to his successor the care of his public deification.
 A regular custom was introduced, that on the decease of every emperor who had neither lived nor died like a tyrant, the senate by a solemn decree should place him in the number of the gods: and the ceremonies of his Apotheosis were blended with those of his funeral.
 This legal, and, as it should seem, injudicious profanation, so abhorrent to our stricter principles, was received with a faint murmur, (24) by the easy nature of polytheism; but it was received as an institution, not of religion, but of policy.
 We should disgrace the virtues of the Antonines, by comparing them with the vices of <PRODUCT>Hercules</PRODUCT> or Jupiter.
 Even the character of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> or <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> were far superior to those of the popular deities.
 But it was the misfortune of the former to live in an enlightened age, and their actions were too faithfully recorded to admit of such a mixture of fable and mystery, as the devotion of the vulgar requires.
 As soon as their divinity was established by law, it sunk into oblivion, without contributing either to their own fame, or to the dignity of succeeding princes.
 Titles of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Caesar.
 In the consideration of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> government, we have frequently mentioned the artful founder, under his well-known title of Augustus, which was not however conferred upon him till the edifice was almost completed.
 The obscure name of <PERSON>Octavianus</PERSON> he derived from a mean family in the little town of Aricia.
 It was stained with the blood of the proscription; and he was desirous, had it been possible, to erase all memory of his former life.
 The illustrious surname of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> he had assumed as the adopted son of the dictator; but he had too much good sense, either to hope to be confounded, or to wish to be compared, with that extraordinary man.
 It was proposed in the senate, to dignify their minister with a new appellation: and after a very serious discussion, that of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> was chosen, among several others, as being the most expressive of the character of peace and sanctity, which he uniformly affected.
 (25) <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> was therefore a personal, <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> a family distinction.
 The former should naturally have expired with the prince on whom it was bestowed; and however the latter was diffused by adoption and female alliance, <PERSON>Nero</PERSON> was the last prince who could allege any hereditary claim to the honours of the <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> line.
 But, at the time of his death, the practice of a century had inseparably connected those appellations with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity, and they have been preserved by a long succession of emperors, Romans, Greeks, Franks, and Germans, from the fall of the republic to the present time.
 A distinction was, however, soon introduced.
 The sacred title of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> was always reserved for the monarch, whilst the name of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> was more freely communicated to his relations; and, from the reign of Hadrian, at least, was appropriated to the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> person in the state, who was considered as the presumptive heir of the empire.
 Character and policy of Augustus.
 The tender respect of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> for a free constitution which he had destroyed, can only be explained by an attentive consideration of the character of that subtle tyrant.
 A cool head, an unfeeling heart, and a cowardly disposition, prompted him, at the age of nineteen, to assume the mask of hypocrisy, which he never afterwards laid aside.
 With the same hand, and probably with the same temper, he signed the proscription of Cicero, and the pardon of Cinna.
 His virtues, and even his vices, were artificial; and according to the various dictates of his interest, he was at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> the enemy, and at last the father, of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 (26) When he framed the artful system of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> authority his moderation was inspired by his fears.
 He wished to deceive the people by an image of civil liberty, and the armies by an image of civil government.
 Image of liberty for the people.
 I.
 The death of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> was ever before his eyes.
 He had lavished wealth and honours on his adherents; but the most favoured friends of his uncle were in the number of the conspirators.
 The fidelity of the legions might defend his authority against open rebellion; but their vigilance could not secure his person from the dagger of a determined republican; and the Romans, who revered the memory of Brutus, (27) would applaud the imitation of his virtue.
 <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> had provoked his fate, as much by the ostentation of his power as by his power itself.
 The consul or the tribune might have reigned in peace.
 The title of king had armed the <NORP>Romans</NORP> against his life.
 <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> was sensible that mankind is governed by names; nor was he deceived in his expectation, that the senate and people would submit to slavery, provided they were respectfully assured that they still enjoyed their ancient freedom.
 A feeble senate and enervated people cheerfully acquiesced in the pleasing illusion, as long as it was supported by the virtue, or even by the prudence, of the successors of Augustus.
 It was a motive of self-preservation, not a principle of liberty, that animated the conspirators against Caligula, Nero, and Domitian.
 They attacked the person of the tyrant, without aiming their blow at the authority of the emperor.
 Attempt of the senate after the death of Caligula.
 There appears, indeed, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> memorable occasion, in which the senate, after seventy <DATE>years</DATE> of patience, made an ineffectual attempt to reassume its long-forgotten rights.
 When the throne was vacant by the murder of Caligula, the consuls convoked that assembly in the Capitol, condemned the memory of the Caesars, gave the watchword liberty to the few cohorts who faintly adhered to their standard, and during eight and forty hours acted as the independent chiefs of a free commonwealth.
 But while they deliberated, the Praetorian Guards had resolved.
 The stupid Claudius, brother of Germanicus, was already in their camp, invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, and prepared to support his election by arms.
 The dream of liberty was at an end; and the senate awoke to all the horrors of inevitable servitude.
 Deserted by the people, and threatened by a military force, that feeble assembly was compelled to ratify the choice of the Praetorians, and to embrace the benefit of an amnesty, which <PERSON>Claudius</PERSON> had the prudence to offer, and the generosity to observe (28).
 Image of government for the armies.
 II.
 The insolence of the armies inspired <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> with fears of a still more alarming nature.
 The despair of the citizens could only attempt what the power of the soldiers was, at any time, able to execute.
 How precarious was his own authority over men whom he had taught to violate every social duty! He had heard their seditious clamours; he dreaded their calmer moments of reflection.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> revolution had been purchased by immense rewards; but a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> revolution might double those rewards.
 The troops professed the fondest attachment to the house of Caesar; but the attachments of the multitude are capricious and inconstant.
 <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> summoned to his aid whatever remained in those fierce minds of <NORP>Roman</NORP> prejudices; enforced the rigour of discipline by the sanction of law; and interposing the majesty of the senate between the emperor and the army, boldly claimed their allegiance, as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate of the republic.
 (29) Their obedience.
 During a long period of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and twenty years, from the establishment of this artful system to the death of Commodus, the dangers inherent to a military government were, in a great measure, suspended.
 The soldiers were seldom roused to that fatal sense of their own strength, and of the weakness of the civil authority, which was, before and afterwards, productive of such dreadful calamities.
 <PERSON>Caligula</PERSON> and <NORP>Domitian</NORP> were assassinated in their palace by their own domestics; the convulsions which agitated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the death of the former, were confined to the walls of the city.
 But <PERSON>Nero</PERSON> involved the whole empire in his ruin.
 In the space of eighteen months, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> princes perished by the sword; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world was shaken by the fury of the contending armies.
 Excepting only this short, though violent, eruption of military licence, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> centuries from <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to <NORP>Commodus</NORP> passed away unstained with civil blood, and undisturbed by revolutions.
 The emperor was elected by the authority of the senate, and the consent of the soldiers.
 (30) The legions respected their oath of fidelity; and it requires a minute inspection of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> annals to discover <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> inconsiderable rebellions, which were all suppressed in a few months, and without even the hazard of a battle.
 (31) Designation of a successor.
 In elective monarchies, the vacancy of the throne is a moment big with danger and mischief The <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors, desirous to spare the legions that interval of suspense, and the temptation of an irregular choice, invested their designed successor with so large a share of present power, as should enable him, after their decease, to assume the remainder, without suffering the empire to perceive the Of <PERSON>Tiberius</PERSON> change of masters.
 Thus Augustus, after all his fairer prospects had been snatched from him by untimely deaths rested his last hopes on Tiberius, obtained for his adopted son the censorial and tribunitian powers, and dictated a law by which the future prince was invested with an authority equal to his own, over the provinces and the armies.
 (32) Thus Of <PERSON>Titus</PERSON> <ORG>Vespasian</ORG> subdued the generous mind of his eldest son.
 <PERSON>Titus</PERSON> was adored by the eastern legions, which, under his command, had recently achieved the conquest of Judaea.
 His power was dreaded, and, as his virtues were clouded by the intemperance of youth, his designs were suspected.
 Instead of listening to such unworthy suspicions, the prudent monarch associated <PERSON>Titus</PERSON> to the full powers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity and the grateful son ever approved himself the humble and faithful minister of so indulgent a father.
 (33) The race of <ORG>Caesars</ORG> and the <NORP>Flavian</NORP> family.
 The good sense of <ORG>Vespasian</ORG> engaged him indeed to embrace every measure that might confirm his recent and precarious elevation.
 The military oath, and the fidelity of the troops, had been consecrated by the habits of an hundred years, to the name and family of the Caesars; and although that family had been continued only by the fictitious rite of adoption, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> still revered, in the person of Nero, the grandson of Germanicus, and the lineal successor of Augustus.
 It was not without reluctance and remorse that the Praetorian Guards had been persuaded to abandon the cause of the tyrant.
 (34) The rapid downfall of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, taught the armies to consider the emperors as the creatures of their will, and the instruments of their licence.
 The birth of <ORG>Vespasian</ORG> was mean; his grand-father had been a private soldier, his father a petty officer of the revenue; (35) his own merit had raised him, in an advanced age, to the empire; but his merit was rather useful, than shining, and his virtues were disgraced by a strict and even sordid parsimony.
 Such a prince consulted his true interest by the association of a son, whose more splendid and amiable character might turn the public attention from the obscure origin to the future glories of the <NORP>Flavian</NORP> house.
 Under the mild administration of Titus, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world enjoyed a transient felicity, and his beloved memory served to protect, above fifteen years, the vices of his brother Domitian.
 Adoption and character of Trajan.
 <PERSON>Nerva</PERSON> had scarcely accepted the purple from the assassins of <NORP>Domitian</NORP> before he discovered that his feeble age was unable to stem the torrent of public disorders, which had multiplied under the long tyranny of his predecessor.
 His mild disposition was respected by the good; but the degenerate <NORP>Romans</NORP> required a more vigorous character, whose justice should strike terror into the guilty.
 Though he had several relations, he fixed his choice on a stranger.
 He adopted Trajan, then about forty <DATE>years</DATE> of age, and who commanded a powerful army in the Lower Germany; and immediately, by a decree of the senate, declared him his colleague and successor in the empire.
 (36) It is sincerely to be lamented, that whilst we are fatigued with the disgustful relation of Nero's crimes and follies, we are reduced to collect the actions of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> from the glimmerings of an abridgment, or the doubtful light of a panegyric.
 There remains, however, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> panegyric far removed beyond the suspicion of flattery.
 Above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and fifty <DATE>years</DATE> after the death of Trajan, the senate, in pouring out the customary acclamations on the accession of a new emperor, wished that he might surpass the felicity of Augustus, and the virtue of Trajan.
 (37) Of Hadrian.
 We may readily believe, that the father of his country hesitated whether he ought to intrust the various and doubtful character of his kinsman <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> with sovereign power.
 In his last moments, the arts of the empress <PERSON>Plotina</PERSON> either fixed the irresolution of Trajan, or boldly supposed a fictitious adoption; (38) the truth of which could not be safely disputed, and <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> was peaceably acknowledged as his lawful successor.
 Under his reign, as has been already mentioned, the empire flourished in peace and prosperity.
 He encouraged the arts, reformed the laws, asserted military discipline, and visited all his provinces in person.
 His vast and active genius was equally suited to the most enlarged views and the minute details of civil policy.
 But the ruling passions of his soul were curiosity and vanity.
 As they prevailed, and as they were attracted by different objects, <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> was, by turns, an excellent prince, a ridiculous sophist, and a jealous tyrant.
 The general tenor of his conduct deserved praise for its equity and moderation.
 Yet in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of his reign, he put to death <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> consular senators, his personal enemies and men who had been judged worthy of empire; and the tediousness of a painful illness rendered him, at last, peevish and cruel.
 The senate doubted whether they should pronounce him a god or a tyrant; and the honours decreed to his memory were granted to the prayers of the pious Antoninus.
 (39) Adoption of the elder and younger Verus.
 The caprice of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> influenced his choice of a successor.
 After revolving in his mind several men of distinguished merit, whom he esteemed and hated, he adopted Aelius Verus, a gay and voluptuous nobleman, recommended by uncommon beauty to the lover of Antinous.
 (40) But while <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> was delighting himself with his own applause, and the acclamations of the soldiers, whose consent had been secured by an immense donative, the new <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> (41) was ravished from his embraces by an untimely death.
 He left only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> son.
 <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> commended the boy to the gratitude of the Antonines.
 He was adopted by Pius; and, on the accession of Marcus, was invested with an equal share of sovereign power.
 Among the many vices of this younger <PERSON>Verus</PERSON> he possessed <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> virtue; a dutiful reverence for his wiser colleague, to whom he willingly abandoned the ruder cares of empire.
 The philosophic emperor dissembled his follies, lamented his early death, and cast a decent veil over his memory.
 Adoption of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Antonines.
 As soon as Hadrian's passion was either gratified or disappointed, he resolved to deserve the thanks of posterity, by placing the most exalted merit on the <NORP>Roman</NORP> throne.
 His discerning eye easily discovered a senator about fifty <DATE>years</DATE> of age, blameless in all the offices of life, and a youth of about seventeen, whose riper <DATE>years</DATE> opened the fair prospect of every virtue: the elder of these was declared the son and successor of Hadrian, on condition, however, that he himself should immediately adopt the younger.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Antonines</PERSON> (for it is of them that we are now speaking) governed the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world forty-two years, with the same invariable spirit of wisdom and virtue.
 Although <PERSON>Pius</PERSON> had <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, (42) he preferred the welfare of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the interest of his family, gave his daughter <PERSON>Faustina</PERSON> in marriage to young Marcus, obtained from the senate the tribunitian and proconsular powers, and with a noble disdain, or rather ignorance of jealousy, associated him to all the labours of government.
 Marcus, on the other hand, revered the character of his benefactor, loved him as a parent, obeyed him as his sovereign, (43) and, after he was no more, regulated his own administration by the example and maxims of his predecessor.
 Their united reigns are possibly the only period of history in which the happiness of a great people was the sole object of government.
 Character and reign of Pius.
 <PERSON>Titus</PERSON> <PERSON>Antoninus</PERSON> <PERSON>Pius</PERSON> has been justly denominated a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Numa.
 The same love of religion, justice, and peace, was the distinguishing characteristic of both princes.
 But the situation of the latter opened a much larger field for the exercise of those virtues.
 Numa could only prevent a few neighbouring villages from plundering each other's harvests.
 <PERSON>Antoninus</PERSON> diffused order and tranquillity over the greatest part of the earth.
 His reign is marked by the rare advantage of furnishing very few materials for history; which is, indeed, little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind.
 In private life, he was an amiable as well as a good man.
 The native simplicity of his virtue was a stranger to vanity or affectation.
 He enjoyed with moderation the conveniences of his fortune, and the innocent pleasures of society: (44) and the benevolence of his soul displayed itself in a cheerful serenity of temper.
 Of Marcus.
 The virtue of <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> Aurelius <PERSON>Antoninus</PERSON> was of a severer and more laborious kind.
 (45) It was the well-earned harvest of many a learned conference, of many a patient lecture, and many a midnight lucubration.
 At the age of twelve <DATE>years</DATE> he embraced the rigid system of the Stoics, which taught him to submit his body to his mind, his passions to his reason; to consider virtue as the only good, vice as the only evil, all things external as things indifferent.
 (46) His meditations, composed in the tumult of a camp, are still extant; and he even condescended to give lessons of philosophy in a more public manner than was perhaps consistent with the modesty of a sage, or the dignity of an emperor.
 (47) But his life was the noblest commentary on the precepts of Zeno.
 He was severe to himself, indulgent to the imperfections of others, just and beneficent to all mankind.
 He regretted that Avidius Cassius, who excited a rebellion in Syria, had disappointed him, by a voluntary death, of the pleasure of converting an enemy into a friend; and he justified the sincerity of that sentiment, by moderating the zeal of the senate against the adherents of the traitor.
 (48) War he detested, as the disgrace and calamity of human nature; but when the necessity of a just defence called upon him to take up arms, he readily exposed his person to eight winter campaigns on the frozen banks of the Danube, the severity of which was at last fatal to the weakness of his constitution.
 His memory was revered by a grateful posterity, and above a century after his death, many persons preserved the image of <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> Antoninus, among those of their household gods.
 (49) Happiness of the Romans.
 If a man were called to fix the period in the history of the world, during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous, he would, without hesitation, name that which elapsed from the death of <NORP>Domitian</NORP> to the accession of Commodus.
 The vast extent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was governed by absolute power, under the guidance of virtue and wisdom.
 The armies were restrained by the firm but gentle hand of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> successive emperors, whose characters and authority commanded involuntary respect.
 The forms of the civil administration were carefully preserved by Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines, who delighted in the image of liberty, and were pleased with considering themselves as the accountable ministers of the laws.
 Such princes deserved the honour of restoring the republic had the <NORP>Romans</NORP> of their days been capable of enjoying a rational freedom.
 Its precarious nature.
 The labours of these monarchs were overpaid by the immense reward that inseparably waited on their success; by the honest pride of virtue, and by the exquisite delight of beholding the general happiness of which they were the authors.
 A just, but melancholy reflection embittered, however, the noblest of human enjoyments.
 They must often have recollected the instability of a happiness which depended on the character of a single man.
 The fatal moment was perhaps approaching, when some licentious youth, or some jealous tyrant, would abuse, to the destruction, that absolute power which they had exerted for the benefit of their people.
 The ideal restraints of the senate and the laws might serve to display the virtues, but could never correct the vices, of the emperor.
 The military force was a blind and irresistible instrument of oppression; and the corruption of <NORP>Roman</NORP> manners would always supply flatterers eager to applaud, and ministers prepared to serve the fear or the avarice, the lust or the cruelty, of their masters.
 Memory of Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, and Domitian.
 These gloomy apprehensions had been already justified by the experience of the Romans.
 The annals of the emperors exhibit a strong and various picture of human nature, which we should vainly seek among the mixed and doubtful characters of modern history.
 In the conduct of those monarchs we may trace the utmost lines of vice and virtue; the most exalted perfection, and the meanest degeneracy of our own species.
 The golden age of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> and the <PERSON>Antonines</PERSON> had been preceded by an age of iron.
 It is almost superfluous to enumerate the unworthy successors of Augustus.
 Their unparalleled vices, and the splendid theatre on which they were acted, have saved them from oblivion.
 The dark unrelenting Tiberius, the furious Caligula, the feeble Claudius, the profligate and cruel Nero, the beastly Vitellius, (50) and the timid inhuman Domitian, are condemned to everlasting infamy.
 During four-score <DATE>years</DATE> (excepting only the short and doubtful respite of Vespasian's reign (51)) <GPE>Rome</GPE> groaned beneath an unremitting tyranny, which exterminated the ancient families of the republic, and was fatal to almost every virtue, and every talent, that arose in that unhappy period.
 Peculiar misery of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> under their tyrants.
 Under the reign of these monsters the slavery of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was accompanied with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> peculiar circumstances, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> occasioned by their former liberty, the other by their extensive conquests, which rendered their condition more completely wretched than that of the victims of tyranny in any other age or country.
 From these causes were derived, <CARDINAL>1</CARDINAL> The exquisite sensibility of the sufferers; and, 2, the impossibility of escaping from the hand of the oppressor.
 Insensibility of the orientals.
 I.
 When <GPE>Persia</GPE> was governed by the descendants of Sefi, a race of princes whose wanton cruelty often stained their divan, their table, and their bed, with the blood of their favourites, there is a saying recorded of a young nobleman, that he never departed from the sultan's presence without satisfying himself whether his head was still on his shoulders.
 The experience of every day might almost justify the scepticism of Rustan.
 (52) Yet the fatal sword, suspended above him by a single thread, seems not to have disturbed the slumbers, or interrupted the tranquillity, of the Persian.
 The monarch's frown, he well knew, could level him with the dust; but the stroke of lightning or apoplexy might be equally fatal; and it was the part of a wise man to forget the inevitable calamities of human life in the enjoyment of the fleeting hour.
 He was dignified with the appellation of the king's slave; had, perhaps, been purchased from obscure parents in a country which he had never known; and was trained up from his infancy in the severe discipline of the seraglio.
 (53) His name, his wealth, his honours, were the gift of a master, who might, without injustice, resume what he had bestowed.
 Rustan's knowledge, if he possessed any, could only serve to confirm his habits by prejudices.
 His language afforded not words for any form of government, except absolute monarchy.
 The history of the <LOC>East</LOC> informed him, that such had ever been the condition of mankind.
 (54) The Koran, and the interpreters of that divine book, inculcated to him, that the sultan was the descendant of the prophet, and the vice-regent of heaven; that patience was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> virtue of a Mussulman, and unlimited obedience the great duty of a subject.
 Knowledge and free spirit of the Romans.
 The minds of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were very differently prepared for slavery.
 Oppressed beneath the weight of their own corruption and of military violence, they for a long while preserved the sentiments, or at least the ideas, of their freeborn ancestors.
 The education of <PERSON>Helvidius</PERSON> and Thrasea, of <NORP>Tacitus</NORP> and Pliny, was the same as that of <PERSON>Cato</PERSON> and Cicero.
 From <NORP>Grecian</NORP> philosophy they had imbibed the justest and most liberal notions of the dignity of human nature, and the origin of civil society.
 The history of their own country had taught them to revere a free, a virtuous, and a victorious commonwealth; to abhor the successful crimes of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Augustus; and inwardly to despise those tyrants whom they adored with the most abject flattery.
 As magistrates and senators, they were admitted into the great council which had once dictated laws to the earth, whose name still gave a sanction to the acts of the monarch, and whose authority was so often prostituted to the vilest purposes of tyranny.
 Tiberius, and those emperors who adopted his maxims, attempted to disguise their murders by the formalities of justice, and perhaps enjoyed a secret pleasure in rendering the senate their accomplice as well as their victim.
 By this assembly the last of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were condemned for imaginary crimes and real virtues.
 Their infamous accusers assumed the language of independent patriots, who arraigned a dangerous citizen before the tribunal of his country; and the public service was rewarded by riches and honours.
 (55) The servile judges professed to assert the majesty of the commonwealth, violated in the person of its <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate; (56) whose clemency they most applauded when they trembled the most at his inexorable and impending cruelty (57) The tyrant beheld their baseness with just contempt, and encountered their secret sentiments of detestation with sincere and avowed hatred for the whole body of the senate.
 Extent of their empire left them no place of refuge.
 II.
 The division of <LOC>Europe</LOC> into a number of independent states, connected, however, with each other, by the general resemblance of religion, language, and manners, is productive of the most beneficial consequences to the liberty of mankind.
 A modern tyrant who should find no resistance either in his own breast, or in his people, would soon experience a gentle restraint from the example of his equals, the dread of present censure, the advice of allies, and the apprehension of his enemies.
 The object of his displeasure, escaping from the narrow limits of his dominions, would easily obtain, in a happier climate, a secure refuge, a new fortune adequate to his merit, the freedom of complaint, and perhaps the means of revenge.
 But the empire of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> filled the world, and when that empire fell into the hands of a single person, the world became a safe and dreary prison for his enemies.
 The slave of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> despotism, whether he was condemned to drag his gilded chain in <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the senate, or to wear out a life of exile on the barren rock of Seriphus, or the frozen banks of the Danube, expected his fate in silent despair.
 (58) To resist was fatal, and it was impossible to fly.
 On every side he was encompassed with a vast extent of sea and land, which he could never hope to traverse without being discovered, seized, and restored to his irritated master.
 Beyond the frontiers, his anxious view could discover nothing, except the ocean, inhospitable deserts, hostile tribes of barbarians, of fierce manners and unknown language, or dependent kings, who would gladly purchase the emperor's protection by the sacrifice of an obnoxious fugitive.
