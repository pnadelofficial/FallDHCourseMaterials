D.
 395 IF the subjects of <GPE>Rome</GPE> could be ignorant of their obligations to the great Theodosius, they were too soon convinced how painfully the spirit and abilities of their deceased emperor had supported the frail and mouldering edifice of the republic.
 He died in the month of January; and before the end of the <DATE>winter</DATE> of the same year, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation was in arms.
 (1) The barbarian auxiliaries erected their independent standard, and boldly avowed the hostile designs which they had long cherished in their ferocious minds.
 Their countrymen, who had been condemned by the conditions of the last treaty to a life of tranquillity and labour, deserted their farms at the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> sound of the trumpet, and eagerly resumed the weapons which they had reluctantly laid down.
 The barriers of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were thrown open; the savage warriors of <ORG>Scythia</ORG> issued from their forests; and the uncommon severity of the <DATE>winter</DATE> allowed the poet to remark "that they rolled their ponderous wagons over the broad and icy back of the indignant river.
" (2) The unhappy natives of the provinces to the south of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> submitted to the calamities which, in the course of twenty years, were almost grown familiar to their imagination; and the various troops of barbarians who gloried in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> name were irregularly spread from the woody shores of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> to the walls of Constantinople.
 (3) The interruption, or at least the diminution, of the subsidy which the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had received from the prudent liberality of Theodosius, was the specious pretence of their revolt: the affront was embittered by their contempt for the unwarlike sons of Theodosius; and their resentment was inflamed by the weakness or treachery of the minister of Arcadius.
 The frequent visits of <PERSON>Rufinus</PERSON> to the camp of the barbarians, whose arms and apparel he affected to imitate, were considered as a sufficient evidence of his guilty correspondence; and the public enemy, from a motive either of gratitude or of policy, was attentive, amidst the general devastation, to spare the private estates of the unpopular praefect.
 The Goths, instead of being impelled by the blind and headstrong passions of their chiefs, were now directed by the bold and artful genius of Alaric.
 That renowned leader was descended from the noble race of the Balti,(4) which yielded only to the royal dignity of the Amali: he had solicited the command of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies; and the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court provoked him to demonstrate the folly of their refusal, and the importance of their loss.
 Whatever hopes might be entertained of the conquest of Constantinople, the judicious general soon abandoned an impracticable enterprise.
 In the midst of a divided court and a discontented people, the emperor <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> was terrified by the aspect of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms: but the want of wisdom and valour was supplied by the strength of the city; and the fortifications, both of the sea and land, might securely brave the impotent and random darts of the barbarians.
 <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> disdained to trample any longer on the prostrate and ruined countries of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Dacia, and he resolved to seek a plentiful harvest of fame and riches in a province which had hitherto escaped the ravages of war.
(5) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> marches into Greece, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>396</CARDINAL> The character of the civil and military officers on whom <PERSON>Rufinus</PERSON> had devolved the government of <GPE>Greece</GPE> confirmed the public suspicion that he had betrayed the ancient seat of freedom and learning to the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 The proconsul <PERSON>Antiochus</PERSON> was the unworthy son of a respectable father; and Gerontius; who commanded the provincial troops, was much better qualified to execute the oppressive orders of a tyrant than to defend, with courage and ability, a country most remarkably fortified by the hand of nature.
 <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had traversed, without resistance, the plains of <GPE>Macedonia</GPE> and Thessaly, as far as the foot of Mount Oeta, a steep and woody range of hills, almost impervious to his cavalry.
 They stretched from east to west, to the edge of the seashore; and left, between the precipice and the Malian Gulf, an interval of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> feet, which in some places was contracted to a road capable of admitting only a single carriage.
 (6) In this narrow pass of Thermopylae, where <PERSON>Leonidas</PERSON> and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <NORP>Spartans</NORP> had gloriously devoted their lives, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> might have been stopped, or destroyed, by a skilful general; and perhaps the view of that sacred spot might have kindled some sparks of military ardour in the breasts of the degenerate Greeks.
 The troops which had been posted to defend the straits of <GPE>Thermopylae</GPE> retired, as they were directed, without attempting to disturb the secure and rapid passage of Alaric;(7) and the fertile fields of <LOC>Phocis</LOC> and <GPE>Boeotia</GPE> were instantly covered by a deluge of barbarians, who massacred the males of an age to bear arms and drove away the beautiful females, with the spoil and cattle of the flaming villages.
 The travellers who visited <GPE>Greece</GPE> several years after wards could easily discover the deep and bloody traces of the march of the Goths; and <PERSON>Thebes</PERSON> was less indebted for her preservation to the strength of her <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> gates than to the eager haste of Alaric, who advanced to occupy the city of <GPE>Athens</GPE> and the important harbour of the Piraeus.
 The same impatience urged him to prevent the delay and danger of a siege, by the offer of a capitulation; and as soon as the <NORP>Athenians</NORP> heard the voice of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> herald, they were easily persuaded to deliver the greatest part of their wealth, as the ransom of the city of <PERSON>Minerva</PERSON> and its inhabitants.
 The treaty was ratified by solemn oaths, and observed with mutual fidelity.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince, with a small and select train, was admitted within the walls; he indulged himself in the refreshment of the bath, accepted a splendid banquet which was provided by the magistrate, and affected to show that he was not ignorant of the manners of civilised nations.
(8) But the whole territory of Attica, from the promontory of <GPE>Sunium</GPE> to the town of Megara, was blasted by his baleful presence; and, if we may use the comparison of a contemporary philosopher, <GPE>Athens</GPE> itself resembled the bleeding and empty skin of a slaughtered victim.
 The distance between <GPE>Megara</GPE> and <GPE>Corinth</GPE> could not much exceed <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> miles but the bad road, an expressive name, which it still bears among the Greeks, was, or might easily have been made, impassable for the march of an enemy.
 The thick and gloomy woods of Mount Cithasron covered the inland country; the <NORP>Scironian</NORP> rocks approached the water's edge, and hung over the narrow and winding path, which was confined above six miles along the seashore.
(9) The passage of those rocks, so infamous in every age, was terminated by the isthmus of Corinth; and a small body of firm and intrepid soldiers might have successfully defended a temporary entrenchment of five or six miles from the <LOC>Ionian</LOC> to the Aegean Sea.
 The confidence of the cities of <PERSON>Peloponnesus</PERSON> in their natural rampart had tempted them to neglect the care of their antique walls; and the avarice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> governors had exhausted and betrayed the unhappy province.
 (10) Corinth, Argos, Sparta, yielded without resistance to the arms of the Goths; and the most fortunate of the inhabitants were saved by death from beholding the slavery of their families and the conflagration of their cities.
(11) The vases and statues were distributed among the barbarians, with more regard to the value of the materials than to the elegance of the workmanship; the female captives submitted to the laws of war; the enjoyment of beauty was the reward of valour; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> could not reasonably complain of an abuse which was justified by the example of the heroic times.
 (12) The descendants of that extraordinary people, who had considered valour and discipline as the walls of Sparta, no longer remembered the generous reply of their ancestors to an invader more formidable than Alaric.
 From <GPE>Thermopylae</GPE> to <GPE>Sparta</GPE> the leader of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> pursued his victorious march without encountering any mortal antagonists; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the advocates of expiring <NORP>Paganism</NORP> has confidently asserted that the walls of <GPE>Athens</GPE> were guarded by the goddess Minerva, with her formidable Agis, and by the angry phantom of Achilles,(14) and that the conqueror was dismayed by the presence of the hostile deities of Greece.
 In an age of miracles it would perhaps be unjust to dispute the claim of the historian <PERSON>Zosimus</PERSON> to the common benefit, yet it cannot be dissembled that the mind of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was ill prepared to receive, either in sleeping or waking visions, the impressions of <NORP>Greek</NORP> superstition.
 The songs of <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> and the fame of <PERSON>Achilles</PERSON> had probably never reached the ear of the illiterate Barbarian; and the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith, which he had devoutly embraced, taught him to despise the imaginary deities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Athens.
 The invasion of the Goths, instead of vindicating the honours, contributed, at least accidentally, to extirpate the last remains of Paganism; and the mysteries of Ceres, which had subsisted eighteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, did not survive the destruction of <GPE>Eleusis</GPE> and the calamities of Greece.
(15) He is attacked by Stilicho, A.
D.
 397 The last hope of a people who could no longer depend on their arms, their gods, or their sovereign, was placed in the powerful assistance of the general of the West; and Stilicho, who had not been permitted to repulse, advanced to chastise the invaders of Greece.
 (16) A numerous fleet was equipped in the ports of Italy; and the troops, after a short and prosperous navigation over the <LOC>Ionian</LOC> Sea, were safely disembarked on the isthmus, near the ruins of Corinth.
 The woody and mountainous country of Arcadia, the fabulous residence of <PERSON>Pan</PERSON> and the Dryads, became the scene of a long and doubtful conflict between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals not unworthy of each other.
 The skill and perseverance of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> at length prevailed; and the Goths, after sustaining a considerable loss from disease and desertion, gradually retreated to the lofty mountain of Pholoe, near the sources of the Peneus, and on the frontiers of Elis—a sacred country, which had formerly been exempted from the calamities of war.
 (17) The camp of the barbarians was immediately besieged; the waters of the river (18) were diverted into another channel; and while they laboured under the intolerable pressure of thirst and hunger, a strong line of circumvallation was formed to prevent their escape.
 After these precautions Stilicho, too confident of victory, retired to enjoy his triumph in the theatrical games and lascivious dances of the Greeks; his soldiers, deserting their standards, spread themselves over the country of their allies, which they stripped of all that had been saved from the rapacious hands of the enemy.
 <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> appears to have seized the favourable moment to execute <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of those hardy enterprises in which the abilities of a general are displayed with more genuine lustre than in the tumult of a day of battle.
 To extricate himself from the prison of <PERSON>Peloponnesus</PERSON> it was necessary that he should pierce the entrenchments which surrounded his camp; that he should perform a difficult and dangerous march of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> miles, as far as the Gulf of Corinth; and that he should escapes to <PERSON>Epirus</PERSON> transport his troops, his captives, and his spoil, over an arm of the sea, which, in the narrow interval between <GPE>Rhium</GPE> and the opposite shore, is at least half a mile in breadth.
(19) The operations of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> must have been secret, prudent, and rapid, since the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general was confounded by the intelligence that the Goths, who had eluded his efforts, were in full possession of the important province of Epirus.
 This unfortunate delay allowed <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> sufficient time to conclude the treaty which he secretly negotiated with the ministers of Constantinople.
 The apprehension of a civil war compelled <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> to retire, at the haughty mandate of his rivals; from the dominions of Arcadius; and he respected, in the enemy of Rome, the honourable character of the ally and servant of the emperor of the East.
 <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> is declared master-general of <NORP>Eastern</NORP> Illyricum, A.
D.
 398, A <NORP>Grecian</NORP> philosopher, (20) who visited <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> soon after the death of Theodosius, published his liberal opinions concerning the duties of kings and the state of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic.
 <GPE>Synesius</GPE> observes and deplores the fatal abuse which the imprudent bounty of the late emperor had introduced into the military service.
 The citizens and subjects had purchased an exemption from the indispensable duty of defending their country, which was supported by the arms of barbarian mercenaries.
 The fugitives of <ORG>Scythia</ORG> were permitted to disgrace the illustrious dignities of the empire; their ferocious youth, who disdained the salutary restraint of laws, were more anxious to acquire the riches than to imitate the arts of a people the object of their contempt and hatred; and the power of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was the stone of Tantalus, perpetually suspended over the peace and safety of the devoted state.
 The measures which <GPE>Synesius</GPE> recommends are the dictates of a bold and generous patriot.
 He exhorts the emperor to revive the courage of his subjects by the example of manly virtue; to banish luxury from the court and from the camp; to substitute, in the place of the barbarian mercenaries, an army of men interested in the defence of their laws and of their property; to force, in such a moment of public danger, the mechanic from his shop and the philosopher from his school; to rouse the indolent citizen from his dream of pleasure; and to arm, for the protection of agriculture, the hands of the laborious husbandman.
 At the head of such troops, who might deserve the name and would display the spirit of Romans, he animates the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> to encounter a race of barbarians who were destitute of any real courage; and never to lay down his arms till he had chased them far away into the solitudes of Scythia, or had reduced them to the state of ignominious servitude which the <NORP>Lacedaemonians</NORP> formerly imposed on the captive Helots.
(21) The court of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> indulged the zeal, applauded the eloquence, and neglected the advice of Synesius.
 Perhaps the philosopher, who addresses the emperor of the <LOC>East</LOC> in the language of reason and virtue which he might have used to a <NORP>Spartan</NORP> king, had not condescended to form a practicable scheme, consistent with the temper and circumstances of a degenerate age.
 Perhaps the pride of the ministers, whose business was seldom interrupted by reflection, might reject, as wild and visionary, every proposal which exceeded the measure of their capacity, and deviated from the forms and precedents of office.
 While the oration of <GPE>Synesius</GPE> and the downfall of the barbarians were the topics of popular conversation, an edict was published at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> which declared the promotion of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> to the rank of master-general of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> Illyricum.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> provincials, and the allies who had respected the faith of treaties, were justly indignant that the ruin of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and <PERSON>Epirus</PERSON> should be so liberally rewarded.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror was received as a lawful magistrate in the cities which he had so lately besieged.
 The fathers whose sons he had massacred, the husbands whose wives he had violated, were subject to his authority; and the success of his rebellion encouraged the ambition of every leader of the foreign mercenaries.
 The use to which <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> applied his new command distinguishes the firm and judicious character of his policy.
 He issued his orders to the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> magazines and manufactures of offensive and defensive arms, Margus, Ratiaria, Naissus, and Thessalonica, to provide his troops with an extraordinary supply of shields, helmets, swords, and spears; the unhappy provincials were compelled to forge the instruments of their own destruction; and the barbarians removed the only defect which had sometimes disappointed the efforts of their courage.
(22) The birth of Alaric, the glory of his past exploits, and the confidence in his future designs, insensibly united the body of the nation under his victorious standards; and, with the unanimous consent of the barbarian chieftains, the master-general of <GPE>Illyricum</GPE> was elevated, according to ancient custom, on a shield, and solemnly and king of the Visigoths.
 proclaimed king of the Visigoths.
 (23) Armed with this double power, seated on the verge of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, he alternately sold his deceitful promises to the courts of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> and Honorius, (24) till he declared and executed his resolution of invading the dominions of the West.
 The provinces of <LOC>Europe</LOC> which belonged to the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> emperor were already exhausted, those of <LOC>Asia</LOC> were inaccessible, and the strength of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had resisted his attack.
 But he was tempted by the fame, the beauty, the wealth of Italy, which he had twice visited; and he secretly aspired to plant the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard on the walls of Rome, and to enrich his army with the accumulated spoils of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> triumphs.
 (25) He invades Italy, A.
D.
400-403 The scarcity of facts, (26) and the uncertainty of dates,(27) oppose our attempts to describe the circumstances of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric.
 His march, perhaps from Thessalonica, through the warlike and hostile country of Pannonia, as far as the foot of the Julian Alps; his passage of those mountains, which were strongly guarded by troops and entrenchments; the siege of Aquileia, and the conquest of the provinces of <GPE>Istria</GPE> and Venetia, appear to have employed a considerable time.
 Unless his operations were extremely cautious and slow, the length of the interval would suggest a probable suspicion that the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king retreated towards the banks of the Danube, and reinforced his army with fresh swarms of barbarians, before he again attempted to penetrate into the heart of Italy.
 Since the public and important events escape the diligence of the historian, he may amuse himself with contemplating for a moment the influence of the arms of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> on the fortunes of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> obscure individuals, a presbyter of Aquileia, and an husbandman of Verona.
 The learned Rufinus, who was summoned by his enemies to appear before a <NORP>Roman</NORP> synod,(28) wisely preferred the dangers of a besieged city; and the barbarians, who furiously shook the walls of Aquileia, might save him from the cruel sentence of another heretic, who, at the request of the same bishops, was severely whipped and condemned to perpetual exile on a desert island.
(29) The old man(30) who had passed his simple and innocent life in the neighbourhood of Verona, was a stranger to the quarrels both of kings and of bishops; his pleasures, his desires, his knowledge, were confined within the little circle of his paternal farm; and a staff supported his aged steps on the same ground where he had sported in his infancy.
 Yet even this humble and rustic felicity (which <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> describes with so much truth and feeling) was still exposed to the undistinguishing rage of war.
 His trees, his old contemporary trees,(31) must blaze in the conflagration of the whole country; a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry might sweep away his cottage and his family; and the power of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> could destroy this happiness, which he was not able either to taste or to bestow.
 the apprehensions of each individual were increased in just proportion to the measure of his fortune: and the most timid, who had already embarked their valuable effects, meditated their escape to the island of <LOC>Sicily</LOC> or the <NORP>African</NORP> coast.
 The public distress was aggravated by the fears and reproaches of superstition.
 (32) Every hour produced some horrid tale of strange and portentous accidents: the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> deplored the neglect of omens and the interruption of sacrifices; but the <NORP>Christians</NORP> still derived some comfort from the powerful intercession of the saints and martyrs.
 (33) <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> flies from Milan, A.
D.
 403.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was distinguished, above his subjects, by the pre-eminence of fear as well as of rank.
 The pride and luxury in which he was educated had not allowed him to suspect that there existed on the earth any power presumptuous enough to invade the repose of the successor of Augustus.
 The arts of flattery concealed the impending danger till <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> approached the palace of Milan.
 But when the sound of war had awakened the young emperor, instead of flying to arms with the spirit, or even the rashness, of his age, he eagerly listened to those timid counsellors who proposed to convey his sacred person and his faithful attendants to some secure and distant station in the provinces of Gaul.
 <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> alone (34) had courage and authority to resist this disgraceful measure, which would have abandoned <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> to the barbarians; but as the troops of the palace had been lately detached to the <NORP>Rhaetian</NORP> frontier, and as the resource of new levies was slow and precarious, the general of the <LOC>West</LOC> could only promise that, if the court of <GPE>Milan</GPE> would maintain their ground during his absence, he would soon return with an army equal to the encounter of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king.
 Without losing a moment (while each moment was so important to the public safety), <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> hastily embarked on the Larian lake, ascended the mountains of ice and snow amidst the severity of an <NORP>Alpine</NORP> winter, and suddenly repressed, by his unexpected presence, the enemy, who had disturbed the tranquillity of Rhaetia.
 (35) The barbarians, perhaps some tribes of the Alemanni, respected the firmness of a chief who still assumed the language of command; and the choice which he condescended to make of a select number of their bravest youth was considered as a mark of his esteem and favour.
 The cohorts, who were delivered from the neighbouring foe, diligently repaired to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> standard; and <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> issued his orders to the most remote troops of the West, to advance, by rapid marches, to the defence of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and of Italy.
 The fortresses of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> were abandoned; and the safety of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was protected only by the faith of the Germans, and the ancient terror of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name.
 Even the legion which had been stationed to guard the wall of <GPE>Britain</GPE> against the <NORP>Caledonians</NORP> of the <LOC>North</LOC> was hastily recalled, (36) and a numerous body of the cavalry of the <NORP>Alani</NORP> was persuaded to engage in the service of the emperor, who anxiously expected the return of his general.
 The prudence and vigour of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> were conspicuous on this occasion, which revealed, at the same time, the weakness of the falling empire.
 The legions of Rome, which had long since languished in the gradual decay of discipline and courage, were exterminated by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> and civil wars; and it was found impossible without exhausting and exposing the provinces, to assemble an army for the defence of Italy.
 He is pursued and besieged by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> When <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> seemed to abandon his sovereign in the unguarded palace of Milan, he had probably calculated the term of his absence, the distance of the enemy, and the obstacles that might retard their march.
 He principally depended on the rivers of Italy, the Adige, the Mincius, the Oglio, and the Addua, which, in the <DATE>winter</DATE> or spring, by the fall of rains, or by the melting of the snows, are commonly swelled into broad and impetuous torrents.
(37) But the season happened to be remarkably dry; and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> could traverse, without impediment, the wide and stony beds, whose centre was faintly marked by the course of a shallow stream.
 The bridge and passage of the <NORP>Addua</NORP> was secured by a strong detachment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army; and as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> approached the walls, or rather the suburbs, of Milan, he enjoyed the proud satisfaction of seeing the emperor of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> fly before him.
 Honorius, accompanied by a feeble train of statesmen and eunuchs, hastily retreated towards the Alps, with a design of securing his person in the city of Arles, which had often been the royal residence of his predecessors.
 But <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> (38) had scarcely passed the <LOC>Po</LOC> before he was overtaken by the speed of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry;(39) since the urgency of the danger compelled him to seek a temporary shelter within the fortification of Asta, a town of <GPE>Liguria</GPE> or Piemont, situate on the banks of the Tanarus.
(40) The siege of an obscure place, which contained so rich a prize, and seemed incapable of a long resistance, was instantly formed, and indefatigably pressed, by the king of the Goths; and the bold declaration, which the emperor might afterwards make, that his breast had never been susceptible of fear, did not probably obtain much credit even in his own court.
 (41) In the last and almost hopeless extremity, after the barbarians had already proposed the indignity of a capitulation, the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> captive was suddenly relieved by the fame, the approach, and at length the presence, of the hero whom he had so long expected.
 At the head of a chosen and intrepid vanguard, <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> swam the stream of the Addua, to gain the time which he must have lost in the attack of the bridge; the passage of the <LOC>Po</LOC> was an enterprise of much less hazard and difficulty; and the successful action, in which he cut his way through the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp under the walls of Asta, revived the hopes and vindicated the honour of Rome.
 Instead of grasping the fruit of his victory, the barbarian was gradually invested, on every side, by the troops of the West, who successively issued through all the passes of the Alps; his quarters were straitened; his convoys were intercepted; and the vigilance of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> prepared to form a chain of fortifications, and to besiege the lines of the besiegers.
 A military council was assembled of the long-haired chiefs of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation; of aged warriors, whose bodies were wrapped in furs, and whose stern countenances were marked with honourable wounds.
 They weighed the glory of persisting in their attempt against the advantage of securing their plunder, and they recommended the prudent measure of a seasonable retreat.
 In this important debate, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> displayed the spirit of the conqueror of Rome; and after he had reminded his countrymen of their achievements and of their designs, he concluded his animating speech by the solemn and positive assurance that he was resolved to find in <GPE>Italy</GPE> either a kingdom or a grave.
(42) Battle of Pollentia, A.
D.
 403, March 29.
 The loose discipline of the barbarians always exposed them to the danger of a surprise; but, instead of choosing the dissolute <TIME>hours</TIME> of riot and intemperance, <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> resolved to attack the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> whilst they were devoutly employed in celebrating the festival of Easter.
 (43) The execution of the stratagem, or, as it was termed by the clergy, of the sacrilege, was intrusted to Saul, a barbarian and a Pagan, who had served, however, with distinguished reputation among the veteran generals of Theodosius.
 The camp of the Goths, which <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had pitched in the neighbourhood of Pollentia, (44) was thrown into confusion by the sudden and impetuous charge of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> cavalry; but, in a few moments, the undaunted genius of their leader gave them an order and a field of battle; and, soon as they had recovered from their astonishment, the pious confidence that the God of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> would assert their cause added new strength to their native valour.
 In this engagement, which was long maintained with equal courage and success, the chief of the Alani, whose diminutive and savage form concealed a magnanimous soul, approved his suspected loyalty, by the zeal with which he fought and fell in the service of the republic; and the fame of this gallant barbarian has been imperfectly preserved in the verses of Claudian, since the poet, who celebrates his virtue, has omitted the mention of his name.
 His death was followed by the flight and dismay of the squadrons which he commanded; and the defeat of the wing of cavalry might have decided the victory of Alaric, if <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> had not immediately led the <NORP>Roman</NORP> and barbarian infantry to the attack.
 The skill of the general, and the bravery of the soldiers, surmounted every obstacle.
 In the evening of the bloody day, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retreated from the field of battle; the entrenchments of their camp were forced, and the scene of rapine and slaughter made some atonement for the calamities which they had inflicted on the subjects of the empire.
 (45) The magnificent spoils of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> and <LOC>Argos</LOC> enriched the veterans of the West; the captive wife of Alaric, who had impatiently claimed his promise of <NORP>Roman</NORP> jewels and <NORP>Patrician</NORP> handmaids,(46) was reduced to implore the mercy of the insulting foe; and many thousand prisoners, released from the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> chains, dispersed through the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> the praises of their heroic deliverer.
 The triumph of Stilicho(47) was compared by the poet, and perhaps by the public, to that of Marius; who, in the same part of Italy, had encountered and destroyed another army of Northern barbarians.
 The huge bones and the empty helmets of the <NORP>Cimbri</NORP> and of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> would easily be confounded by succeeding generations; and posterity might erect a common trophy to the memory of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most illustrious generals, who had vanquished, on the same memorable ground, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most formidable enemies of Rome.
(48) <PERSON>Boldnes</PERSON> and retreat of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> The eloquence of <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> (49) has celebrated, with lavish applause, the victory of Pollentia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most glorious days in the life of his patron; but his reluctant and partial muse bestows more genuine praise on the character of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king.
 His name is, indeed, branded with the reproachful epithets of pirate and robber, to which the conquerors of every age are so justly entitled; but the poet of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> is compelled to acknowledge that <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> possessed the invincible temper of mind which rises superior o every misfortune, and derives new resources from adversity.
 After the total defeat of his infantry, he escaped, or rather withdrew, from the field of battle, with the greatest part of his cavalry entire and unbroken.
 Without wasting a moment to lament the irreparable loss of so many brave companions, he left his victorious enemy to bind in chains the captive images of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king;(50) and boldly resolved to break through the unguarded passes of the Apennine, to spread desolation over the fruitful face of Tuscany, and to conquer or die before the gates of Rome.
 The capital was saved by the active and incessant diligence of Stilicho; but he respected the despair of his enemy; and, instead of committing the fate of the republic to the chance of another battle, he proposed to purchase the absence of the barbarians.
 The spirit of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> would have rejected such terms, the permission of a retreat, and the offer of a pension, with contempt and indignation; but he exercised a limited and precarious authority over the independent chieftains who had raised him, for their service, above the rank of his equals; they were still less disposed to follow an unsuccessful general, and many of them were tempted to consult their interest by a private negotiation with the minister of Honorius.
 The king submitted to the voice of his people, ratified the treaty with the empire of the West, and repassed the <LOC>Po</LOC> with the remains of the flourishing army which he had led into Italy.
 A considerable part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> forces still continued to attend his motions: and Stilicho, who maintained a secret correspondence with some of the barbarian chiefs, was punctually appraised of the designs that were formed in the camp and council of Alaric.
 The king of the Goths, ambitious to signalise his retreat by some splendid achievement, had resolved to occupy the important city of Verona, which commands the principal passage of the <NORP>Rhaetian</NORP> Alps; and, directing his march through the territories of those <NORP>German</NORP> tribes whose alliance would restore his exhausted strength, to invade, on the side of the Rhine, the wealthy and unsuspecting provinces of Gaul.
 Ignorant of the treason which had already betrayed his bold and judicious enterprise, he advanced towards the passes of the mountains, already possessed by the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> troops; where he was exposed, almost at the same instant, to a general attack in the front, on his flanks, and in the rear.
 In this bloody action, at a small distance from the walls of Verona, the loss of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was not less heavy than that which they had sustained in the defeat of Pollentia; and their valiant king, who escaped by the swiftness of his horse, must either have been slain or made prisoner, if the hasty rashness of the <NORP>Alani</NORP> had not disappointed the measures of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general.
 <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> secured the remains of his army on the adjacent rocks; and prepared himself, with undaunted resolution, to maintain a siege against the superior numbers of the enemy, who invested him on all sides.
 But he could not oppose the destructive progress of hunger and disease; nor was it possible for him to check the continual desertion of his impatient and capricious barbarians.
 In this extremity he still found resources in his own courage, or in the moderation of his adversary; and the retreat of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was considered as the deliverance of Italy.
(51) Yet the people, and even the clergy, incapable of forming any rational judgment of the business of peace and war, presumed to arraign the policy of Stilicho, who so often vanquished, so often surrounded, and so often dismissed the implacable enemy of the republic.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> moment of the public safety is devoted to gratitude and joy; but the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> is diligently occupied by envy and calumny.
(52) The triumph of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> at Rome, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>404</CARDINAL> The citizens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> had been astonished by the approach of Alaric; and the diligence with which they laboured to restore the walls of the capital confessed their own fears, and the decline of the empire.
 After the retreat of the barbarians, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was directed to accept the dutiful invitation of the senate, and to celebrate, in the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> city, the auspicious era of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> victory, and of his <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> consulship.
(53) The suburbs and the streets, from the <GPE>Milvian</GPE> bridge to the <PERSON>Palatine</PERSON> mount, were filled by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, who, in the space of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, had only thrice been honoured with the presence of their sovereigns.
 While their eyes were fixed on the chariot where <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> was deservedly seated by the side of his royal pupil, they applauded the pomp of a triumph which was not stained, like that of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> or of Theodosius, with civil blood.
 The procession passed under a lofty arch, which had been purposely erected: but in less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conquerors of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might read, if they were able to read, the superb inscription of that monument, which attested the total defeat and destruction of their nation.
 (54) The emperor resided several months in the capital, and every part of his behaviour was regulated with care to conciliate the affection of the clergy, the senate, and the people of Rome.
 The clergy was edified by his frequent visits, and liberal gifts, to the shrines of the apostles.
 The senate, who, in the triumphal procession, had been excused from the humiliating ceremony of preceding on foot the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> chariot, was treated with the decent reverence which <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> always affected for that assembly.
 The people was repeatedly gratified by the attention and courtesy of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> in the public games, which were celebrated on that occasion with a magnificence not unworthy of the spectator.
 As soon as the appointed number of chariot-races was concluded, the decoration of the circus was suddenly changed; the hunting of wild beasts afforded a various and splendid entertainment; and the chase was succeeded by a military dance, which seems, in the lively description of Claudian, to present the image of a modern tournament.
 The gladiators abolished.
 In these games of Honorius, the inhuman combats of gladiators(55) polluted for the last time the amphitheatre of Rome.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperor may claim the honour of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> edict which condemned the art and amusement of shedding human blood; (56) but this benevolent law expressed the wishes of the prince, without reforming an inveterate abuse which degraded a civilised nation below the condition of savage cannibals.
 Several hundred, perhaps several thousand, victims were annually slaughtered in the great cities of the empire; and the month of December, more peculiarly devoted to the combats of gladiators, still exhibited to the eyes of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people a grateful spectacle of blood and cruelty.
 Amidst the general joy of the victory of Pollentia, a <NORP>Christian</NORP> poet exhorted the emperor to extirpate, by his authority, the horrid custom which had so long resisted the voice of humanity and religion.
(57) The pathetic representations of <PERSON>Prudentius</PERSON> were less effectual than the generous boldness of Telemachus, an <NORP>Asiatis</NORP> monk, whose death was more useful to mankind than his life.
(58) The <NORP>Romans</NORP> were provoked by the interruption of their pleasures; and the rash monk, who had descended into the arena, to separate the gladiators, was overwhelmed under a shower of stones.
 But the madness of the people soon subsided: they respected the memory of Telemachus, who had deserved the honours of martyrdom; and they submitted, without a murmur, to the laws of Honorius, which abolished for ever the human sacrifices of the amphitheatre.
 The citizens, who adhered to the manners of their ancestors, might perhaps insinuate that the last remains of a martial spirit were preserved in this school of fortitude, which accustomed the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to the sight of blood, and to the contempt of death: a vain and cruel prejudice, so nobly confuted by the valour of ancient <GPE>Greece</GPE> and of modern Europe!(59) <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> fixes his residence at Ravenna, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>404</CARDINAL> The recent danger to which the person of the emperor had been exposed in the defenceless palace of <GPE>Milan</GPE> urged him to seek a retreat in some inaccessible fortress of Italy, where he might securely remain, while the open country was covered by a deluge of barbarians.
 On the coast of the Hadriatic, about ten or <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles from the most southern of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> mouths of the Po, the <NORP>Thessalians</NORP> had founded the ancient colony of RAVENNA,(60) which they afterwards resigned to the natives of Umbria.
 Augustus, who had observed the opportunity of the place, prepared, at the distance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles from the old town, a capacious harbour for the reception Of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty ships of war.
 This naval establishment, which included the arsenals and magazines, the barracks of the troops, and the houses of the artificers, derived its origin and name from the permanent station of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> fleet; the intermediate space was soon filled with buildings and inhabitants, and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> extensive and populous quarters of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> gradually contributed to form <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most important cities of Italy.
 The principal canal of <GPE>Augustus</GPE> poured a copious stream of the waters of the <LOC>Po</LOC> through the midst of the city, to the entrance of the harbour; the same waters were introduced into the profound ditches that encompassed the walls; they were distributed by a thousand subordinate canals into every part of the city, which they divided into a variety of small islands; the communication was maintained only by the use of boats and bridges; and the houses of Ravenna, whose appearance may be compared to that of Venice, were raised on the foundation of wooden piles.
 The adjacent country, to the distance of many miles, was a deep and impassable morass; and the artificial causeway which connected <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> with the continent might be easily guarded or destroyed on the approach of an hostile army.
 These morasses were interspersed, however, with vineyards; and though the soil was exhausted by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> or five crops, the town enjoyed a more plentiful supply of wine than of fresh water.
(61) The air, instead of receiving the sickly and almost pestilential exhalations of low and marshy grounds, was distinguished, like the neighbourhood of Alexandria, as uncommonly pure and salubrious; and this singular advantage was ascribed to the regular tides of the Hadriatic, which swept the canals, interrupted the unwholesome stagnation of the waters, and floated, every day, the vessels of the adjacent country into the heart of Ravenna.
 The gradual retreat of the sea has left the modern city at the distance of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> miles from the Hadriatic, and as early as the fifth or <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era the port of <GPE>Augustus</GPE> was converted into pleasant orchards, and a lonely grove of pines covered the ground where the <NORP>Roman</NORP> fleet once rode at anchor.
(62) Even this alteration contributed to increase the natural strength of the place, and the shallowness of the water was a sufficient barrier against the large ships of the enemy.
 This advantageous situation was fortified by art and labour; and in the twentieth year of his age the emperor of the West, anxious only for his personal safety, retired to the perpetual confinement of the walls and morasses of Ravenna.
 The example of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was imitated by his feeble successors, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kings, and afterwards the Exarchs, who occupied the throne and palace of the emperors; and till the middle of the eighth century <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was considered as the seat of government and the capital of Italy.
(63) The revolutions of Scythia, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>400</CARDINAL> The fears of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were not without foundation, nor were his precautions without effect.
 While <GPE>Italy</GPE> rejoiced in her deliverance from the Goths, a furious tempest was excited among the nations of Germany, who yielded to the irresistible impulse that appears to have been gradually communicated from the eastern extremity of the continent of Asia.
 The <NORP>Chinese</NORP> annals, as they have been interpreted by the learned industry of the present age, may be usefully applied to reveal the secret and remote causes of the fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The extensive territory to the north of the great wall was possessed after the flight of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> by the victorious Sienpi; who were sometimes broken into independent tribes, and sometimes re-united under a supreme chief; till at length, styling themselves Topa, or masters of the earth, they acquired a more solid consistence and a more formidable power.
 The <PERSON>Topa</PERSON> soon compelled the pastoral nations of the eastern desert to acknowledge the superiority of their arms; they invaded <GPE>China</GPE> in a period of weakness and intestine discord; and these fortunate Tartars, adopting the laws and manners of the vanquished people, founded an <ORG>Imperial</ORG> dynasty, which reigned near <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty years over the northern provinces of the monarchy.
 Some generations before they ascended the throne of China, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <PERSON>Topa</PERSON> princes had enlisted in his cavalry a slave of the name of Moko, renowned for his valour, but who was tempted, by the fear of punishment, to desert his standard, and to range the desert at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers.
 This gang of robbers and outlaws swelled into a camp, a tribe, a numerous people, distinguished by the appellation of 'Geougen'; and their hereditary chieftains, the posterity of <PERSON>Moko</PERSON> the slave, assumed their rank among the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> monarchs.
 The youth of Toulun, the greatest of his descendants, was exercised by those misfortunes which are the school of heroes.
 He bravely struggled with adversity, broke the imperious yoke of the Topa, and became the legislator of his nation and the conqueror of Tartary.
 His troops were distributed into regular bands of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and of a thousand men; cowards were stoned to death; the most splendid honours were proposed as the reward of valour; and Toulun, who had knowledge enough to despise the learning of China, adopted only such arts and institutions as were favourable to the military spirit of his government.
 His tents, which he removed in the <DATE>winter</DATE> season to a more southern latitude, were pitched during the summer on the fruitful banks of the Selinga.
 His conquests stretched from <LOC>Corea</LOC> far beyond the river Irtish.
 He vanquished, in the country to the north of the Caspian sea, the nation of the Huns; and the new title of Khan, or Cagan, expressed the fame and power which he derived from this memorable victory.
(64) Emigration of the northern Germans, A.
D.
 405 The chain of events is interrupted, or rather is concealed, as it passes from the <LOC>Volga</LOC> to the Vistula, through the dark interval which separates the extreme limits of the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> and of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> geography.
 Yet the temper of the barbarians, and the experience of successive emigrations, sufficiently declare that the Huns, who were oppressed by the arms of the Geougen, soon withdrew from the presence of an insulting victor.
 The countries towards the <NORP>Euxine</NORP> were already occupied by their kindred tribes; and their hasty flight, which they soon converted into a bold attack, would more naturally be directed towards the rich and level plains through which the <GPE>Vistula</GPE> gently flows into the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> sea.
 The <LOC>North</LOC> must again have been alarmed and agitated by the invasion of the Huns; and the nations who retreated before them must have pressed with incumbent weight on the confines of Germany.
(65) The inhabitants of those regions which the ancients have assigned to the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Burgundians, might embrace the resolution of abandoning to the fugitives of <NORP>Sarmatia</NORP> their woods and morasses, or at least discharging their superfluous numbers on the provinces of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (66) About <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years after the victorious <ORG>Toulun</ORG> had assumed the title of <PERSON>Khan</PERSON> of the Geougen, another barbarian, the haughty Rhodogast, or Radagaisus,(67) marched from the northern extremities of <GPE>Germany</GPE> almost to the gates of Rome, and left the remains of his army to achieve the destruction of the West.
 The Vandals, the Suevi, and the Burgundians, formed the strength of this mighty host; but the Alani, who had found an hospitable reception in their new seats, added their active cavalry to the heavy infantry of the Germans; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> adventurers crowded so eagerly to the standard of Radagaisus, that, by some historians, he has been styled the King of the Goths.
 Twelve thousand warriors, distinguished above the vulgar by their noble birth or their valiant deeds, glittered in the van; (68) and the whole multitude, which was not less than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand fighting men, might be increased, by the accession of women, of children, and of slaves, to the amount of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand persons.
 This formidable emigration issued from the same coast of the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> which had poured forth the myriads of the <NORP>Cimbri</NORP> and <NORP>Teutones</NORP> to assault <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> in the vigour of the republic.
 After the departure of those barbarians, their native country, which was marked by the vestiges of their greatness, long ramparts and gigantic moles,(69) remained, during some ages, a vast and dreary solitude; till the human species was renewed by the powers of generation, and the vacancy was filled by the influx of new inhabitants.
 The nations who now usurp an extent of land which they are unable to cultivate would soon be assisted by the industrious poverty of their neighbours, if the government of <LOC>Europe</LOC> did not protect the claims of dominion and property.
 <NORP>Radagaisus</NORP> invades Italy, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>406</CARDINAL> The correspondence of nations was in that age so imperfect and precarious, that the revolutions of the <LOC>North</LOC> might escape the knowledge of the court of Ravenna, till the dark cloud, which was collected along the coast of the Baltic, burst in thunder upon the banks of the Upper Danube.
 The emperor of the West, if his ministers disturbed his amusements by the news of the impending danger, was satisfied with being the occasion and the spectator of the war.
(70) The safety of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was intrusted to the counsels and the sword of Stilicho; but such was the feeble and exhausted state of the empire, that it was impossible to restore the fortifications of the Danube, or to prevent by a vigorous effort the invasion of the Germans.
 (71) The hopes of the vigilant minister of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were confined to the defence of Italy.
 He once more abandoned the provinces, recalled the troops, pressed the new levies, which were rigorously exacted and pusillanimously eluded; employed the most efficacious means to arrest or allure the deserters; and offered the gift of freedom and of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to all the slaves who would enlist.
 (72) By these efforts he painfully collected from the subjects of a great empire an army of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> or forty thousand men, which in the days of <GPE>Scipio</GPE> or Camillus, would have been instantly furnished by the free citizens of the territory of Rome.
(73) The <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> legions of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> were reinforced by a large body of barbarian auxiliaries; the faithful <NORP>Alani</NORP> were personally attached to his service; and the troops of <NORP>Huns</NORP> and of Goths, who marched under the banners of their native princes <PERSON>Huldin</PERSON> and Sarus, were animated by interest and resentment to oppose the ambition of Radagaisus.
 The king of the confederate <NORP>Germans</NORP> passed without resistance the Alps, the Po, and the Apennine; leaving on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hand the inaccessible palace of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> securely buried among the marshes of Ravenna, and, on the other, the camp of Stilicho, who had fixed his headquarters at Ticinum, or Pavia, but who seems to have avoided a decisive battle till he had assembled his distant forces.
 Many cities of <GPE>Italy</GPE> were pillaged or destroyed; Besieges <GPE>Florence</GPE> and the siege of Florence(74) by <NORP>Radagaisus</NORP> is <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the earliest events in the history of that celebrated republic, whose firmness checked and delayed the unskilful fury of the barbarians.
 The senate and people trembled at their approach within an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty miles of Rome, and anxiously compared the danger which they had escaped with the new perils to which they were exposed.
 <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was a <NORP>Christian</NORP> and a soldier, the leader of a disciplined army; who understood the laws of war, who respected the sanctity of treaties, and who had familiarly conversed with the subjects of the empire in the same camps and the same churches.
 The savage <NORP>Radagaisus</NORP> was a stranger to the manners, the religion, and even the language of the civilised nations of the South.
 The fierceness of his temper was exasperated by cruel superstition; and it was universally believed, and threatens <GPE>Rome</GPE> that he had bound himself by a solemn vow to reduce the city into a heap of stones and ashes, and to sacrifice the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators on the altars of those gods who were appeased by human blood.
 The public danger, which should have reconciled all domestic animosities, displayed the incurable madness of religious faction.
 The oppressed votaries of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> and <LOC>Mercury</LOC> respected, in the implacable enemy of Rome, the character of a devout Pagan; loudly declared that they were more apprehensive of the sacrifices than of the arms of Radagaisus; and secretly rejoiced in the calamities of their country, which condemned the faith of their <NORP>Christian</NORP> adversaries.
(75) Defeat and destruction of his army by Stilicho, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>406</CARDINAL> <GPE>Florence</GPE> was reduced to the last extremity; and the fainting courage of the citizens was supported only by the authority of St.
 Ambrose, who had communicated in a dream the promise of a speedy deliverance.
 (76) On a sudden they beheld from their walls the banners of Stilicho, who advanced with his united force to the relief of the faithful city, and who soon marked that fatal spot for the grave of the barbarian host.
 The apparent contradictions of those writers who variously relate the defeat of Radagaisus, may be reconciled without offering much violence to their respective testimonies.
 <PERSON>Orosius</PERSON> and Augustin, who were intimately connected by friendship and religion, ascribe this miraculous victory to the providence of God rather than to the valour of man.
 (77) They strictly exclude every idea of chance, or even of bloodshed, and positively affirm that the Romans, whose camp was the scene of plenty and idleness, enjoyed the distress of the barbarians slowly expiring on the sharp and barren ridge of the hills of Faesula, which rise above the city of Florence.
 Their extravagant assertion that not a single soldier of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> army was killed, or even wounded, may be dismissed with silent contempt; but the rest of the narrative of <PERSON>Augustin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Orosius</PERSON> is consistent with the state of the war and the character of Stilicho.
 Conscious that he commanded the last army of the republic his prudence would not expose it in the open field to the headstrong fury of the Germans.
 The method of surrounding the enemy with strong lines of circumvallation, which he had twice employed against the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, was repeated on a larger scale and with more considerable effect.
 The examples of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> must have been familiar to the most illiterate of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> warriors; and the fortifications of Dyrrachium, which connected <CARDINAL>twenty-four</CARDINAL> castles by a perpetual ditch and rampart of fifteen miles, afforded the model of an entrenchment which might confine and starve the most numerous host of barbarians.
(78) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops had less degenerated from the industry than from the valour of their ancestors; and if the servile and laborious work offended the pride of the soldiers, <GPE>Tuscany</GPE> could supply many thousand peasants who would labour, though perhaps they would not fight, for the salvation of their native country.
 The imprisoned multitude of horses and men (79) was gradually destroyed by famine other than by the sword; but the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were exposed during the progress of such an extensive work to the frequent attacks of an impatient enemy.
 The despair of the hungry barbarians would precipitate them against the fortifications of Stilicho; the general might sometimes indulge the ardour of his brave auxiliaries, who eagerly pressed to assault the camp of the Germans; and these various incidents might produce the sharp and bloody conflict; which dignify the narrative of <PERSON>Zosimus</PERSON> and the Chronicles of Prosper and Marcellinus.
 (80) A seasonable supply of men and provisions had been introduced into the walls of Florence, and the famished host of <NORP>Radagaisus</NORP> was in its turn besieged.
 The proud monarch of so many warlike nations, after the loss of his bravest warriors, was reduced to confide either in the faith of a capitulation, or in the clemency of Stilicho.
(81) But the death of the royal captive, who was ignominiously beheaded, disgraced the triumph of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of Christianity; and the short delay of his execution was sufficient to brand the conqueror with the guilt of cool and deliberate cruelty.
(82) The famished <NORP>Germans</NORP> who escaped the fury of the auxiliaries were sold as slaves, at the contemptible price of as many single pieces of gold; but the difference of food and climate swept away great numbers of those unhappy strangers; and it was observed that the inhuman purchasers, instead of reaping the fruits of their labour, were soon obliged to provide the expense of their internment.
 <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> informed the emperor and the senate of his success, and deserved a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time the glorious title of <PERSON>Deliverer</PERSON> of Italy.
(83) The remainder of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> invade Gaul, A.
D.
 406, December 31.
 The fame of the victory, and more especially of the miracle, has encouraged a vain persuasion that the whole army, or rather nation, of <NORP>Germans</NORP> who migrated from the shores of the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> miserably perished under the walls of Florence.
 Such indeed was the fate of <NORP>Radagaisus</NORP> himself, of his brave and faithful companions, and of more than one-third of the various multitude of <NORP>Sueves</NORP> and Vandals, of <NORP>Alani</NORP> and Burgundians, who adhered to the standard of their general.
 (84) The union of such an army might excite our surprise, but the causes of separation are obvious and forcible: the pride of birth, the insolence of valour, the jealousy of command, the impatience of subordination, and the obstinate conflict of opinions, of interests, and of passions, among so many kings and warriors, who were untaught to yield or to obey.
 After the defeat of Radagaisus, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> parts of the <NORP>German</NORP> host, which must have exceeded the number of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand men, still remained in arms between the <LOC>Apennine</LOC> and the Alps, or between the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and the Danube.
 It is uncertain whether they attempted to revenge the death of their general; but their irregular fury was soon diverted by the prudence and firmness of Stilicho, who opposed their march and facilitated their retreat, who considered the safety of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> as the great object of his care, and who sacrificed with too much indifference the wealth and tranquillity of the distant provinces.
 (85) The barbarians acquired, from the junction of some <NORP>Pannonian</NORP> deserters, the knowledge of the country and of the roads, and the invasion of Gaul, which <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had designed, was executed by the remains of the great army of Radagaisus.
(86) Yet if they expected to derive any assistance from the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> who inhabited the banks of the Rhine, their hopes were disappointed.
 The <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> preserved a state of inactive neutrality, and the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> distinguish their zeal and courage in the defence of the empire.
 In the rapid progress down the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> which was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of the administration of Stilicho, he had applied himself with peculiar attention to secure the alliance of the warlike Franks, and to remove the irreconcilable enemies of peace and of the republic.
 <PERSON>Marcomil</PERSON> <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their kings, was publicly convicted before the tribunal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate of violating the faith of treaties.
 He was sentenced to a mild but distant exile in the province of Tuscany; and this degradation of the regal dignity was so far from exciting the resentment o his subjects, that they punished with death the turbulent Sunno, who attempted to revenge his brother, and maintained a dutiful allegiance to the princes who were established on the throne by the choice of Stilicho.
(87) When the limits of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Germany</GPE> were shaken by the northern emigration, the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> bravely encountered the single force of the Vandals, who regardless of the lessons of adversity, had again separated their troops from the standard of their barbarian allies.
 They paid the penalty of their rashness; and twenty thousand Vandals, with their king Godigisclus, were slain in the field of battle.
 The whole people must have been extirpated if the squadrons of the Alani, advancing to their relief, had not trampled down the infantry of the Franks, who, after an honourable resistance, were compelled to relinquish the unequal contest.
 The victorious confederates pursued their march, and on the last day of the year, in a season when the waters of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> were most probably frozen, they entered without opposition the defenceless provinces of Gaul.
 This memorable passage of the Suevi, the Vandals, the Alani, and the Burgundians, who never afterwards retreated, may be considered as the fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire in the countries beyond the Alps; and the barriers, which had so long separated the savage and the civilised nations of the earth, were from that fatal moment levelled with the ground.
(88) Desolation of Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>407</CARDINAL> While the peace of <GPE>Germany</GPE> was secured by the attachment of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and the neutrality of the Alemanni, the subjects of Rome, unconscious of their approaching calamities, enjoyed the state of quiet and prosperity which had seldom blessed the frontiers of Gaul.
 Their flocks and herds were permitted to graze in the pastures of the barbarians; their huntsmen penetrated, without fear or danger, into the darkest recesses of the <NORP>Hercynian</NORP> wood.
(89) The banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> were crowned, like those of the Tiber, with elegant houses and well-cultivated farms; and if a poet descended the river, he might express his doubt on which side was situated the territory of the Romans.
(90) This scene of peace and plenty was suddenly changed into a desert; and the prospect of the smoking ruins could alone distinguish the solitude of nature from the desolation of man.
 The flourishing city of <GPE>Mentz</GPE> was surprised and destroyed, and many thousand <NORP>Christians</NORP> were inhumanly massacred in the church.
 Worms perished after a long and obstinate siege; Strasburg, Spires, Rheims, Tournay, Arras, Amiens, experienced the cruel oppression of the <NORP>German</NORP> yoke; and the consuming flames of war spread from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> over the greatest part of the <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul.
 That rich and extensive country, as far as the ocean, the Alps, and the Pyrenees, was delivered to the barbarians, who drove before them in a promiscuous crowd the bishop, the senator, and the virgin, laden with the spoils of their houses and altars.
 (91) The ecclesiastics, to whom we are indebted for this vague description of the public calamities, embraced the opportunity of exhorting the <NORP>Christians</NORP> to repent of the sins which had provoked the Divine Justice, and to renounce the perishable, goods of a wretched and deceitful world.
 But as, the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> controversy,(92) which attempts to sound the abyss of grace and predestination, soon became the serious employment of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> clergy, the <ORG>Providence</ORG> which had decreed, or foreseen, or permitted, such a train of moral and natural evils, was rashly weighed in the imperfect and fallacious balance of reason.
 The crimes and the misfortunes of the suffering people were presumptuously compared with those of their ancestors, and they arraigned the Divine Justice, which did not exempt from the common destruction, the feeble, the guiltless, the infant portion of the human species.
 These idle disputants overlooked the invariable laws of nature, which have connected peace with innocence, plenty with industry, and safety with valour.
 The timid and selfish policy of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> might recall the <PERSON>Palatine</PERSON> legions for the protection of Italy; the remains of the stationary troops might be unequal to the arduous task; and the barbarian auxiliaries might prefer the unbounded licence of spoil to the benefits of a moderate and regular stipend.
 But the provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> were filled with a numerous race of hardy and robust youth, who, in the defence of their houses, their families, and their altars, if they had dared to die, would have deserved to vanquish.
 The knowledge of their native country would have enabled them to oppose continual and insuperable obstacles to the progress of an invader; and the deficiency of the barbarians in arms as well as in discipline removed the only pretence which excuses the submission of a populous country to the inferior numbers of a veteran army.
 When <GPE>France</GPE> was invaded by Charles the Fifth, he inquired of a prisoner how many 'days' <GPE>Paris</GPE> might be distant from the frontier; "Perhaps 'twelve', but they will be days of battle:" (93) such was the gallant answer which checked the arrogance of that ambitious prince.
 The subjects of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and those of Francis I.
 were animated by a very different spirit, and in less than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years the divided troops of the savages of the Baltic, whose numbers, were they fairly stated, would appear contemptible, advanced without a combat to the foot of the Pyrenaean mountains.
 Revolt of the <NORP>British</NORP> army, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>407</CARDINAL> In the early part of the reign of Honorius, the vigilance of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> had successfully guarded the remote island of <GPE>Britain</GPE> from her incessant enemies of the ocean, the mountains, and the <NORP>Irish</NORP> coast.
 (94) But those restless barbarians could not neglect the fair opportunity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war, when the walls and stations of the province were stripped of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops.
 If any of the legionaries were permitted to return from the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition, their faithful report of the court and character of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> must have tended to dissolve the bounds of allegiance, and to exasperate the seditious temper of the <NORP>British</NORP> army.
 The spirit of revolt, which had formerly disturbed the age of Gallienus, was revived by the capricious violence of the soldiers; and the unfortunate, perhaps the ambitious, candidates, who were the objects of their choice, were the instruments, and at length the victims, of their passion.
(95) <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> whom they placed on the throne, as the lawful emperor of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and of the West.
 They violated, by the hasty murder of Marcus, the oath of fidelity which they had imposed on themselves; and their disapprobation of his manners may seem to inscribe an honourable epitaph on his tomb.
 <NORP>Gratian</NORP> was the next whom they adorned with the diadem and the purple; and, at the end of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> months, <NORP>Gratian</NORP> experienced the fate of his predecessor.
 The memory of the great Constantine, whom the <NORP>British</NORP> legions had given to the church and to the empire, suggested the singular motive of their <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> choice.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> Is Acknowledged in <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>407</CARDINAL> They discovered in the ranks a private soldier of the name of Constantine, and their impetuous levity had already seated him on the throne, before they perceived his incapacity to sustain the weight of that glorious appellation.
(96) Yet the authority of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was less precarious, and his government was more successful, than the transient reigns of <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> and of Gratian.
 The danger of leaving his inactive troops in those camps which had been twice polluted with blood and sedition urged him to attempt the reduction of the <NORP>Western</NORP> provinces.
 He landed at <GPE>Boulogne</GPE> with an inconsiderable force; and after he had reposed himself some days, he summoned the cities of Gaul, which had escaped the yoke of the barbarians, to acknowledge their lawful sovereign.
 They obeyed the summons without reluctance.
 The neglect of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> had absolved a deserted people from the duty of allegiance; their actual distress encouraged them to accept any circumstances of change, without apprehension, and, perhaps, with some degree of hope; and they might flatter themselves that the troops, the authority, and even the name of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor, who fixed his residence in Gaul, would protect the unhappy country from the rage of the barbarians.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> successes of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> against the detached parties of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> were magnified by the voice of adulation into splendid and decisive victories, which the reunion and insolence of the enemy soon reduced to their just value.
 His negotiations procured a short and precarious truce; and if some tribes of the barbarians were engaged, by the liberality of his gifts and promises, to undertake the defence of the Rhine, these expensive and uncertain treaties, instead of restoring the pristine vigour of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> frontier, served only to disgrace the majesty of the prince, and to exhaust what yet remained of the treasures of the republic.
 Elated however with this imaginary triumph, the vain deliverer of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> advanced into the provinces of the South, to encounter a more pressing and personal danger.
 <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> the <NORP>Goth</NORP> was ordered to lay the head of the rebel at the feet of the emperor Honorius; and the forces of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> were unworthily consumed in this domestic quarrel.
 After the loss of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bravest generals, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and Nevigastes, the former whom was slain in the field of battle, the last in a peaceful but treacherous interview, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> fortified himself within the walls of Vienna.
 The place was ineffectually attacked <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days; and the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> army supported, in a precipitate retreat, the ignominy of purchasing a secure passage from the freebooters and outlaws of the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (97) Those mountains now separated the dominions of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rival monarchs: and the fortifications of the double frontier were guarded by the troops of the empire, whose arms would have been more usefully employed to maintain the <NORP>Roman</NORP> limits against the barbarians of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
 He reduces Spain, A.
D.
 408 On this side of the Pyrenees, the ambition of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> might be justified by the proximity of danger; but his throne was soon established by the conquest, or rather submission, of Spain, which yielded to the influence of regular and habitual subordination, and received the laws and magistrates of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> praefecture.
 The only opposition which was made to the authority of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> proceeded not so much from the powers of government, or the spirit of the people, as from the private zeal and interest of the family of Theodosius.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> brothers(98) had obtained, by the favour of their kinsman, the deceased emperor, an honourable rank, and ample possessions, in their native country; and the grateful youths resolved to risk those advantages in the service of his son.
 After an unsuccessful effort to maintain their ground at the head of the stationary troops of Lusitania, they retired to their estates; where they armed and levied, at their own expense, a considerable body of slaves and dependents, and boldly marched to occupy the strong posts of the Pyrenaean mountains.
 This domestic insurrection alarmed and perplexed the sovereign of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Britain; and he was compelled to negotiate with some troops of barbarian auxiliaries, for the service of the Spanish war.
 They were distinguished by the title of Honorarians, (99) a name which might have reminded them of their fidelity to their lawful sovereign; and if it should candidly be allowed that the <NORP>Scots</NORP> were influenced by any partial affection for a <NORP>British</NORP> prince, the <NORP>Moors</NORP> and the <PERSON>Marcomanni</PERSON> could be tempted only by the profuse liberality of the usurper, who distributed among the barbarians the military, and even the civil, honours of Spain.
 The <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> bands of Honorians, which may be easily traced on the establishment of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, could not exceed the number of five thousand men; yet this inconsiderable force was sufficient to terminate a war which had threatened the power and safety of Constantine.
 The rustic army of the <NORP>Theodosian</NORP> family was surrounded and destroyed in the Pyrenees: <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of the brothers had the good fortune to escape by sea to <GPE>Italy</GPE> or the East; the other two, after an interval of suspense, were executed at Arles; and if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> could remain insensible of the public disgrace, he might perhaps be affected by the personal misfortunes of his generous kinsmen.
 Such were the feeble arms which decided the possession of the <NORP>Western</NORP> provinces of Europe, from the wall of <GPE>Antoninus</GPE> to the Columns of Hercules.
 The events of peace and war have undoubtedly been diminished by the narrow and imperfect view of the historians of the times, who were equally ignorant of the causes and of the effects of the most important revolutions.
 But the total decay of the national strength had annihilated even the last resource of a despotic government; and the revenue of exhausted provinces could no longer purchase the military service of a discontented and pusillanimous people.
 Negotiations of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> and Stilicho, A.
D.
 404-408 The poet, whose flattery has ascribed to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> eagle the victories of <ORG>Pollentia</ORG> and Verona, pursues the hasty retreat of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> from the confines of Italy, with a horrid train of imaginary spectres, such as might hover over an army of barbarians which was almost exterminated by war, famine, and disease.
(100) In the course of this unfortunate expedition, the king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> must indeed have sustained a considerable loss; and his harassed forces required an interval of repose to recruit their numbers and revive their confidence.
 Adversity had exercised and displayed the genius of Alaric; and the fame of his valour invited to the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard the bravest of the barbarian warriors, who, from the <NORP>Euxine</NORP> to the Rhine, were agitated by the desire of rapine and conquest.
 He had deserved the esteem, and he soon accepted the friendship, of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> himself.
 Renouncing the service of the emperor of the East, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> concluded with the court of Ravenna, a treaty of peace and alliance, by which he was declared master-general of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies throughout the praefecture of Illyricum; as it was claimed, according to the true and ancient limits, by the minister of Honorius.
(101) The execution of the ambitious design, which was either stipulated or implied in the articles of the treaty, appears to have been suspended by the formidable irruption of Radagaisus; and the neutrality of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king may perhaps be compared to the indifference of Caesar, who, in the conspiracy of Catiline, refused either to assist or to oppose the enemy of the republic.
 After the defeat of the Vandals, <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> resumed his pretensions to the provinces of the East; appointed civil magistrates for the administration of justice and of the finances; and declared his impatience to lead to the gates of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> the united armies of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and of the Goths.
 The prudence, however, of Stilicho, his aversion to civil war, and his perfect knowledge of the weakness of the state, may countenance the suspicion that domestic peace, rather than foreign conquest, was the object of his policy; and that his principal care was to employ the forces of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> at a distance from Italy.
 This design could not long escape the penetration of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who continued to hold a doubtful, and perhaps a treacherous, correspondence with the rival courts; who protracted, like a dissatisfied mercenary, his languid operations of <PERSON>Thessaly</PERSON> and Epirus; and who soon returned to claim the extravagant reward of his ineffectual services.
 From his camp near Aemona,(102) on the confines of Italy, he transmitted to the emperor of the <LOC>West</LOC> a long account of promises, of expenses, and of demands; called for immediate satisfaction, and clearly intimated the consequences of a refusal.
 Yet, if his conduct was hostile, his language was decent and dutiful.
 He humbly professed himself the friend of Stilicho, and the soldier of Honorius; offered his person and his troops to march, without delay, against the usurper of Gaul; and solicited, as a permanent retreat for the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation, the possession of some vacant province of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 Debates of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, A.
D.
 408 The political and secret transactions of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> statesmen who laboured to deceive each other and the world must for ever have been concealed in the impenetrable darkness of the cabinet, if the debates of a popular assembly had not thrown some rays of light on the correspondence of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> and Stilicho.
 The necessity of finding some artificial support for a government which, from a principle, not of moderation, but of weakness, was reduced to negotiate with its own subjects, had insensibly revived the authority of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate: and the minister of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> respectfully consulted the legislative council of the republic.
 <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> assembled the senate in the palace of the Caesars; represented, in a studied oration, the actual state of affairs; proposed the demands of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king; and submitted to their consideration the choice of peace or war.
 The senators, as if they had been suddenly awakened from a dream of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, appeared on this important occasion to be inspired by the courage, rather than by the wisdom; of their predecessors.
 They loudly declared, in regular speeches or in tumultuary acclamations, that it was unworthy of the majesty of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to purchase a precarious and disgraceful truce from a barbarian king; and that, in the judgment of a magnanimous people, the chance of ruin was always preferable to the certainty of dishonour.
 The minister, whose pacific intentions were seconded only by the voices of a few servile and venal followers, attempted to allay the general ferment, by an apology for his own conduct, and even for the demands of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 These ostensible reasons, which faintly disguise the obscure intrigues of the palace of Ravenna, were supported by the authority of Stilicho; and obtained, after a warm debate, the reluctant approbation of the senate.
 The tumult of virtue and freedom subsided; and the sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand pounds of gold was granted, under the name of a subsidy, to secure the peace of Italy, and to conciliate the friendship of the king of the Goths.
 <PERSON>Lampadius</PERSON> alone, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious members of the assembly, still persisted in his dissent; exclaimed with a loud voice, and escaped the danger of such bold opposition by immediately retiring to the sanctuary of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> church.
 Intrigue of the palace, A.
D.
 408, May But the reign of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> drew towards its end; and the proud minister might perceive the symptoms of his approaching disgrace.
 The generous boldness of <PERSON>Lampadius</PERSON> had been applauded; and the senate, so patiently resigned to a long servitude, rejected with disdain the offer of invidious and imaginary freedom.
 The troops, who still assumed the name and prerogatives of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions, were exasperated by the partial affection of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> for the barbarians: and the people imputed to the mischievous policy of the minister the public misfortunes, which were the natural consequence of their own degeneracy.
 Yet <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> might have continued to brave the clamours of the people, and even of the soldiers, if he could have maintained his dominion over the feeble mind of his pupil.
 But the respectful attachment of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was converted into fear, suspicion and hatred.
 The crafty Olympius,(104) who concealed his vices under the mask of <NORP>Christian</NORP> piety, had secretly undermined the benefactor by whose favour he was promoted to the honourable offices of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> palace.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> revealed to the unsuspecting emperor, who had attained the twenty-fifth year of his age, that he was without weight or authority in his own government; and artfully alarmed his timid and indolent disposition by a lively picture of the designs of Stilicho, who already meditated the death of his sovereign, with the ambitious hope of placing the diadem on the head of his son Eucherius.
 The emperor was instigated by his new favourite to assume the tone of independent dignity; and the minister was astonished to find that secret resolutions were formed in the court and council, which were repugnant to his interest, or to his intentions.
 Instead of residing in the palace of Rome, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> declared that it was his pleasure to return to the secure fortress of Ravenna.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of the death of his brother Arcadius, he prepared to visit Constantinople, and to regulate, with the authority of a guardian, the provinces of the infant Theodosius.
(105) The representation of the difficulty and expense of such a distant expedition checked this strange and sudden sally of active diligence; but the dangerous project of showing the emperor to the camp of Pavia, which was composed of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops, the enemies of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> and his barbarian auxiliaries, remained fixed and unalterable.
 The minister was pressed, by the advice of his confidant, Justinian, a <NORP>Roman</NORP> advocate, of a lively and penetrating genius, to oppose a journey so prejudicial to his reputation and safety.
 His strenuous, but ineffectual, efforts confirmed the triumph of Olympius; and the prudent lawyer withdrew himself from the impending ruin of his patron.
 Disgrace and death of Stlicho, A.
D.
 408, August <CARDINAL>23</CARDINAL> In the passage of the emperor through <GPE>Bologna</GPE> a mutiny of the guards was excited and appeased by the secret policy of Stilicho, who announced his instructions to decimate the guilty, and ascribed to his own intercession the merit of their pardon.
 After this tumult, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> embraced, for the last time, the minister whom he now considered as a tyrant, and proceeded on his way to the camp of Pavia, where he was received by the loyal acclamations of the troops who were assembled for the service of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> war.
 On the morning of the fourth day he pronounced, as he had been taught, a military oration in the presence of the soldiers, whom the charitable visits and artful discourses of <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> had prepared to execute a dark and bloody conspiracy.
 At the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> signal they massacred the friends of Stilicho, the most illustrious officers of the empire; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefects, of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and of Italy; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> masters-general of the cavalry and infantry; the master of the offices, the quaestor, the treasurer, and the count of the domestics.
 Many lives were lost, many houses were plundered; the furious sedition continued to rage till the close of the evening; and the trembling emperor, who was seen in the streets of <PERSON>Pavia</PERSON> without his robes or diadem, yielded to the persuasions of his favourite, condemned the memory of the slain, and solemnly approved the innocence and fidelity of their assassins.
 The intelligence of the massacre of <PERSON>Pavia</PERSON> filled the mind of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> with just and gloomy apprehensions, and he instantly summoned, in the camp of Bologna, a council of the confederate leaders who were attached to his service, and would be involved in his ruin.
 The impetuous voice of the assembly called aloud for arms and for revenge; to march, without a moment's delay, under the banners of a hero whom they had so often followed to victory; to surprise, to oppress, to extirpate the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> and his degenerate Romans, and perhaps to fix the diadem on the head of their injured general.
 Instead of executing a resolution which might have been justified by success, <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> hesitated till he was irrecoverably lost.
 He was still ignorant of the fate of the emperor; he distrusted the fidelity of his own party and he viewed with horror the fatal consequences of arming a crowd of licentious barbarians against the soldiers and people of Italy.
 The confederates, impatient of his timorous and doubtful delay, hastily retired with fear and indignation.
 At the hour of midnight Sarus, a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> warrior, renowned among the barbarians themselves for his strength and valour, suddenly invaded the camp of his benefactor, plundered the baggage, cut in pieces the faithful <NORP>Huns</NORP> who guarded his person, and penetrated to the tent, where the minister, pensive and sleepless, meditated on the dangers of his situation.
 <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> escaped with difficulty from the sword of the Goth, and after issuing a last and generous admonition to the cities of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to shut their gates against the barbarians, his confidence or his despair urged him to throw himself into Ravenna, which was already in the absolute possession of his enemies.
 Olympius, who had assumed the dominion of Honorius, was speedily informed that his rival had embraced, as a suppliant, the altar of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> church.
 The base and cruel disposition of the hypocrite was incapable of pity or remorse; but he piously affected to elude, rather than to violate, the privilege of the sanctuary.
 Count Heraclian, with a troop of soldiers, appeared at the dawn of day before the gates of the church of Ravenna.
 The bishop was satisfied by a solemn oath that the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> mandate only directed them to secure the person of Stilicho: but as soon as the unfortunate minister had been tempted beyond the holy threshold, he produced the warrant for his instant execution.
 <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> supported with calm resignation the injurious names of traitor and parricide; repressed the unseasonable zeal of his followers, who were ready to attempt an ineffectual rescue; and, with a firmness not unworthy of the last of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals, submitted his neck to the sword of Heraclian.
(106) His memory persecuted The servile crowd of the palace, who had so long adored the fortune of Stilicho, affected to insult his fall; and the most distant connection with the master-general of the West, which had so lately been a title to wealth and honours, was studiously denied, and rigorously punished.
 His family, united by a triple alliance with the family of Theodosius, might envy the condition of the meanest peasant.
 The flight of his son <PERSON>Eucherius</PERSON> was intercepted, and the death of that innocent youth soon followed the divorce of Thermantia, who filled the place of her sister Maria, and who, like Maria, had remained a virgin in the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> bed.
(107) The friends of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> who had escaped the massacre of <PERSON>Pavia</PERSON> were persecuted by the implacable revenge of Olympius, and the most exquisite cruelty was employed to extort the confession of a treasonable and sacrilegious conspiracy.
 They died in silence; their firmness justified the choice, (108) and perhaps absolved the innocence, of their patron; and the despotic power which could take his life without a trial, and stigmatise his memory without a proof, has no jurisdiction over the impartial suffrage of posterity.
(109) The services of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> are great and manifest; his crimes, as they are vaguely stated in the language of flattery and hatred, are obscure, at least, and improbable.
 About <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> months after his death an edict was published, in the name of Honorius, to restore the free communication of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, which had been so long interrupted by the public enemy.
(110) The minister, whose fame and fortune depended on the prosperity of the state, was accused of betraying <GPE>Italy</GPE> to the barbarians, whom he repeatedly vanquished at Pollentia, at Verona, and before the walls of Florence.
 His pretended design of placing the diadem on the head of his son <PERSON>Eucherius</PERSON> could not have been conducted without preparations or accomplices, and the ambitious father would not surely have left the future emperor, till the twentieth year of his age, in the humble station of tribune of the notaries.
 Even the religion of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> was arraigned by the malice of his rival.
 The seasonable, and almost miraculous, deliverance was devoutly celebrated by the applause of the clergy, who asserted that the restoration of idols and the persecution of the church would have been the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> measure of the reign of Eucherius.
 The son of Stilicho, however, was educated in the bosom of Christianity, which his father had uniformly professed and zealously supported.
(111) <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> had borrowed her magnificent necklace from the statue of <PERSON>Vesta</PERSON> ; (112) and the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> execrated the memory of the sacrilegious minister, by whose order the <NORP>Sibylline</NORP> books, the oracles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> had been committed to the flames.
(113) The pride and power of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> constituted his real guilt.
 An honourable reluctance to shed the blood of his countrymen appears to have contributed to the success of his unworthy rival; and it is the last humiliation of the character of Honorius, that posterity has not condescended to reproach him with his base ingratitude to the guardian of his youth and the support of his empire.
 The poet <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> Among the train of dependents whose wealth and dignity attracted the notice of their own times, our curiosity is excited by the celebrated name of the poet Claudian, who enjoyed the favour of Stilicho, and was overwhelmed in the ruin of his patron.
 The titular offices of tribune and notary fixed his rank in the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court.
 He was indebted to the powerful intercession of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> for his marriage with a rich heiress of the province of Africa;(114) and the statue of Claudian, erected in the forum of Trajan, was a monument of the taste and liberality of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
(115) After the praises of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> became offensive and criminal, <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> was exposed to the enmity of a powerful and unforgiving courtier whom he had provoked by the insolence of wit.
 He had compared, in a lively epigram, the opposite characters of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefects of Italy; he contrasts the innocent repose of a philosopher, who sometimes resigned the <TIME>hours</TIME> of business to slumber, perhaps to study, with the interested diligence of a rapacious minister, indefatigable in the pursuit of unjust or sacrilegious gain.
 The repose of <PERSON>Mallius</PERSON> was not disturbed by this friendly and gentle admonition; but the cruel vigilance of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> watched the opportunity of revenge, and easily obtained from the enemies of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> the trifling sacrifice of an obnoxious poet.
 The poet concealed himself, however, during the tumult of the revolution, and consulting the dictates of prudence rather than of honour, he addressed, in the form of an epistle, a suppliant and humble recantation to the offended praefect.
 He deplores, in mournful strains, the fatal indiscretion into which he had been hurried by passion and folly; submits to the imitation of his adversary the generous examples of the clemency of gods, of heroes, and of lions; and expresses his hope that the magnanimity of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> will not trample on a defenceless and contemptible foe, already humbled by disgrace and poverty, and deeply wounded by the exile, the tortures, and the death of his dearest friends.
(117) Whatever might be the success of his prayer or the accidents of his future life, the period of a few years levelled in the grave the minister and the poet: but the name of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> is almost sunk in oblivion, while <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> is read with pleasure in every country which has retained or acquired the knowledge of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> language.
 If we fairly balance his merits and his defects, we shall acknowledge that <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> does not either satisfy or silence our reason.
 It would not be easy to produce a passage that deserves the epithet of sublime or pathetic; to select a verse that melts the heart or enlarges the imagination.
 We should vainly seek in the poems of <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> the happy invention and artificial conduct of an interesting fable, or the just and lively representation of the characters and situations of real life.
 For the service of his patron he published occasional panegyrics and invectives, and the design of these slavish compositions encouraged his propensity to exceed the limits of truth and nature.
 These imperfections, however, are compensated in some degree by the poetical virtues of Claudian.
 He was endowed with the rare and precious talent of raising the meanest, of adoring the most barren, and of diversifying the most similar topics; his colouring, more especially in descriptive poetry, is soft and splendid; and he seldom fails to display, and even to abuse, the advantages of a cultivated understanding, a copious fancy, an easy and sometimes forcible expression, and a perpetual flow of harmonious versification.
 To these commendations, independent of any accidents of time and place, we must add the peculiar merit which <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> derived from the unfavourable circumstances of his birth.
 In the decline of arts and of empire, a native of Egypt,(118) who had received the education of a Greek, assumed in a mature age the familiar use and absolute command of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> language;(119) soared above the heads of his feeble contemporaries; and placed himself, after an interval of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, among the poets of ancient Rome.
(120)
