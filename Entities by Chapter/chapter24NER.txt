The <ORG>Caesars</ORG> of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> THE philosophical fable which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> composed under the name of the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> (1) is <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most agreeable and instructive productions of ancient wit.
(2) During the freedom and equality of the days of the Saturnalia, <PERSON>Romulus</PERSON> prepared a feast for the deities of Olympus, who had adopted him as a worthy associate, and for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes, who had reigned over his martial people and the vanquished nations of the earth.
 The immortals were placed in just order on their thrones of state, and the table of the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> was spread below the moon, in the upper region of the air.
 The tyrants, who would have disgraced the society of gods and men, were thrown headlong, by the inexorable Nemesis, into the <NORP>Tartarean</NORP> abyss.
 The rest of the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> successively advanced to their seats; and as they passed, the vices, the defects, the blemishes of their respective characters, were maliciously noticed by old Silenus, a laughing moralist, who disguised the wisdom of a philosopher under the mask of a Bacchanal.
(3) As soon as the feast was ended, the voice of <PERSON>Mercury</PERSON> proclaimed the will of Jupiter, that a celestial crown should be the reward of superior merit.
 Julius Caesar, Augustus, Trajan, and <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> Antoninus, were selected as the most illustrious candidates; the effeminate Constantine(4) was not excluded from this honourable competition; and the great <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> was invited to dispute the prize of glory with the <NORP>Roman</NORP> heroes.
 Each of the candidates was allowed to display the merit of his own exploits; but, in the judgment of the gods, the modest silence of <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> pleaded more powerfully than the elaborate orations of his haughty rivals.
 When the judges of this awful contest proceeded to examine the heart and to scrutinise the springs of action, the superiority of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> Stoic appeared still more decisive and conspicuous.
 (5) <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> and Caesar, Augustus, Trajan, and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> acknowledged, with a blush, that fame, or power, or pleasure, had been the important object of their labours; but the gods themselves beheld with reverence and love a virtuous mortal, who had practised on the throne the lessons of philosophy, and who, in a state of human imperfection, had aspired to imitate the moral attributes of the Deity.
 The value of this agreeable composition (the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> of Julian) is enhanced by the rank of the author.
 A prince, who delineates with freedom the vices and virtues of his predecessors, subscribes, in every line, the censure or approbation of his own conduct.
 He resolves to march against the Persians, A.
D.
 362 In the cool moments of reflection, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> preferred the useful and benevolent virtues of Antoninus; but his ambitious spirit was inflamed by the glory of Alexander, and he solicited, with equal ardour, the esteem of the wise and the applause of the multitude.
 In the season of life when the powers of the mind and body enjoy the most active vigour, the emperor, who was instructed by the experience and animated by the success of the German war, resolved to signalise his reign by some more splendid and memorable achievement.
 The ambassadors of the East, from the continent of <GPE>India</GPE> and the isle of Ceylon,(6) had respectfully saluted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> purple.
 (7) The nations of the <LOC>West</LOC> esteemed and dreaded the personal virtues of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> both in peace and war.
 He despised the trophies of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> victory,(8) and was satisfied that the rapacious barbarians of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> would be restrained from any future violation of the faith of treaties by the terror of his name and the additional fortifications with which he strengthened the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> and <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontiers.
 The successor of <PERSON>Cyrus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Artaxerxes</PERSON> was the only rival whom he deemed worthy of his arms, and he resolved, by the final conquest of Persia, to chastise the haughty nation which had so long resisted and insulted the majesty of Rome.
 (9) As soon as the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch was informed that the throne of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was filled by a prince of a very different character, he condescended to make some artful or perhaps sincere overtures towards a negotiation of peace.
 But the pride of <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> was astonished by the firmness of Julian, who sternly declared that he would never consent to hold a peaceful conference among the flames and ruins of the cities of Mesopotamia, and who added, with a smile of contempt, that it was needless to treat by ambassadors, as he himself had determined to visit speedily the court of Persia.
 The impatience of the emperor urged the diligence of the military preparations.
 The generals were named, a formidable army was destined for this important service, and Julian, marching from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> through the provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, <DATE>August</DATE> arrived at <GPE>Antioch</GPE> about eight months after the death of his predecessor.
 His ardent desire to march into the heart of <GPE>Persia</GPE> was checked by the indispensable duty of regulating the state of the empire, by his zeal to revive the worship of the gods, and by the advice of his wisest friends, who represented the necessity of allowing the salutary interval of <DATE>winter</DATE> quarters to restore the exhausted strength of the legions of <GPE>Gaul</GPE> and the discipline and spirit of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> troops.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was persuaded to fix, till the ensuing spring, his residence at Antioch, among a people maliciously disposed to deride the haste and to censure the delays of their sovereign.
(10) Licentious manners of the people of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> If <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had flattered himself that his personal connection with the capital of the <LOC>East</LOC> would be productive of mutual satisfaction to the prince and people, he made a very false estimate of his own character and of the manners of Antioch.
 (11) The warmth of the climate disposed the natives to the most intemperate enjoyment of tranquillity and opulence, and the lively licentiousness of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was blended with the hereditary softness of the Syrians.
 Fashion was the only law, pleasure the only pursuit, and the splendour of dress and furniture was the only distinction of the citizens of Antioch.
 The arts of luxury were honoured, the serious and manly virtues were the subject of ridicule, and the contempt for female modesty and reverent age announced the universal corruption of the capital of the <LOC>East.
</LOC> The love of spectacles was the taste, or rather passion, of the Syrians; the most skilful artists were procured from the adjacent cities;(12) a considerable share of the revenue was devoted to the public amusements, and the magnificence of the games of the theatre and circus was considered as the happiness and as the glory of Antioch.
 The rustic manners of a prince who disdained such glory, and was insensible of such happiness, soon disgusted the delicacy of his subjects, and the effeminate <NORP>Orientals</NORP> could neither imitate nor admire the severe simplicity which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> always maintained and sometimes affected.
 The days of festivity, consecrated by ancient custom to the honour of the gods, were the only occasions in which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> relaxed his philosophic severity, and those festivals were the only days in which the <NORP>Syrians</NORP> of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> could reject the allurements of pleasure.
 The majority of the people supported the glory of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> name, which had been <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invented by their ancestors:(13) they contented themselves with disobeying the moral precepts, but they were scrupulously attached to the speculative doctrines, of their religion.
 The church of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> was distracted by heresy and schism; but the <NORP>Arians</NORP> and the Athanasians, the followers of <PERSON>Meletius</PERSON> and those of Paulinus,(14) were actuated by the same pious hatred of their common adversary.
 Their aversion to <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> The strongest prejudice was entertained against the character of an apostate, the enemy and successor of a prince who had engaged the affections of a very numerous sect, and the removal of St.
 Babylas excited an implacable opposition to the person of Julian.
 His subjects complained with superstitious indignation, that famine had pursued the emperor's steps from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to Antioch, and the discontent of a hungry people was exasperated by the injudicious attempt to relieve their distress.
 Scarcity of corn, and public discontent.
 The inclemency of the season had affected the harvests of Syria, and the price of bread (15) in the markets of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> had naturally risen in proportion to the scarcity of corn.
 But the fair and reasonable proportion was soon violated by the rapacious arts of monopoly.
 In this unequal contest, in which the produce of the land is claimed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> party as his exclusive property, is used by another as a lucrative object of trade, and is required by a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> for the daily and necessary support of life, all the profits of the intermediate agents are accumulated on the head of the defenceless consumers.
 The hardships of their situation were exaggerated and increased by their own impatience and anxiety, and the apprehension of a scarcity gradually produced the appearances of a famine.
 When the luxurious citizens of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> complained of the high price of poultry and fish, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> publicly declared that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a regular supply of wine, oil, and bread; but he acknowledged that it was the duty of a sovereign to provide for the subsistence of his people.
 With this salutary view the emperor ventured on a very dangerous and doubtful step, of fixing, by legal authority, the value of corn.
 He enacted that, in a time of scarcity, it should be sold at a price which had seldom been known in the most plentiful years; and that his own example might strengthen his laws, he sent into the market <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty-two</CARDINAL> thousand modii, or measures, which were drawn by his order from the granaries of Hierapolis, of Chalcis, and even of Egypt.
 The consequences might have been foreseen, and were soon felt.
 The <NORP>Imperial</NORP> wheat was purchased by the rich merchants; the proprietors of land or of corn withheld from the city the accustomed supply; and the small quantities that appeared in the market were secretly sold at an advanced and illegal price.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> still continued to applaud his own policy, treated the complaints of the people as a vain and ungrateful murmur, and convinced <GPE>Antioch</GPE> that he had inherited the obstinacy, though not the cruelty, of his brother Gallus.
(16) The remonstrances of the municipal senate served only to exasperate his inflexible mind.
 He was persuaded, perhaps with truth, that the senators of Antioch, who possessed lands or were concerned in trade, had themselves contributed to the calamities of their country; and he imputed the disrespectful boldness which they assumed to the sense, not of public duty, but of private interest.
 The whole body, consisting of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred of the most noble and wealthy citizens, were sent, under a guard, from the palace to the prison; and though they were permitted, before the close of evening, to return to their respective houses,(17) the emperor himself could not obtain the forgiveness which he had so easily granted.
 The same grievances were still the subject of the same complaints, which were industriously circulated by the wit and levity of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> Greeks.
 During the licentious days of the Saturnalia, the streets of the city resounded with insolent songs, which derided the laws, the religion, the personal conduct, and even the beard of the emperor; and the spirit of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> was manifested by the connivance of the magistrates and the applause of the multitude.
 (18) The disciple of <PERSON>Socrates</PERSON> was too deeply affected by these popular insults; but the monarch, endowed with quick sensibility and possessed of absolute power, refused his passions the gratification of revenge.
 A tyrant might have proscribed, without distinction, the lives and fortunes of the citizens of Antioch; and the unwarlike <NORP>Syrians</NORP> must have patiently submitted to the lust, the rapaciousness, and the cruelty of the faithful legions of Gaul.
 A milder sentence might have deprived the capital of the <LOC>East</LOC> of its honours and privileges, and the courtiers, perhaps the subjects of Julian, would have applauded an act of justice which asserted the dignity of the supreme magistrate of the republic.
 (19)Julian composes a satire against <GPE>Antioch</GPE> But instead of abusing or exerting the authority of the state to revenge his personal injuries, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> contented himself with an inoffensive mode of retaliation, which it would be in the power of few princes to employ.
 He had been insulted by satires and libels; in his turn he composed, under the title of the Enemy of the Beard, an ironical confession of his own faults, and a severe satire of the licentious and effeminate manners of Antioch.
 This <NORP>Imperial</NORP> reply was publicly exposed before the gates of the palace; and the MISOPOGON(20) still remains a singular monument of the resentment, the wit, the humanity, and the indiscretion of Julian.
 Though he affected to laugh, he could not forgive.
(21) His contempt was expressed, and his revenge might be gratified, by the nomination of a governor (22) worthy only of such subjects; and the emperor, for ever renouncing the ungrateful city, proclaimed his resolution to pass the ensuing <DATE>winter</DATE> at <GPE>Tarsus</GPE> in Cilicia.
(23) The sophist Libanius.
 A.
D.
 319-390, Ec Yet <GPE>Antioch</GPE> possessed <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> citizen whose genius and virtues might atone, in the opinion of Julian, for the vice and folly of his country.
 The sophist <PERSON>Libanius</PERSON> was born in the capital of the East, he publicly professed the arts of rhetoric and declamation at Nice, Nicomedia, Constantinople, Athens, and, during the remainder of his life, at Antioch.
 His school was assiduously frequented by the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> youth; his disciples, who sometimes exceeded the number of eighty, celebrated their incomparable master; and the jealousy of his rivals, who persecuted him from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> city to another, confirmed the favourable opinion which <PERSON>Libanius</PERSON> ostentatiously displayed of his superior merit.
 The preceptors of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had extorted a rash but solemn assurance that he would never attend the lectures of their adversary; the curiosity of the royal youth was checked and inflamed; he secretly procured the writings of this dangerous sophist, and gradually surpassed, in the perfect imitation of his style, the most laborious of his domestic pupils.
(24) When <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> ascended the throne, he declared his impatience to embrace and reward the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> sophist, who had preserved in a degenerate age the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> purity of taste, of manners, and of religion.
 The emperor's prepossession was increased and justified by the discreet pride of his favourite.
 Instead of pressing, with the foremost of the crowd, into the palace of Constantinople, <PERSON>Libanius</PERSON> calmly expected his arrival at Antioch, withdrew from court on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> symptoms of coldness and indifference, required a formal invitation for each visit, and taught his sovereign an important lesson, that he might command the obedience of a subject, but that he must deserve the attachment of a friend.
 The sophists of every age, despising or affecting to despise the accidental distinctions of birth and fortune,(25) reserve their esteem for the superior qualities of the mind, with which they themselves are so plentifully endowed <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> might disdain the acclamations of a venal court who adored the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple; but he was deeply flattered by the praise, the admonition, the freedom, and the envy of an independent philosopher, who refused his favours, loved his person, celebrated his fame, and protected his memory.
 The voluminous writings of <PERSON>Libanius</PERSON> still exist; for the most part they are the vain and idle compositions of an orator who cultivated the science of words—the productions of a recluse student, whose mind, regardless of his contemporaries, was incessantly fixed on the Trojan war and the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> commonwealth.
 Yet the sophist of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> sometimes descended from this imaginary elevation; he entertained a various and elaborate correspondence;(26) he praised the virtues of his own times; he boldly arraigned the abuses of public and private life; and he eloquently pleaded the cause of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> against the just resentment of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> and Theodosius.
 It is the common calamity of old age (27) to lose whatever might have rendered it desirable; but <PERSON>Libanius</PERSON> experienced the peculiar misfortune of surviving the religion and the sciences to which he had consecrated his genius.
 The friend of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was an indignant spectator of the triumph of Christianity, and his bigotry, which darkened the prospect of the visible world, did not inspire <PERSON>Libanius</PERSON> with any lively hopes of celestial glory and happiness.
(28) March of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> to the Euphrates, A.
D.
 363, March 5 The martial impatience of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> urged him to take the field in the beginning of the spring, and he dismissed, with contempt and reproach, the senate of Antioch, who accompanied the emperor beyond the limits of their own territory, to which he was resolved never to return.
 After a laborious march of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days (29) he halted on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> at Bercea, or Aleppo, where he had the mortification of finding a senate almost entirely Christian, who received with cold and formal demonstrations of respect the eloquent sermon of the apostle of Paganism.
 The son of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of Bercea, who had embraced, either from interest or conscience, the religion of the emperor, was disinherited by his angry parent.
 The father and the son were invited to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> table.
 Julian, placing himself between them, attempted without success to inculcate the lesson and example of toleration, supported, with affected calmness, the indiscreet zeal of the aged Christian, who seemed to forget the sentiments of nature and the duty of a subject, and at length, turning towards the afflicted youth, The emperor was received in a manner much more agreeable to his wishes at Batnae, a small town pleasantly seated in a grove of cypresses, about twenty miles from the city of Hierapolis.
 The solemn rites of sacrifice were decently prepared by the inhabitants of Batnae, who seemed attached to the worship of their tutelar deities, <PERSON>Apollo</PERSON> and Jupiter; but the serious piety of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was offended by the tumult of their applause, and he clearly discerned that the smoke which arose from their altars was the incense of flattery rather than of devotion.
 The ancient and magnificent temple, which had sanctified for so many ages the city of Hierapolis,(31) no longer subsisted, and the consecrated wealth, which afforded a liberal maintenance to more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred priests, might hasten its downfall.
 Yet <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> enjoyed the satisfaction of embracing a philosopher and a friend, whose religious firmness had withstood the pressing and repeated solicitations of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> as often as those princes lodged at his house in their passage through Hierapolis.
 In the hurry of military preparation, and the careless confidence of a familiar correspondence, the zeal of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> appears to have been lively and uniform.
 He had now undertaken an important and difficult war, and the anxiety of the event rendered him still more attentive to observe and register the most trifling presages from which, according to the rules of divination, any knowledge of futurity could be derived.
 (32) He informed <PERSON>Libanius</PERSON> of his progress as far as <GPE>Hierapolis</GPE> by an elegant epistle,(33) which displays the facility of his genius and his tender friendship for the sophist of Antioch.
 His design of invading <GPE>Persia</GPE> Hierapolis, situate almost on the banks of the Euphrates,(34) had been appointed for the general rendezvous of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops, who immediately passed the great river on the bridge of boats which was previously constructed.
 (35) If the inclinations of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had been similar to those of his predecessor, he might have wasted the active and important season of the year in the circus of <EVENT>Samosata</EVENT> or in the churches of Edessa.
 But as the warlike emperor, instead of Constantius, had chosen <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> for his model, he advanced without delay to Carrhae, (36) a very ancient city of Mesopotamia, at the distance of four-score miles from Hierapolis.
 The temple of the Moon attracted the devotion of Julian, but the halt of a few days was principally employed in completing the immense preparations of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war.
 The secret of the expedition had hitherto remained in his own breast; but as <GPE>Carrhae</GPE> is the point of separation of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great roads, he could no longer conceal whether it was his design to attack the dominions of <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> on the side of the Tigris, or on that of the Euphrates.
 The emperor detached an army of thirty thousand men, under the command of his kinsman Procopius, and of Sebastian, who had been duke of Egypt.
 They were ordered to direct their march towards Nisibis, and to secure the frontier from the desultory incursions of the enemy, before they attempted the passage of the Tigris.
 Their subsequent operations were left to the discretion of the generals; but <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> expected that, after wasting with fire and sword the fertile districts of <LOC>Media</LOC> and Adiabene, they might arrive under the walls of <LOC>Ctesiphon</LOC> about the same time that he himself, advancing with equal steps along the banks of the Euphrates, should besiege the capital of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarchy.
 Disaffection of the king of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> The success of this well-concerted plan depended, in a great measure, on the powerful and ready assistance of the king of Armenia, who, without exposing the safety of his own dominions, might detach an army of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand horse and twenty thousand foot to the assistance of the Romans.
 (37) But the feeble Arsaces Tiranus,(38) king of Armenia, had degenerated still more shamefully than his father <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> from the manly virtues of the great Tiridates; and as the pusillanimous monarch was averse to any enterprise of danger and glory, he could disguise his timid indolence by the more decent excuses of religion and gratitude.
 He expressed a pious attachment to the memory of Constantius, from whose hands he had received in marriage Olympias, the daughter of the praefect Ablavius; and the alliance of a female who had been educated as the destined wife of the emperor <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> exalted the dignity of a barbarian king.
 (39) <PERSON>Tiranus</PERSON> professed the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion; he reigned over a nation of Christians; and he was restrained, by every principle of conscience and interest, from contributing to the victory which would consummate the ruin of the church.
 The alienated mind of <PERSON>Tiranus</PERSON> was exasperated by the indiscretion of Julian, who treated the king of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> as his slave, and as the enemy of the gods.
 The haughty and threatening style of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> mandates (40) awakened the secret indignation of a prince who, in the humiliating state of dependence, was still conscious of his royal descent from the Arsacides, the lords of the East, and the rivals of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> power.
 Military preparations The military dispositions of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were skilfully contrived to deceive the spies and to divert the attention of Sapor.
 The legions appeared to direct their march towards <GPE>Nisibis</GPE> and the Tigris.
 On a sudden they wheeled to the right, traversed the level and naked plain of Carrhae, and reached, on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the banks of the Euphrates, where the strong town of Nicephorium, or Callinicum, had been founded by the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> kings.
 From thence the emperor pursued his march, above ninety miles, along the winding stream of the Euphrates, till at length, about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> month after his departure from Antioch, he discovered the towers of Circesium, the extreme limit of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> dominions.
 The army of Julian, the most numerous that any of the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> had ever led against Persia, consisted of sixty-five thousand effective and well-disciplined soldiers.
 The veteran bands of cavalry and infantry, of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, had been selected from the different provinces, and a just pre-eminence of loyalty and valour was claimed by the hardy Gauls, who guarded the throne and person of their beloved prince.
 A formidable body of <NORP>Scythian</NORP> auxiliaries had been transported from another climate, and almost from another world, to invade a distant country of whose name and situation they were ignorant.
 The love of rapine and war allured to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> standard several tribes of Saracens, or roving Arabs, whose service <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had commanded, while he sternly refused the payment of the accustomed subsidies.
 The broad channel of the Euphrates(41) was crowded by a fleet of eleven hundred ships, destined to attend the motions and to satisfy the wants of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army.
 The military strength of the fleet was composed of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> armed galleys, and these were accompanied by an equal number of flat-bottomed boats, which might occasionally be connected into the form of temporary bridges.
 The rest of the ships, partly constructed of timber and partly covered with raw hides, were laden with an almost inexhaustible supply of arms and engines, of utensils and provisions.
 The vigilant humanity of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had embarked a very large magazine of vinegar and biscuit for the use of the soldiers, but he prohibited the indulgence of wine, and rigorously stopped a long string of superfluous camels that attempted to follow the rear of the army.
 The river <NORP>Chaboras</NORP> falls into the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> at Circesium, (42) and, as soon as the trumpet gave the signal of march, April 7th the <NORP>Romans</NORP> passed the little stream which separated <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> mighty and hostile empires.
 The custom of ancient discipline required a military oration, and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> embraced every opportunity of displaying his eloquence He animated the impatient and attentive legions by the example of the inflexible courage and glorious triumphs of their ancestors.
 He excited their resentment by a lively picture of the insolence of the <NORP>Persians</NORP> and he exhorted them to imitate his firm resolution either to extirpate that perfidious nation, or to devote his life in the cause of the republic.
 The eloquence of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was enforced by a donative of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and thirty pieces of silver to every soldier, and the bridge of the <NORP>Chaboras</NORP> was instantly cut away to convince the troops that they must place their hopes of safety in the success of their arms.
 Yet the prudence of the emperor induced him to secure a remote frontier, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the hostile Arabs.
 A detachment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand men was left at Circesium, which completed, to the number of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand, the regular garrison of that important fortress.
(43) His march over the desert of <GPE>Mesopotamia</GPE> From the moment that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> entered the enemy's country, (44) the country of an active and artful enemy, the order of march was disposed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> columns.
(45) The strength of the infantry, and consequently of the whole army, was placed in the centre, under the peculiar command of their master-general Victor.
 On the right, the brave <PERSON>Nevitta</PERSON> led a column of several legions along the banks of the Euphrates, and almost always in sight of the fleet.
 The left flank of the army was protected by the column of cavalry.
 <NORP>Hormisdas</NORP> and <PERSON>Arinthseus</PERSON> were appointed generals of the horse, and the singular adventures of <NORP>Hormisdas</NORP> (46) are not undeserving of our notice.
 He was a <NORP>Persian</NORP> prince, of the royal race of the Sassanides, who, in the troubles of the minority of Sapor, had escaped from prison to the hospitable court of the great Constantine.
 <NORP>Hormisdas</NORP> at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> excited the compassion, and at length acquired the esteem, of his new masters; his valour and fidelity raised him to the military honours of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> service; and, though a Christian, he might indulge the secret satisfaction of convincing his ungrateful country that an oppressed subject may prove the most dangerous enemy.
 Such was the disposition of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> principal columns.
 The front and flanks of the army were covered by <GPE>Lucilianus</GPE> with a flying detachment of fifteen hundred light-armed soldiers, whose active vigilance observed the most distant signs, and conveyed the earliest notice of any hostile approach.
 Dagalaiphus, and <GPE>Secundinus</GPE> duke of Osrhoene, conducted the troops of the rearguard; the baggage securely proceeded in the intervals of the columns; and the ranks, from a motive either of use or ostentation, were formed in such open order that the whole line of march extended almost <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> miles.
 The ordinary post of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was at the head of the centre column, but, as he preferred the duties of a general to the state of a monarch, he rapidly moved, with a small escort of light cavalry, to the front, the rear, the flanks, wherever his presence could animate or protect the march of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army.
 The country which they traversed from the <NORP>Chaboras</NORP> to the cultivated lands of <GPE>Assyria</GPE> may be considered as a part of the desert of Arabia, a dry and barren waste, which could never be improved by the most powerful arts of human industry.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> marched over the same ground which had been trod above seven hundred years before by the footsteps of the younger Cyrus, and which is described by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the companions of his expedition, the sage and heroic Xenophon.
(47) The loose sand of the desert was frequently raised by the wind into clouds of dust, and a great number of the soldiers of Julian, with their tents, were suddenly thrown to the ground by the violence of an unexpected hurricane.
 His success The sandy plains of <GPE>Mesopotamia</GPE> were abandoned to the antelopes and wild asses of the desert, but a variety of populous towns and villages were pleasantly situated on the banks of the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> and in the islands which are occasionally formed by that river.
 The city of Anah, or Anatho,(49) the actual residence of an <NORP>Arabian</NORP> emir, is composed of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> long streets, which enclose, within a natural fortification, a small island in the midst, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fruitful spots on either side, of the Euphrates.
 The warlike inhabitants of <GPE>Anatho</GPE> showed a disposition to stop the march of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor, till they were diverted from such fatal presumption by the mild exhortations of Prince Hormisdas, and the approaching terrors of the fleet and army.
 They implored and experienced the clemency of Julian, who transplanted the people to an advantageous settlement near <GPE>Chalcis</GPE> in Syria, and admitted Pusaeus, the governor, to an honourable rank in his service and friendship.
 But the impregnable fortress of <PERSON>Thilutha</PERSON> could scorn the menace of a siege, and the emperor was obliged to content himself with an insulting promise that, when he had subdued the interior provinces of Persia, <PERSON>Thilutha</PERSON> would no longer refuse to grace the triumph of the conqueror.
 The inhabitants of the open towns, unable to resist and unwilling to yield, fled with precipitation, and their houses, filled with spoil and provisions, were occupied by the soldiers of Julian, who massacred, without remorse and without punishment, some defenceless women.
 During the march the Surenas, or <NORP>Persian</NORP> general, and Malek Rodosaces, the renowned emir of the tribe of Gassan,(50) incessantly hovered round the army; every straggler was intercepted, every detachment was attacked, and the valiant <NORP>Hormisdas</NORP> escaped with some difficulty from their hands.
 But the barbarians were finally repulsed, the country became every day less favourable to the operations of cavalry, and when the <NORP>Romans</NORP> arrived at <GPE>Macepracta</GPE> they perceived the ruins of the wall which had been constructed by the ancient kings of <GPE>Assyria</GPE> to secure their dominions from the incursions of the Medes.
 These preliminaries of the expedition of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> appear to have employed about fifteen days, and we may compute near <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred miles from the fortress of <GPE>Circesium</GPE> to the wall of Macepracta.
(51) Description of <GPE>Assyria</GPE> The fertile province of <GPE>Assyria</GPE> (52) which stretched beyond the Tigris, as far as the mountains of Media,(53) extended about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred miles from the ancient wall of <GPE>Macepracta</GPE> to the territory of Basra, where the united streams of the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> and <LOC>Tigris</LOC> discharge themselves into the <NORP>Persian</NORP> Gulf.
(54) The whole country might have claimed the peculiar name of Mesopotamia, as the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rivers, which are never more distant than fifty, approach, between <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> and Babylon, within twenty-five miles of each other.
 A multitude of artificial canals, dug without much labour in a soft and yielding soil, connected the rivers and intersected the plain of Assyria.
 The uses of these artificial canals were various and important.
 They served to discharge the superfluous waters from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> river into the other at the season of their respective inundations.
 Subdividing themselves into smaller and smaller branches, they refreshed the dry lands and supplied the deficiency of rain.
 They facilitated the intercourse of peace and commerce, and, as the dam could be speedily broke down, they armed the despair of the <NORP>Assyrians</NORP> with the means of opposing a sudden deluge to the progress of an invading army.
 To the soil and climate of <GPE>Assyria</GPE> nature had denied some of her choicest gifts - the vine, the olive, and the fig-tree; but the food which supports the life of man, and particularly wheat and barley, were produced with inexhaustible fertility, and the husbandman, who committed his seed to the earth, was frequently rewarded with an increase of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or even of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred.
 The face of the country was interspersed with groves of innumerable palm-trees, (55) and the diligent natives celebrated, either in verse or prose, the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty uses to which the trunk, the branches, the leaves, the juice, and the fruit were skilfully applied.
 Several manufactures, especially those of leather and linen, employed the industry of a numerous people, and afforded valuable materials for foreign trade, which appears, however, to have been conducted by the hands of strangers.
 <GPE>Babylon</GPE> had been converted into a royal park, but near the ruins of the ancient capital new cities had successively arisen, and the populousness of the country was displayed in the multitudes of towns and villages, which were built of bricks dried in the sun and strongly cemented with bitumen, the natural and peculiar production of the <NORP>Babylonian</NORP> soil.
 While the successors of <PERSON>Cyrus</PERSON> reigned over Asia, the province of <GPE>Assyria</GPE> alone maintained, during a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> part of the year, the luxurious plenty of the table and household of the Great King.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> considerable villages were assigned for the subsistence of his <NORP>Indian</NORP> dogs; eight hundred stallions and <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> thousand mares were constantly kept, at the expense of the country, for the royal stables; and as the daily tribute which was paid to the satrap amounted to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> English bushel of silver, we may compute the annual revenue of <GPE>Assyria</GPE> at more than twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling.
 (56) Invasion of Assyria.
 A.
D.
 363.
 May.
 The fields of <GPE>Assyria</GPE> were devoted by <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> to the calamities of war; and the philosopher retaliated on a guiltless people the acts of rapine and cruelty which had been committed by their haughty master in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces.
 The trembling <NORP>Assyrians</NORP> summoned the rivers to their assistance; and completed with their own hands the ruin of their country.
 The roads were rendered impracticable; a flood of waters was poured into the camp; and, during several days, the troops of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were obliged to contend with the most discouraging hardships.
 But every obstacle was surmounted by the perseverance of the legionaries, who were inured to toil as well as to danger, and who felt themselves animated by the spirit of their leader.
 The damage was gradually repaired; the waters were restored to their proper channels; while groves of palm trees were cut down and placed along the bro ken parts of the road; and the army passed over the broad and deeper canals on bridges of floating rafts, which were supported by the help of bladders.
 Siege of Perisabor, <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> cities of <GPE>Assyria</GPE> presumed to resist the arms of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor; and they both paid the severe penalty of their rashness At the distance of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> miles from the royal residence of Ctesiphon, Perisabor, or Anbar, held the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> rank in the province: a city, large, populous, and well fortified, surrounded with a double wall, almost encompassed by a branch of the Euphrates, and defended by the valour of a numerous garrison.
 The exhortations of <NORP>Hormisdas</NORP> were repulsed with contempt; and the ears of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> prince were wounded by a just reproach, that, unmindful of his royal birth, he conducted an army of strangers against his king and country.
 The <NORP>Assyrians</NORP> maintained their loyalty by a skilful as well as vigorous defence, till the lucky stroke of a battering-ram having opened a large breach by shattering <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the angles of the wall, they hastily retired into the fortifications of the interior citadel.
 The soldiers of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> rushed impetuously into the town, and, after the full gratification of every military appetite, <GPE>Perisabor</GPE> was reduced to ashes; and the engines which assaulted the citadel were planted on the ruins of the smoking houses.
 The contest was continued by an incessant and mutual discharge of missile weapons; and the superiority which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might derive from the mechanical powers of their balistae and catapultae was counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground on the side of the besieged.
 But as soon as an <PRODUCT>Helepolis</PRODUCT> had been constructed, which could engage on equal terms with the loftiest ramparts, the tremendous aspect of a moving turret, that would leave no hope of resistance or of mercy, terrified the defenders of the citadel into an humble submission, and the place was surrendered only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days after <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> appeared under the walls of Perisabor.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred persons of both sexes, the feeble remnant of a flourishing people, were permitted to retire: the plentiful magazines of corn, of arms, and of splendid furniture, were partly distributed among the troops and partly reserved for the public service; the useless stores were destroyed by fire or thrown into the stream of the Euphrates; and the fate of <GPE>Amida</GPE> was revenged by the total ruin of Perisabor.
 of <PERSON>Maogamalcha</PERSON> The city, or rather fortress, of Maogamalcha, which was defended by <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> large towers, a deep ditch,, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> strong and solid walls of brick and bitumen, appears to have been constructed at the distance of eleven miles, as the safeguard of the capital of Persia.
 The emperor, apprehensive of leaving such an important fortress in his rear, immediately formed the siege of Maogamalcha; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army was distributed for that purpose into <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> divisions.
 Victor, at the head of the cavalry and of a detachment of heavy-armed foot, was ordered to clear the country as far as the banks of the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> and the suburbs of Ctesiphon.
 The conduct of the attack was assumed by <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> himself, who seemed to place his whole dependence in the military engines which he erected against the walls; while he secretly contrived a more efficacious method of introducing his troops into the heart of the city.
 Under the direction of <PERSON>Nevitta</PERSON> and Dagalaiphus, the trenches were opened at a considerable distance, and gradually prolonged as far as the edge of the ditch.
 The ditch was speedily filled with earth; and, by the incessant labour of the troops, a mine was carried under the foundations of the walls and sustained at sufficient intervals by props of timber.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> chosen cohorts, advancing in a single file, silently explored the dark and dangerous passage; till their intrepid leader whispered back the intelligence that he was ready to issue from his confinement into the streets of the hostile city.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> checked their ardour, that he might ensure their success; and immediately diverted the attention of the garrison by the tumult and clamour of a general assault.
 The Persians, who from their walls contemptuously beheld the progress of an impotent attack, celebrated with songs of triumph the glory of Sapor; and ventured to assure the emperor that he might ascend the starry mansion of <PERSON>Ormusd</PERSON> before he could hope to take the impregnable city of Maogamalcha.
 The city was already taken.
 History has recorded the name of a private soldier, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who ascended from the mine into a deserted tower.
 The passage was widened by his companions, who pressed forwards with impatient valour.
 Fifteen hundred enemies were already in the midst of the city.
 The astonished garrison abandoned the walls, and their only hope of safety; the gates were instantly burst open; and the revenge of the soldier, unless it were suspended by lust or avarice, was satiated by an undistinguishing massacre.
 The governor, who had yielded on a promise of mercy, was burnt alive, a few days afterwards, on a charge of having uttered some disrespectful words against the honour of Prince Hormisdas.
 The fortifications were razed to the ground; and not a vestige was left that the city of <PERSON>Maogamalcha</PERSON> had ever existed.
 The neighbourhood of the capital of <GPE>Persia</GPE> was adorned with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> stately palaces, laboriously enriched with every production that could gratify the luxury and pride of an <NORP>Eastern</NORP> monarch.
 The pleasant situation of the gardens along the banks of the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> was improved, according to the <NORP>Persian</NORP> taste, by the symmetry of flowers, fountains, and shady walks: and spacious parks were enclosed for the reception of the bears, lions, and wild boars, which were maintained at a considerable expense for the pleasure of the royal chase.
 The park-walls were broken down, the savage game was abandoned to the darts of the soldiers, and the palaces of <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> were reduced to ashes, by the command of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 Julian, on this occasion, showed himself ignorant or careless of the laws of civility, which the prudence and refinement of polished ages have established between hostile princes.
 Yet these wanton ravages need not excite in our breasts any vehement emotions of pity or resentment.
 A simple, naked statue, finished by the hand of a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> artist, is of more genuine value than all these rude and costly monuments of barbaric labour; and, if we are more deeply affected by the ruin of a palace than by the conflagration of a cottage, our humanity must have formed a very erroneous estimate of the miseries of human life.
(57) Personal behaviour of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was an object of terror and hatred to the Persians; and the painters of that nation represented the invader of their country under the emblem of a furious lion, who vomited from his mouth a consuming fire.
(58) To his friends and soldiers the philosophic hero appeared in a more amiable light; and his virtues were never more conspicuously displayed than in the last and most active period of his life.
 He practised, without effort, and almost without merit, the habitual qualities of temperance and sobriety.
 According to the dictates of that artificial wisdom which assumes an absolute dominion over the mind and body, he sternly refused himself the indulgence of the most natural appetites.
 (59) In the warm climate of Assyria, which solicited a luxurious people to the gratification of every sensual desire, (60) a youthful conqueror preserved his chastity pure and inviolate: nor was <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> ever tempted, even by a motive of curiosity, to visit his female captives of exquisite beauty,(61) who, instead of resisting his power, would have disputed with each other the honour of his embraces.
 With the same firmness that he resisted the allurements of love, he sustained the hardships of war.
 When the <NORP>Romans</NORP> marched through the flat and flooded country, their sovereign, on foot, at the head of his legions, shared their fatigues and animated their diligence.
 In every useful labour the hand of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was prompt and strenuous; and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple was wet and dirty, as the coarse garment of the meanest soldier.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sieges allowed him some remarkable opportunities of signalising his personal valour, which, in the improved state of the military art, can seldom be exerted by a prudent general.
 The emperor stood before the citadel of Perisabor, insensible of his extreme danger, and encouraged his troops to burst open the gates of iron, till he was almost overwhelmed under a cloud of missile weapons and huge stones that were directed against his person.
 As he examined the exterior fortifications of Maogamalcha, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Persians, devoting themselves for their country, suddenly rushed upon him with drawn scimitars: the emperor dexterously received their blows on his uplifted shield; and, with a steady and well-aimed thrust, laid <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his adversaries dead at his feet.
 The esteem of a prince who possesses the virtues which he approves is the noblest recompense of a deserving subject; and the authority which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> derived from his personal merit enabled him to revive and enforce the rigour of ancient discipline.
 He punished with death, or ignominy, the misbehaviour of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> troops of horse, who, in a skirmish with the Surenas, had lost their honour and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their standards: and he distinguished with obsidional(62) crowns the valour of the foremost soldiers who had ascended into the city of Maogamalcha.
 After the siege of <GPE>Perisabor</GPE> the firmness of the emperor was exercised by the insolent avarice of the army, who loudly complained that their services were rewarded by a trifling donative of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of silver.
 His just indignation was expressed in the grave and manly language of a Roman.
 The modest resolution of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was answered by the unanimous applause and cheerful obedience of the Romans, who declared their confidence of victory while they fought under the banners of their heroic prince.
 Their courage was kindled by his frequent and familiar asseverations (for such wishes were the oaths of Julian), "So may I reduce the <NORP>Persians</NORP> under the yoke!" "Thus may I restore the strength and splendour of the republic!" The love of fame was the ardent passion of his soul: but it was not before he trampled on the ruins of <PERSON>Maogamalcha</PERSON> that he allowed himself to say, "We have now provided some materials for the sophist of Antioch.
" (64) He transports his fleet from the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> to the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> The successful valour of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had triumphed over all the obstacles that opposed his march to the gates of Ctesiphon.
 But the reduction, or even the siege, of the capital of <GPE>Persia</GPE> was still at a distance: nor can the military conduct of the emperor be clearly apprehended without a knowledge of the country which was the theatre of his bold and skilful operations.
(65) Twenty miles to the south of Bagdad, and on the eastern bank of the Tigris, the curiosity of travellers has observed some ruins of the palaces of Ctesiphon, which in the time of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was a great and populous city.
 The name and glory of the adjacent <GPE>Seleucia</GPE> were for ever extinguished; and the only remaining quarter of that <NORP>Greek</NORP> colony had resumed, with the <NORP>Assyrian</NORP> language and manners, the primitive appellation of Coche.
 <PERSON>Coche</PERSON> was situate on the western side of the Tigris; but it was naturally considered as a suburb of Ctesiphon, with which we may suppose it to have been connected by a permanent bridge of boats.
 The united parts contributed to form the common epithet of Al Modain, THE CITIES, which the <NORP>Orientals</NORP> have bestowed on the <DATE>winter</DATE> residence of the Sassanides; and the whole circumference of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> capital was strongly fortified by the waters of the river, by lofty walls, and by impracticable morasses.
 Near the ruins of <GPE>Seleucia</GPE> the camp of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was fixed, and secured by a ditch and rampart against the sallies of the numerous and enterprising garrison of Coche.
 In this fruitful and pleasant country the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were plentifully supplied with water and forage: and several forts, which might have embarrassed the motions of the army, submitted, after some resistance, to the efforts of their valour.
 The fleet passed from the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> into an artificial deviation of that river, which pours a copious and navigable stream into the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> at a small distance below the great city.
 If they had followed this royal canal, which bore the name of NaharMalcha, (66) the intermediate situation of <PERSON>Coche</PERSON> would have separated the fleet and army of Julian; and the rash attempt of steering against the current of the Tigris, and forcing their way through the midst of a hostile capital, must have been attended with the total destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> navy.
 The prudence of the emperor foresaw the danger, and provided the remedy.
 As he had minutely studied the operations of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> in the same country, he soon recollected that his warlike predecessor had dug a new and navigable canal, which, leaving <PERSON>Coche</PERSON> on the right hand, conveyed the waters of the <NORP>NaharMalcha</NORP> into the river <LOC>Tigris</LOC> at some distance above the cities.
 From the information of the peasants <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> ascertained the vestiges of this ancient work, which were almost obliterated by design or accident.
 By the indefigable labour of the soldiers a broad and deep channel was speedily prepared for the reception of the Euphrates.
 A strong dyke was constructed to interrupt the ordinary current of the NaharMalcha: a flood of waters rushed impetuously into their new bed; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> fleet, steering their triumphant course into the Tigris, derided the vain and ineffectual barriers which the <NORP>Persians</NORP> of <LOC>Ctesiphon</LOC> had erected to oppose their passage.
 Passage of the Tigris, and victory of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> As it became necessary to transport the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army over the Tigris, another labour presented itself, of less toil, but of more danger, than the preceding expedition.
 The stream was broad and rapid, the ascent steep and difficult; and the entrenchments which had been formed on the ridge of the opposite bank were lined with a numerous army of heavy cuirassiers, dexterous archers, and huge elephants; who (according to the extravagant hyperbole of Libanius) could trample with the same ease a field of corn or a legion of Romans.
(67) In the presence of such an enemy the construction of a bridge was impracticable; and the intrepid prince, who instantly seized the only possible expedient, concealed his design, till the moment of execution, from the knowledge of the barbarians, of his own troops, and even of his generals themselves.
 Under the specious pretence of examining the state of the magazines, four-score vessels were gradually unladen; and a select detachment, apparently destined for some secret expedition, was ordered to stand to their arms on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> signal.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> disguised the silent anxiety of his own mind with smiles of confidence and joy; and amused the hostile nations with the spectacle of military games, which he insultingly celebrated under the walls of Coche.
 The day was consecrated to pleasure; but, as soon as the hour of supper was past, the emperor summoned the generals to his tent, and acquainted them that he had fixed that night for the passage of the Tigris.
 They stood in silent and respectful astonishment; but when the venerable <PERSON>Sallust</PERSON> assumed the privilege of his age and experience, the rest of the chiefs supported with freedom the weight of his prudent remonstrances.
(68) <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> contented himself with observing that conquest and safety depended on the attempt; that, instead of diminishing, the number of their enemies would be increased by successive reinforcements; and that a longer delay would neither contract the breadth of the stream nor level the height of the bank.
 The signal was instantly given, and obeyed: the most impatient of the legionaries leaped into <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> vessels that lay nearest to the bank; and, as they plied their oars with intrepid diligence, they were lost after a few moments in the darkness of the night.
 A flame arose on the opposite side; and Julian, who too clearly understood that his foremost vessels in attempting to land had been fired by the enemy, dexterously converted their extreme danger into a presage of victory.
 The united and rapid motion of a great fleet broke the violence of the current, and they reached the eastern shore of the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> with sufficient speed to extinguish the flames and rescue their adventurous companions.
 The difficulties of a steep and lofty ascent were increased by the weight of armour and the darkness of the night.
 A shower of stones, darts, and fire was incessantly discharged on the heads of the assailants; who, after an arduous struggle, climbed the bank and stood victorious upon the rampart.
 As soon as they possessed a more equal field, Julian, who with his light infantry had led the attack,(69) darted through the ranks a skilful and experienced eye; his bravest soldiers, according to the precepts of Homer,(70) were distributed in the front and rear; and all the trumpets of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> army sounded to battle.
 The Romans, after sending up a military shout, advanced in measured steps to the animating notes of martial music; launched their formidable javelins, and rushed forwards with drawn swords to deprive the barbarians, by a closer onset, of the advantage of their missile weapons.
 The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours; till the gradual retreat of the <NORP>Persians</NORP> was changed into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example was given by the principal leaders and the <PERSON>Surenas</PERSON> himself.
 They were pursued to the gates of Ctesiphon; and the conquerors might have entered the dismayed city,(71) if their general, Victor, who was dangerously wounded with an arrow, had not conjured them to desist from a rash attempt, which must be fatal if it were not successful.
 On their side the <NORP>Romans</NORP> acknowledged the loss of only seventy-five men; while they affirmed that the barbarians had left on the field of battle <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred, or even six thousand, of their bravest soldiers.
 The spoil was such as might be expected from the riches and luxury of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> camp; large quantities of silver and gold, splendid arms and trappings, and beds and tables of massive silver.
 The victorious emperor distributed, as the rewards of valour, some honourable gifts, civic, and mural, and naval crowns; which he, and perhaps he alone, esteemed more precious than the wealth of Asia.
 A solemn sacrifice was offered to the god of war, but the appearances of the victims threatened the most inauspicious events; and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> soon discovered, by less ambiguous signs, that he had now reached the term of his prosperity.
(72) Situation and obstinacy of Julian, A.
D.
 363.
 June.
 On the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day after the battle the domestic guards, the <NORP>Jovians</NORP> and Herculians, and the remaining troops, which composed near two-thirds of the whole army, were securely wafted over the Tigris.
 (73) While the <NORP>Persians</NORP> beheld from the walls of <LOC>Ctesiphon</LOC> the desolation of the adjacent country, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> cast many an anxious look towards the North, in full expectation that, as he himself had victoriously penetrated to the capital of Sapor, the march and junction of his lieutenants, <PERSON>Sebastian</PERSON> and Procopius, would be executed with the same courage and diligence.
 His expectations were disappointed by the treachery of the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> king, who permitted and most probably directed, the desertion of his auxiliary troops from the camp of the Romans;(74) and by the dissensions of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals, who were incapable of forming or executing any plan for the public service.
 When the emperor had relinquished the hope of this important reinforcement, he condescended to hold a council of war, and approved, after a full debate, the sentiment of those generals who dissuaded the siege of Ctesiphon, as a fruitless and pernicious undertaking.
 It is not easy for us to conceive by what arts of fortification a city thrice besieged and taken by the predecessors of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> could be rendered impregnable against an army of sixty thousand Romans, commanded by a brave and experienced general, and abundantly supplied with ships, provisions, battering engines, and military stores.
 But we may rest assured, from the love of glory, and contempt of danger, which formed the character of Julian, that he was not discouraged by any trivial or imaginary obstacles.
(75) At the very time when he declined the siege of Ctesiphon, he rejected, with obstinacy and disdain, the most flattering offers of a negotiation of peace.
 Sapor, who had been so long accustomed to the tardy ostentation of Constantius, was surprised by the intrepid diligence of his successor.
 As far as the confines of <GPE>India</GPE> and Scythia, the satraps of the distant provinces were ordered to assemble their troops, and to march, without delay, to the assistance of their monarch.
 But their preparations were dilatory, their motions slow; and before <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> could lead an army into the field, he received the melancholy intelligence of the devastation of Assyria, the ruin of his palaces, and the slaughter of his bravest troops, who defended the passage of the Tigris.
 The pride of royalty was humbled in the dust; he took his repasts on the ground; and the disorder of his hair expressed the grief and anxiety of his mind.
 Perhaps he would not have refused to purchase, with <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> half of his kingdom, the safety of the remainder; and he would have gladly subscribed himself, in a treaty of peace, the faithful and dependent ally of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> conqueror.
 Under the pretence of private business, a minister of rank and confidence was secretly despatched to embrace the knees of Hormisdas, and to request, in the language of a suppliant, that he might be introduced into the presence of the emperor.
 The <NORP>Sassanian</NORP> prince, whether he listened to the voice of pride or humanity, whether he consulted the sentiments of his birth or the duties of his situation, was equally inclined to promote a salutary measure which would terminate the calamities of Persia, and secure the triumph of Rome.
 He was astonished by the inflexible firmness of a hero who remembered, most unfortunately for himself and for his country, that <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> had uniformly rejected the propositions of Darius.
 But as <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was sensible that the hope of a safe and honourable peace might cool the ardour of his troops, he earnestly requested that <NORP>Hormisdas</NORP> would privately dismiss the minister of Sapor, and conceal this dangerous temptation from the knowledge of the camp.
(76) He burns his fleet The honour, as well as interest, of Julian, forbade him to consume his time under the impregnable walls of Ctesiphon; and as often as he defied the barbarians, who defended the city, to meet him on the open plain, they prudently replied that, if he desired to exercise his valour, he night seek the army of the Great King.
 He felt he insult, and he accepted the advice.
 Instead of confining his servile march to the banks of the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> and Tigris, he resolved to imitate the adventurous spirit of Alexander, and boldly to advance into the inland provinces, till he forced his rival to contend with him, perhaps in the plains of Arbela, for the empire of Asia.
 The magnanimity of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was applauded and betrayed by the arts of a noble Persian, who, in the cause of his country, had generously submitted to act a part full of danger, of falsehood, and of shame.
(77) With a train of faithful followers he deserted to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp; exposed, in a specious tale, the injuries which he had sustained; exaggerated the cruelty of Sapor, the discontent of the people, and the weakness of the monarchy; and confidently offered himself as the hostage and guide of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> march.
 The most rational grounds of suspicion were urged, without effect, by the wisdom and experience of Hormisdas; and the credulous Julian, receiving the traitor into his bosom, was persuaded to issue an hasty order, which, in the opinion of mankind, appeared to arraign his prudence and to endanger his safety.
 He destroyed in a single hour the whole navy, which had been transported above <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles, It so great an expense of toil, of treasure, and of blood.
 Twelve, or, at the most, twenty-two, small vessels were saved, to accompany, on carriages, the march of the army, and to form occasional bridges for the passage of the rivers.
 A supply of twenty days' provisions was preserved for the use of the soldiers; and the rest of the magazines, with a fleet of eleven hundred vessels, which rode at anchor in the Tigris, were abandoned to the flames by the absolute command of the emperor.
 The <NORP>Christian</NORP> bishops, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> and Augustin, insult the madness of the apostate, who executed, with his own hands, the sentence of divine justice.
 Their authority, of less weight, perhaps, in a military question, is confirmed by the cool judgment of an experienced soldier, who was himself spectator of the conflagration, and who could not disapprove the reluctant murmurs of the troops.
 (78) Yet there are not wanting some specious, and perhaps solid, reasons, which might justify the resolution of Julian.
 The navigation of the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> never ascended above Babylon, nor that of the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> above Opis.
(79) The distance of the last-mentioned city from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> camp was not very considerable; and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> must soon have renounced the vain and impracticable attempt of forcing upwards a great fleet against the stream of a rapid river, (80) which in several places was embarrassed by natural or artificial cataracts.
(81) The power of sails and oars was insufficient, it became necessary to tow the ships against the current of the river; the strength of twenty thousand soldiers was exhausted in this tedious and servile labour; and if the <NORP>Romans</NORP> continued to march along the banks of the Tigris, they could only expect to return home without achieving any enterprise worthy of the genius or fortune of their leader.
 If, on the contrary, it was advisable to advance into the inland country, the destruction of the fleet and magazines was the only measure which could save that valuable prize from the hands of the numerous and active troops which might suddenly be poured from the gates of Ctesiphon.
 Had the arms of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> been victorious, we should now admire the conduct as well as the courage of a hero who, by depriving his soldiers of the hopes of a retreat, left them only the alternative of death or conquest.
(82) and marches against Sapor.
 The cumbersome train of artillery and wagons, which retards the operations of a modern army, was in a great measure unknown in the camps of the Romans.
(83) Yet, in every age, the subsistence of sixty thousand men must have been <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most important cares of a prudent general; and that subsistence could only be drawn from his own or from the enemy's country.
 Had it been possible for <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> to maintain a bridge of communication on the Tigris, and to preserve the conquered places of Assyria, a desolated province could not afford any large or regular supplies in a season of the year when the lands were covered by the inundation of the Euphrates,(84) and the unwholesome air was darkened with swarms of innumerable insects.
 (85) The appearance of the hostile country was far more inviting.
 The extensive region that lies between the river <LOC>Tigris</LOC> and the mountains of <LOC>Media</LOC> was filled with villages and towns; and the fertile soils for the most part, was in a very improved state of cultivation.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> might expect that a conqueror who possessed the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> forcible instruments of persuasion, steel and gold, would easily procure a plentiful subsistence from the fears or avarice of the natives.
 But on the approach of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> this rich and smiling prospect was instantly blasted.
 Wherever they moved, the inhabitants deserted the open villages and took shelter in the fortified towns; the cattle was driven away; the grass and ripe corn were consumed with fire; and, as soon as the flames had subsided which interrupted the march of Julian, he beheld the melancholy face of a smoking and naked desert.
 This desperate but effectual method of defence can only be executed by the enthusiasm of a people who prefer their independence to their property; or by the rigour of an arbitrary government, which consults the public safety without submitting to their inclinations the liberty of choice.
 On the present occasion the zeal and obedience of the <NORP>Persians</NORP> seconded the commands of Sapor; and the emperor was soon reduced to the scanty stock of provisions which continually wasted in his hands.
 Before they were entirely consumed he might still have reached the wealthy and unwarlike cities of <GPE>Ecbatana</GPE> or <PERSON>Susa</PERSON> by the effort of a rapid and well-directed march; (86) but he was deprived of this last resource by his ignorance of the roads and by the perfidy of his guides.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> wandered several days in the country to the eastward of Bagdad; the <NORP>Persian</NORP> deserter, who had artfully led them into the snare, escaped from their resentment; and his followers, as soon as they were put to the torture, confessed the secret of the conspiracy.
 The visionary conquests of <GPE>Hyrcania</GPE> and India, which had so long amused, now tormented, the mind of Julian.
 Conscious that his own imprudence was the cause of the public distress, he anxiously balanced the hopes of safety or success without obtaining a satisfactory answer either from gods or men.
 At length, as the only practicable measure, he embraced the resolution of directing his steps towards the banks of the Tigris, with the design of saving the army by a hasty march to the confines of Corduene, a fertile and friendly province, which acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 The desponding troops obeyed the signal of retreat, only seventy days <DATE>June</DATE> 16after they had passed the <NORP>Chaboras</NORP> with the sanguine expectation of subverting the throne of Persia.
(87) Retreat and distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army As long as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> seemed to advance into the country, their march was observed and insulted from a distance by several bodies of <NORP>Persian</NORP> cavalry; who, showing themselves, sometimes in loose, and sometimes in closer order faintly skirmished with the advanced guards.
 These detachments were, however, supported; by a much greater force; and the heads of the columns were no sooner pointed towards the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> than a cloud of dust arose on the plain.
 The Romans, who now aspired only to the permission of a safe and speedy retreat, endeavoured to persuade themselves that this formidable appearance was occasioned by a troop of wild asses, or perhaps by the approach of some friendly Arabs.
 They halted, pitched their tents, fortified their camp, passed the whole night in continual alarms; and discovered at the dawn of day that they were surrounded by an army of Persians.
 This army, which might be considered only as the van of the barbarians, was soon followed by the main body of cuirassiers, archers, and elephants, commanded by Meranes, a general of rank and reputation.
 He was accompanied by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of the king's sons and many of the principal satraps; and fame and expectation exaggerated the strength of the remaining powers, which slowly advanced under the conduct of <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> himself.
 As the <NORP>Romans</NORP> continued their march, their long array, which was forced to bend or divide, according to the varieties of the ground, afforded frequent and favourable opportunities to their vigilant enemies.
 The <NORP>Persians</NORP> repeatedly charged with fury; they were repeatedly repulsed with firmness; and the action at Maronga, which almost deserved the name of a battle, was marked by a considerable loss of satraps and elephants, perhaps of equal value in the eyes of their monarch.
 These splendid advantages were not obtained without an inadequate slaughter on the side of the Romans: several officers of distinction were either killed or wounded; and the emperor himself, who, on all occasions of danger, inspired and guided the valour of his troops, was obliged to expose his person and exert his abilities.
 The weight of offensive and defensive arms, which still constituted the strength and safety of the Romans, disabled them from making any long or effectual pursuit; and as the horsemen of the <LOC>East</LOC> were trained to dart their javelins and shoot their arrows at full speed, and in every possible direction,(88) the cavalry of <GPE>Persia</GPE> was never more formidable than in the moment of a rapid and disorderly flight.
 But the most certain and irreparable loss of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was that of time.
 The hardy veterans, accustomed to the cold climate of <GPE>Gaul</GPE> and Germany, fainted under the sultry heat of an <NORP>Assyrian</NORP> summer; their vigour was exhausted by the incessant repetition of march and combat; and the progress of the army was suspended by the precautions of a slow and dangerous retreat in the presence of an active enemy.
 Every day, every hour, as the supply diminished, the value and price of subsistence increased in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> camp.
 (89) Julian, who always contented himself with such food as a hungry soldier would have disdained, distributed, for the use of the troops, the provisions of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> household, and whatever could be spared from the sumpter-horses of the tribunes and generals.
 But this feeble relief served only to aggravate the sense of the public distress; and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> began to entertain the most gloomy apprehensions that, before they could reach the frontiers of the empire, they should all perish, either by famine or by the sword of the barbarians.
(90) <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> is mortally wounded.
 While <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> struggled with the almost insuperable difficulties of his situation, the silent hours of the night were still devoted to study and contemplation.
 Whenever he closed his eyes in short and interrupted slumbers, his mind was agitated with painful anxiety: nor can it be thought surprising that the Genius of the empire should once more appear before him, covering with a funeral veil his head and his horn of abundance, and slowly retiring from the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> tent.
 The monarch started from his couch, and, stepping forth to refresh his wearied spirits with the coolness of the midnight air, he beheld a fiery meteor, which shot athwart the sky, and suddenly vanished.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was convinced that he had seen the menacing countenance of the god of war; (91) the council which he summoned, of Tuscan Haruspices,(92) unanimously pronounced that he should abstain from action; but, on this occasion, necessity and reason were more prevalent than superstition; and the trumpets sounded at the break of day.
 The army marched through a hilly country and the hills had been secretly occupied by the Persians.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> led the van with the skill and attention of a consummate general; he was alarmed by the intelligence that his rear was suddenly attacked.
 The heat of the weather had tempted him to lay aside his cuirass; but he snatched a shield from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his attendants, and hastened, with a sufficient reinforcement, to the relief of the rear guard.
 A similar danger recalled the intrepid prince to the defence of the front; and, as he galloped between the columns, the centre of the left was attacked, and almost overpowered, by a furious charge of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> cavalry and elephants.
 This huge body was soon defeated by the well-timed evolution of the light infantry, who aimed their weapons, with dexterity and effect, against the backs of the horsemen, and the legs of the elephants.
 The barbarians fled: and Julian, who was foremost in every danger, animated the pursuit with his voice and gestures.
 His trembling guards, scattered and oppressed by the disorderly.
 throng of friends and enemies, reminded their fearless sovereign that he was without armour; and conjured him to decline the fall of the impending ruin.
 As they exclaimed,(93) a cloud of darts and arrows was discharged from the flying squadrons, and a javelin, after razing the skin of his arm, transpierced the ribs, and fixed in the inferior part of the liver.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> attempted to draw the deadly weapon from his side; but his fingers were cut by the sharpness of the steel, and he fell senseless from his horse.
 His guards flew to his relief; and the wounded emperor was gently raised from the ground, and conveyed out of the tumult of the battle into an adjacent tent.
 The report of the melancholy event passed from rank to rank; but the grief of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> inspired them with invincible valour, and the desire of revenge.
 The bloody and obstinate conflict was maintained by the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies till they were separated by the total darkness of the night.
 The <NORP>Persians</NORP> derived some honour from the advantage which they obtained against the left wing, where Anatolius, master of the offices, was slain, and the praefect <PERSON>Sallust</PERSON> very narrowly escaped.
 But the event of the day was adverse to the barbarians.
 They abandoned the field; their <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals, <PERSON>Meranes</PERSON> and Nohordates, (94) <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> nobles or satraps, and a multitude of their bravest soldiers [were slain]: and the success of the Romans, if <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had survived, might have been improved into a decisive and useful victory.
 The death of Julian, A.
D.
 363.
 <DATE>June</DATE> 26.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> words that <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> uttered, after his recovery from the fainting fit into which he had been thrown by loss of blood, were expressive of his martial spirit.
 He called for his horse and arms, and was impatient to rush into the battle.
 His remaining strength was exhausted by the painful effort; and the surgeons, who examined his wound, discovered the symptoms of approaching death.
 He employed the awful moments with the firm temper of a hero and a sage; the philosophers who had accompanied him in this fatal expedition compared the tent of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> with the prison of Socrates; and the spectators, whom duty, or friendship, or curiosity, had assembled round his couch, listened with respectful grief to the funeral oration of their dying emperor.
(95) After this discourse, which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> pronounced in a firm and gentle tone of voice, he distributed, by a military testament, (97) the remains of his private fortune; and making some inquiry why <PERSON>Anatolius</PERSON> was not present, he understood, from the answer of Sallust, that <PERSON>Anatolius</PERSON> was killed; and bewailed, with amiable inconsistency, the loss of his friend.
 At the same time he reproved the immoderate grief of the spectators; and conjured them not to disgrace, by unmanly tears, the fate of a prince who in a few moments would be united with heaven and with the stars.
 (98) The spectators were silent; and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> entered into a metaphysical argument with the philosophers <PERSON>Priscus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> on the nature of the soul.
 The efforts which he made, of mind as well as body, most probably hastened his death.
 His wound began to bleed with fresh violence: his respiration was embarrassed by the swelling of the veins: he called for a draught of cold water, and, as soon as he had drunk it, expired without pain, about the hour of midnight.
 Such was the end of that extraordinary man, in the thirty-second year of his age, after a reign of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> year and about eight months from the death of Constantius.
 In his last moments he displayed, perhaps with some ostentation, the love of virtue and of fame, which had been the ruling passions of his life.
 (99) Election of the emperor Jovian, A.
D.
 363, <DATE>June</DATE> 27.
 The triumph of Christianity, and the calamities of the empire, may, in some measure, be ascribed to <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> himself, who had neglected to secure the future execution of his designs by the timely and judicious nomination of an associate and successor.
 But the royal race of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> Chlorus was reduced to his own person; and if he entertained any serious thoughts of investing with the purple the most worthy among the Romans, he was diverted from his resolution by the difficulty of the choice, the jealousy of power, the fear of ingratitude, and the natural presumption of health, of youth, and of prosperity.
 His unexpected death left the empire without a master, and without an heir, in a state of perplexity and danger which, in the space of four-score years, had never been experienced, since the election of Diocletian.
 In a government which had almost forgotten the distinction of pure and noble blood, the superiority of birth was of little moment; the claims of official rank were accidental and precarious; and the candidates who might aspire to ascend the vacant throne could be supported only by the consciousness of personal merit, or by the hopes of popular favour.
 But the situation of a famished army, encompassed on all sides by an host of barbarians, shortened the moments of grief and deliberation.
 In this scene of terror and distress, the body of the deceased prince, according to his own directions, was decently embalmed; and, at the dawn of day, the generals convened a military senate, at which the commanders of the legions, and the officers both of cavalry and infantry, were invited to assist.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hours of the night had not passed away without some secret cabals; and when the election of an emperor was proposed, the spirit of faction began to agitate the assembly.
 <PERSON>Victor</PERSON> and <PERSON>Arinthaeus</PERSON> collected the remains of the court of Constantius; the friends of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> attached themselves to the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> chiefs <PERSON>Dagalaiphus</PERSON> and Nevitta; and the most fatal consequences might be apprehended from the discord of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions, so opposite in their character and interest, in their maxims of government, and perhaps in their religious principles.
 The superior virtues of <PERSON>Sallust</PERSON> could alone reconcile their divisions and unite their suffrages; and the venerable praefect would immediately have been declared the successor of Julian, if he himself, with sincere and modest firmness, had not alleged his age and infirmities, so unequal to the weight of the diadem.
 The generals, who were surprised and perplexed by his refusal, showed some disposition to adopt the salutary advice of an inferior officer,(100) that they should act as they would have acted in the absence of the emperor; that they should exert their abilities to extricate the army from the present distress; and, if they were fortunate enough to reach the confines of Mesopotamia, they should proceed with united and deliberate counsels in the election of a lawful sovereign.
 While they debated, a few voices saluted Jovian, who was no more than <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> (101) of the domestics, with the names of Emperor and Augustus.
 The tumultuary acclamation was instantly repeated by the guards who surrounded the tent, and passed, in a few minutes, to the extremities of the line.
 The new prince, astonished with his own fortune, was hastily invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ornaments, and received an oath of fidelity from the generals, whose favour and protection he so lately solicited The strongest recommendation of <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> was the merit of his father, Count Varronian, who enjoyed, in honourable retirement, the fruit of his long services.
 In the obscure freedom of a private station, the son indulged his taste for wine and women; yet he supported, with credit, the character of a Christian(102) and a soldier.
 Without being conspicuous for any of the ambitious qualifications which excite the admiration and envy of mankind, the comely person of Jovian, his cheerful temper, and familiar wit, had gained the affection of his fellow soldiers and the generals of both parties acquiesced in a popular election which had not been conducted by the arts of their enemies.
 The pride of this unexpected elevation was moderated by the just apprehension that the same day might terminate the life and reign of the new emperor.
 The pressing voice of necessity was obeyed without delay; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> orders issued by Jovian, a few hours after his predecessor had expired, were to prosecute a march which could alone extricate the <NORP>Romans</NORP> from their actual distress.
(103) Danger and difficulty of the retreat The esteem of an enemy is more sincerely expressed by his fears; and the degree of fear may be accurately measured by the joy with which he celebrates his deliverance.
 <DATE>June</DATE> 27th—July 1stThe welcome news of the death of Julian, which a deserter revealed to the camp of Sapor, inspired the desponding monarch with a sudden confidence of victory.
 He immediately detached the royal cavalry, perhaps the <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand Immortals, (104) to <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and support the pursuit and discharged the whole weight of his united forces on the rearguard of the Romans.
 The rearguard was thrown into disorder; the renowned legions, which derived their title from <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and his warlike colleague, were broke and trampled down by the elephants; and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> tribunes lost their lives in attempting to stop the flight of their soldiers.
 The battle was at length restored by the persevering valour of the Romans; the <NORP>Persians</NORP> were repulsed with a great slaughter of men and elephants; and the army, after marching and fighting a long summer's day, arrived, in the evening, at Samara, on the banks of the Tigris, about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles above Ctesiphon.
 (105) On the ensuing day the barbarians, instead of harassing the march, attacked the camp of Jovian, which had been seated in a deep and sequestered valley.
 From the hills, the archers of <GPE>Persia</GPE> insulted and annoyed the wearied legionaries; and a body of cavalry, which had penetrated with desperate courage through the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> gate, was cut in pieces, after a doubtful conflict, near the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> tent.
 In the succeeding night the camp of <GPE>Carche</GPE> was protected by the lofty dykes of the river; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army, though incessantly exposed to the vexatious pursuit of the Saracens, pitched their tents near the city of <ORG>Dura</ORG> (106) <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> days after the death of Julian.
 The <LOC>Tigris</LOC> was still on their left; their hopes and provisions were almost consumed; and the impatient soldiers, who had fondly persuaded themselves that the frontiers of the empire were not far distant, requested their new sovereign that they might be permitted to hazard the passage of the river.
 With the assistance of his wisest officers, <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> endeavoured to check their rashness, by representing that, if they possessed sufficient skill and vigour to stem the torrent of a deep and rapid stream, they would only deliver themselves naked and defenceless to the barbarians; who had occupied the opposite banks.
 Yielding at length to their clamorous importunities, he consented, with reluctance, that <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Gauls</NORP> and Germans, accustomed from their infancy to the waters of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and Danube, should attempt the bold adventure, which might serve either as an encouragement or as a warning for the rest of the army.
 In the silence of the night they swam the Tigris, surprised an unguarded post of the enemy, and displayed at the dawn of day the signal of their resolution and fortune.
 The success of this trial disposed the emperor to listen to the promises of his architects, who proposed to construct a floating bridge of the inflated skins of sheep, oxen, and goats, covered with a floor of earth and fascines.
(107) <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> important days were spent in the ineffectual labour; and the Romans, who already endured the miseries of famine, cast a look of despair on the Tigris, and upon the barbarians, whose numbers and obstinacy increased with the distress of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> army.
(108) Negotiation and treaty of peace.
 July.
 In this hopeless situation, the fainting spirits of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were revived by the sound of peace.
 The transient presumption of <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> had vanished: he observed, with serious concern, that, in the repetition of doubtful combats, he had lost his most faithful and intrepid nobles, his bravest troops, and the greatest part of his tram of elephants: and the experienced monarch feared to provoke the resistance of despair, the vicissitudes of fortune, and the unexhausted powers of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, which might soon advance to relieve, or to revenge, the successor of Julian.
 The <PERSON>Surenas</PERSON> himself, accompanied by another satrap, appeared in the camp of Jovian,(109) and declared that the clemency of his sovereign was not averse to signify the conditions on which he would consent to spare and to dismiss the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> with the relics of his captive army.
 The hopes of safety subdued the firmness of the Romans; the emperor was compelled, by the advice of his council and the cries of the soldiers, to embrace the offer of peace; and the praefect <PERSON>Sallust</PERSON> was immediately sent, with the general Arinthecus, to understand the pleasure of the Great King.
 The crafty <NORP>Persian</NORP> delayed, under various pretences, the conclusion of the agreement; started difficulties, required explanations, suggested expedients, receded from his concessions, increased his demands, and wasted <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> days in the arts of negotiation, till he had consumed the stock of provisions which yet remained in the camp of the Romans.
 Had <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> been capable of executing a bold and prudent measure, he would have continued his march with unremitting diligence; the progress of the treaty would have suspended the attacks of the barbarians; and, before the expiration of the fourth day, he might have safely reached the fruitful province of Corduene, at the distance only of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 (110) The irresolute emperor, instead of breaking through the toils of the enemy, expected his fate with patient resignation; and accepted the humiliating conditions of peace which it was no longer in his power to refuse.
 The <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> provinces beyond the Tigris, which had been ceded by the grandfather of Sapor, were restored to the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarchy.
 He acquired, by a single article, the impregnable city of Nisibis, which had sustained, in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> successive sieges, the effort of his arms.
 <GPE>Singara</GPE> and the castle of the Moors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the strongest places of Mesopotamia, were likewise dismembered from the empire.
 It was considered as an indulgence that the inhabitants of those fortresses were permitted to retire with their effects; but the conqueror rigorously insisted that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> should for ever abandon the king and kingdom of Armenia.
 A peace, or rather a long truce, of thirty years, was stipulated between the hostile nations; the faith of the treaty was ratified by solemn oaths and religious ceremonies; and hostages of distinguished rank were reciprocally delivered to secure the performance of the condition.
(111) The weakness and disgrace of <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> The sophist of Antioch, who saw with indignation the sceptre of his hero in the feeble hand of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> successor, professes to admire the moderation of <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> in contenting himself with so small a portion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 If he had stretched as far as the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> the claims of his ambition, he might have been secure, says Libanius, of not meeting with a refusal.
 If he had fixed, as the boundary of Persia, the Orontes, the Cydnus, the Sangarius, or even the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> Bosphorus, flatterers would not have been wanting in the court of <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> to convince the timid monarch that his remaining provinces would still afford the most ample gratifications of power and luxury.
(112) Without adopting in its full force this malicious insinuation, we must acknowledge that the conclusion of so ignominious a treaty was facilitated by the private ambition of Jovian.
 The obscure domestic, exalted to the throne by fortune, rather than by merit, was impatient to escape from the hands of the Persians, that he might prevent the designs of Procopius, who commanded the army of Mesopotamia, and establish his doubtful reign over the legions and provinces which were still ignorant of the hasty and tumultuous choice of the camp beyond the Tigris.
(113) In the neighbourhood of the same river, at no very considerable distance from the fatal station of Dura, (114) the <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand Greeks, without generals, or guides, or provisions, were abandoned, above twelve hundred miles from their native country, to the resentment of a victorious monarch.
 The difference of their conduct and success depended much more on their character than on their situation.
 Instead of tamely resigning themselves to the secret deliberations and private views of a single person, the united councils of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were inspired by the generous enthusiasm of a popular assembly, where the mind of each citizen is filled with the love of glory, the pride of freedom, and the contempt of death.
 Conscious of their superiority over the barbarians in arms and discipline, they disdained to yield, they refused to capitulate: every obstacle was surmounted by their patience, courage, and military skill; and the memorable retreat of the <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand exposed and insulted the weakness of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarchy.
(115) He continues his retreat to <GPE>Nisibis</GPE> As the price of his disgraceful concessions, the emperor might perhaps have stipulated that the camp of the hungry <NORP>Romans</NORP> should be plentifully supplied, (116) and that they should be permitted to pass the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> on the bridge which was constructed by the hands of the Persians.
 But if <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> presumed to solicit those equitable terms, they were sternly refused by the haughty tyrant of the East, whose clemency had pardoned the invaders of his country.
 The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> sometimes intercepted the stragglers on the march; but the generals and troops of <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> respected the cessation of arms, and <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> was suffered to explore the most convenient place for the passage of the river.
 The small vessels which had been saved from the conflagration of the fleet performed the most essential service.
 They <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conveyed the emperor and his favourites, and afterwards transported, in many successive voyages, a great part of the army.
 But as every man was anxious for his personal safety and apprehensive of being left on the hostile shore, the soldiers, who were too impatient to wait the slow returns of the boats, boldly ventured themselves on light hurdles or inflated skins, and drawing after them their horses, attempted, with various success, to swim across the river.
 Many of these daring adventurers were swallowed by the waves; many others, who were carried along by the violence of the stream, fell an easy prey to the avarice or cruelty of the wild Arabs; and the loss which the army sustained in the passage of the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> was not inferior to the carnage of a day of battle.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had landed on the western bank, they were delivered from the hostile pursuit of the barbarians; but in a laborious march of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred miles over the plains of <GPE>Mesopotamia</GPE> they endured the last extremities of thirst and hunger.
 They were obliged to traverse a sandy desert, which, in the extent of seventy miles, did not afford a single blade of sweet grass nor a single spring of fresh water, and the rest of the inhospitable waste was untrod by the footsteps either of friend or enemies.
 Whenever a small measure of flour could be discovered in the camp, twenty pounds weight were greedily purchased with <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, (117) the beasts of burden were slaughtered and devoured, and the desert was strewed with the arms and baggage of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> soldiers, whose tattered garments and meagre countenances displayed their past sufferings and actual misery.
 A small convoy of provisions advanced to meet the army as far as the castle of Ur; and the supply was the more grateful, since it declared the fidelity of <PERSON>Sebastian</PERSON> and Procopius.
 At <GPE>Thilsaphata</GPE> (118) the emperor most graciously received the generals of Mesopotamia, and the remains of a once flourishing army at length reposed themselves under the walls of Nisibis.
 The messengers of <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> had already proclaimed, in the language of flattery, his election, his treaty, and his return, and the new prince had taken the most effectual measures to secure the allegiance of the armies and provinces of <LOC>Europe</LOC> by placing the military command in the hands of those officers who, from motives of interest or inclination, would firmly support the cause of their benefactor.
(119) Universal clamour against the treaty of peace The friends of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had confidently announced the success of his expedition.
 They entertained a fond persuasion that the temples of the gods would be enriched with the spoils of the East; that <GPE>Persia</GPE> would be reduced to the humble state of a tributary province, governed by the laws and magistrates of Rome; that the barbarians would adopt the dress, and manners, and language of their conquerors; and that the youth of <GPE>Ecbatana</GPE> and <PERSON>Susa</PERSON> would study the art of rhetoric under <NORP>Grecian</NORP> masters.
(120) The progress of the arms of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> interrupted his communication with the empire, and, from the moment that he passed the Tigris, his affectionate subjects were ignorant of the fate and fortunes of their prince.
 Their contemplation of fancied triumphs was disturbed by the melancholy rumour of his death, and they persisted to doubt, after they could no longer deny, the truth of that fatal event.
 (121) The messengers of <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> promulgated the specious tale of a prudent and necessary peace; the voice of fame, louder and more sincere, revealed the disgrace of the emperor and the conditions of the ignominious treaty.
 The minds of the people were filled with astonishment and grief, with indignation and terror, when they were informed that the unworthy successor of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> relinquished the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> provinces which had been acquired by the victory of Galerius, and that he shamefully surrendered to the barbarians the important city of Nisibis, the firmest bulwark of the provinces of the <LOC>East.
</LOC> (122) The deep and dangerous question, how far the public faith should be observed when it becomes incompatible with the public safety, was freely agitated in popular conversation, and some hopes were entertained that the emperor would redeem his pusillanimous behaviour by a splendid act of patriotic perfidy.
 The inflexible spirit of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate had always disclaimed the unequal conditions which were extorted from the distress of her captive armies; and, if it were necessary to satisfy the national honour by delivering the guilty general into the hands of the barbarians, the greatest part of the subjects of <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> would have cheerfully acquiesced in the precedent of ancient times.
(123) <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> evacuates Nisibis, and restores the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> provinces to the Persians.
 But the emperor, whatever might be the limits of his constitutional authority, was the absolute master of the laws and arms of the state; and the same motives which had forced him to subscribe now pressed him to execute the treaty of peace.
 <DATE>August</DATE> He was impatient to secure an empire at the expense of a few provinces, and the respectable names of religion and honour concealed the personal fears and the ambition of <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> Notwithstanding the dutiful solicitations of the inhabitants, decency, as well as prudence, forbade the emperor to lodge in the palace of Nisibis; but the next morning after his arrival, Bineses, the ambassador of Persia, entered the place, displayed from the citadel the standard of the Great King, and proclaimed, in his name, the cruel alternative of exile or servitude.
 The principal citizens of Nisibis, who till that fatal moment, had confided in the protection of their sovereign, threw themselves at his feet.
 They conjured him not to abandon, or at least not to deliver, a faithful colony to the rage of a barbarian tyrant, exasperated by the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> successive defeats which he had experienced under the walls of Nisibis.
 They still possessed arms and courage to repel the invaders of their country; they requested only the permission of using them in their own defence, and, as soon as they had asserted their independence, they should implore the favour of being again admitted into the rank of his subjects.
 Their arguments, their eloquence, their tears, were ineffectual.
 <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> alleged, with some confusion, the sanctity of oaths; and as the reluctance with which he accepted the present of a crown of gold convinced the citizens of their hopeless condition, the advocate <PERSON>Sylvanus</PERSON> was provoked to exclaim, "O emperor! may you thus be crowned by all the cities of your dominions!" Jovian, who in a few weeks had assumed the habits of a prince, (124) was displeased with freedom, and offended with truth; and as he reasonably supposed that the discontent of the people might incline them to submit to the <NORP>Persian</NORP> government, he published an edict, under pain of death, that they should leave the city within the term of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days.
 <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> has delineated in lively colours the scene of universal despair, which he seems to have viewed with an eye of compassion.
(125) The martial youth deserted, with indignant grief, the walls which they had so gloriously defended; the disconsolate mourner dropped a last tear over the tomb of a son or husband, which must soon be profaned by the rude hand of a barbarian master; and the aged citizen kissed the threshold and clung to the doors of the house where he had passed the cheerful and careless hours of infancy.
 The highways were crowded with a trembling multitude; the distinctions of rank, and sex, and age, were lost in the general calamity.
 Every <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> strove to bear away some fragment from the wreck of his fortunes; and as they could not command the immediate service of an adequate number of horses or wagons, they were obliged to leave behind them the greatest part of their valuable effects.
 The savage insensibility of <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> appears to have aggravated the hardships of these unhappy fugitives.
 They were seated, however, in a new built quarter of Amida; and that rising city, With the reinforcement of a very considerable colony, soon recovered its former splendour and became the capital of Mesopotamia.

 The predecessors of <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> had sometimes relinquished the dominion of distant and unprofitable provinces; but, since the foundation of the city, the genius of Rome, the god Terminus, who guarded the boundaries of the republic, had never retired before the sword of a victorious enemy.
(127) Reflections on the death, After <PERSON>Jovian</PERSON> had performed those engagements which the voice of his people might have tempted him to violate, he hastened away from the scene of his disgrace, and proceeded with his whole court to enjoy the luxury of Antioch.
(128) Without consulting the dictates of religious zeal, he was prompted, by humanity and gratitude, to bestow the last honours on the remains of his deceased sovereign;(129) and Procopius, who sincerely bewailed the loss of his kinsman, was removed from the command of the army, under the decent pretence of conducting the funeral.
 The corpse of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was transported from <GPE>Nisibis</GPE> to Tarsus, in a slow march of fifteen days, and, as it passed through the cities of the East, was saluted by the hostile factions with mournful lamentations and clamorous insults.
 The <NORP>Pagans</NORP> already placed their beloved hero in the rank of those gods whose worship he had restored while the invectives of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> pursued the soul of the apostate to hell, and his body to the grave.
(130) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> party lamented the approaching ruin of their altars, the other celebrated the marvellous deliverance of the church.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> applauded, in lofty and ambiguous strains, the stroke of divine vengeance which had been so long suspended over the guilty head of Julian.
 They acknowledged that the death of the tyrant, at the instant he expired beyond the Tigris, was revealed to the saints of Egypt, Syria, and <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> ;(131) and instead of suffering him to fall by the <NORP>Persian</NORP> darts, their indiscretion ascribed the heroic deed to the obscure hand of some mortal or immortal champion of the faith.
(132) Such imprudent declarations were eagerly adopted by the malice or credulity of their adversaries, (133) who darkly insinuated or confidently asserted that the governors of the church had instigated and directed the fanaticism of a domestic assassin.
(134) Above <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> years after the death of Julian, the charge was solemnly and vehemently urged in a public oration addressed by <PERSON>Libanius</PERSON> to the emperor Theodosius.
 His suspicions are unsupported by fact or argument, and we can only esteem the generous zeal of the sophist of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> for the cold and neglected ashes of his friend.
(135) and funeral of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> It was an ancient custom in the funerals, as well as in the triumphs of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> that the voice of praise should be corrected by that of satire and ridicule, and that, in the midst of the splendid pageants which displayed the glory of the living or of the dead, their imperfections should not be concealed from the eyes of the world.
(136) This custom was practised in the funeral of Julian.

 His various character and singular manners afforded an ample scope for pleasantry and ridicule.
(137) In the exercise of his uncommon talents he often descended below the majesty of his rank.
 <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> was transformed into Diogenes—the philosopher was degraded into a priest.
 The purity of his virtue was sullied by excessive vanity; his superstition disturbed the peace and endangered the safety of a mighty empire; and his irregular sallies were the less entitled to indulgence, as they appeared to be the laborious efforts of art, or even of affectation.
 The remains of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were interred at <GPE>Tarsus</GPE> in Cilicia; but his stately tomb, which arose in that city on the banks of the cold and limpid Cydnus, (138) was displeasing to the faithful friends who loved and revered the memory of that extraordinary man.
 The philosopher expressed a very reasonable wish that the disciple of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> might have reposed amidst the groves of the Academy,(139) while the soldier exclaimed, in bolder accents, that the ashes of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> should have been mingled with those of Caesar, in the field of Mars, and among the ancient monuments of <NORP>Roman</NORP> virtue.
 (140) The history of princes does not very frequently renew the example of a similar competition.
