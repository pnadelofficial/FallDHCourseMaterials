 527-565 Our estimate of personal merit, is relative to the common faculties of mankind.
 The aspiring efforts of genius, or virtue, either in active or speculative life, are measured, not so much by their real elevation, as by the height to which they ascend above the level of their age and country; and the same stature, which in a people of giants would pass unnoticed, must appear conspicuous in a race of pygmies.
 Leonidas, and his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred companions, devoted their lives at Thermopylae; but the education of the infant, the boy, and the man, had prepared, and almost insured, this memorable sacrifice; and each <NORP>Spartan</NORP> would approve, rather than admire, an act of duty, of which himself and <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of his fellow-citizens were equally capable.
 (1) The great <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> might inscribe on his trophies, that he had defeated in battle <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of enemies, and reduced fifteen hundred cities from the Lake Maeotis to the Red Sea: (2) but the fortune of <GPE>Rome</GPE> flew before his eagles; the nations were oppressed by their own fears, and the invincible legions which he commanded, had been formed by the habits of conquest and the discipline of ages.
 In this view, the character of <GPE>Belisarius</GPE> may be deservedly placed above the heroes of the ancient republics.
 His imperfections flowed from the contagion of the times; his virtues were his own, the free gift of nature or reflection; he raised himself without a master or a rival; and so inadequate were the arms committed to his hand, that his sole advantage was derived from the pride and presumption of his adversaries.
 Under his command, the subjects of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> often deserved to be called Romans: but the unwarlike appellation of <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was imposed as a term of reproach by the haughty Goths; who affected to blush, that they must dispute the kingdom of <GPE>Italy</GPE> with a nation of tragedians pantomimes, and pirates.
 (3) The climate of <LOC>Asia</LOC> has indeed been found less congenial than that of <LOC>Europe</LOC> to military spirit: those populous countries were enervated by luxury, despotism, and superstition; and the monks were more expensive and more numerous than the soldiers of the East.
 The regular force of the empire had once amounted to <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-five <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men: it was reduced, in the time of Justinian, to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and fifty thousand; and this number, large as it may seem, was thinly scattered over the sea and land; in <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Italy, in <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Egypt, on the banks of the Danube, the coast of the Euxine, and the frontiers of Persia.
 The citizen was exhausted, yet the soldier was unpaid; his poverty was mischievously soothed by the privilege of rapine and indolence; and the tardy payments were detained and intercepted by the fraud of those agents who usurp, without courage or danger, the emoluments of war.
 Public and private distress recruited the armies of the state; but in the field, and still more in the presence of the enemy, their numbers were always defective.
 The want of national spirit was supplied by the precarious faith and disorderly service of <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> mercenaries.
 Even military honour, which has often survived the loss of virtue and freedom, was almost totally extinct.
 The generals, who were multiplied beyond the example of former times, labored only to prevent the success, or to sully the reputation of their colleagues; and they had been taught by experience, that if merit sometimes provoked the jealousy, error, or even guilt, would obtain the indulgence, of a gracious emperor.
 (4) In such an age, the triumphs of Belisarius, and afterwards of Narses, shine with incomparable lustre; but they are encompassed with the darkest shades of disgrace and calamity.
 While the lieutenant of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> subdued the kingdoms of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Vandals, the emperor, (5) timid, though ambitious, balanced the forces of the Barbarians, fomented their divisions by flattery and falsehood, and invited by his patience and liberality the repetition of injuries.
 (6) The keys of Carthage, Rome, and Ravenna, were presented to their conqueror, while <GPE>Antioch</GPE> was destroyed by the Persians, and <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> trembled for the safety of Constantinople.
 State of the Barbarians.
 Even the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> victories of <GPE>Belisarius</GPE> were prejudicial to the state, since they abolished the important barrier of the Upper Danube, which had been so faithfully guarded by <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> and his daughter.
 For the defence of Italy, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated <GPE>Pannonia</GPE> and Noricum, which they left in a peaceful and flourishing condition: the sovereignty was claimed by the emperor of the Romans; the actual possession was abandoned to the boldness of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invader.
 On the opposite banks of the Danube, the plains of Upper Hungary and the Transylvanian hills were possessed, since the death of Attila, The <NORP>Gepidae</NORP> by the tribes of the Gepidae, who respected the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, and despised, not indeed the gold of the Romans, but the secret motive of their <DATE>annual</DATE> subsidies.
 The vacant fortifications of the river were instantly occupied by these Barbarians; their standards were planted on the walls of <GPE>Sirmium</GPE> and Belgrade; and the ironical tone of their apology aggravated this insult on the majesty of the empire.
Their presumption was excused by the mode of revenge which <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> embraced.
 Instead of asserting the rights of a sovereign for the protection of his subjects, the emperor invited a strange people to invade and possess the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces between the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and the ambition of the <NORP>Gepidae</NORP> was checked by the rising power and fame of The Lombards.
 the LOMBARDS.
 (7) This corrupt appellation has been diffused in the thirteenth century by the merchants and bankers, the <NORP>Italian</NORP> posterity of these savage warriors: but the original name of <PERSON>Langobards</PERSON> is expressive only of the peculiar length and fashion of their beards.
 I am not disposed either to question or to justify their <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> origin; (8) nor to pursue the migrations of the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> through unknown regions and marvellous adventures.
 About the time of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan, a ray of historic light breaks on the darkness of their antiquities, and they are discovered, for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time, between the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and the Oder.
 Fierce, beyond the example of the Germans, they delighted to propagate the tremendous belief, that their heads were formed like the heads of dogs, and that they drank the blood of their enemies, whom they vanquished in battle.
 The smallness of their numbers was recruited by the adoption of their bravest slaves; and alone, amidst their powerful neighbours, they defended by arms their high-spirited independence.
 In the tempests of the north, which overwhelmed so many names and nations, this little bark of the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> still floated on the surface: they gradually descended towards the south and the Danube, and, at the end of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred years, they again appear with their ancient valour and renown.
 Their manners were not less ferocious.
 The assassination of a royal guest was executed in the presence, and by the command, of the king's daughter, who had been provoked by some words of insult, and disappointed by his diminutive stature; and a tribute, the price of blood, was imposed on the Lombards, by his brother the king of the Heruli.
 Adversity revived a sense of moderation and justice, and the insolence of conquest was chastised by the signal defeat and irreparable dispersion of the Heruli, who were seated in the southern provinces of Poland.
 (9) The victories of the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> recommended them to the friendship of the emperors; and at the solicitations of Justinian, they passed the Danube, to reduce, according to their treaty, the cities of <GPE>Noricum</GPE> and the fortresses of Pannonia.
 But the spirit of rapine soon tempted them beyond these ample limits; they wandered along the coast of the <LOC>Hadriatic</LOC> as far as Dyrrachium, and presumed, with familiar rudeness to enter the towns and houses of their <NORP>Roman</NORP> allies, and to seize the captives who had escaped from their audacious hands.
 These acts of hostility, the sallies, as it might be pretended, of some loose adventurers, were disowned by the nation, and excused by the emperor; but the arms of the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> were more seriously engaged by a contest of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, which was terminated only by the extirpation of the Gepidae.
 The hostile nations often pleaded their cause before the throne of Constantinople; and the crafty Justinian, to whom the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were almost equally odious, pronounced a partial and ambiguous sentence, and dexterously protracted the war by slow and ineffectual succours.
 Their strength was formidable, since the Lombards, who sent into the field several myriads of soldiers, still claimed, as the weaker side, the protection of the Romans.
 Their spirit was intrepid; yet such is the uncertainty of courage, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies were suddenly struck with a panic; they fled from each other, and the rival kings remained with their guards in the midst of an empty plain.
 A short truce was obtained; but their mutual resentment again kindled; and the remembrance of their shame rendered the next encounter more desperate and bloody.
 Forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> perished in the decisive battle, which broke the power of the Gepidae, transferred the fears and wishes of Justinian, and <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> displayed the character of Alboin, the youthful prince of the Lombards, and the future conqueror of Italy.
 (10) The Sclavonians.
 The wild people who dwelt or wandered in the plains of Russia, Lithuania, and Poland, might be reduced, in the age of Justinian, under the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great families of the <ORG>BULGARIANS</ORG> (11) and the SCLAVONIANS.
 According to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> writers, the former, who touched the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> and the Lake Maeotis, derived from the <NORP>Huns</NORP> their name or descent; and it is needless to renew the simple and well-known picture of <NORP>Tartar</NORP> manners.
 They were bold and dexterous archers, who drank the milk, and feasted on the flesh, of their fleet and indefatigable horses; whose flocks and herds followed, or rather guided, the motions of their roving camps; to whose inroads no country was remote or impervious, and who were practised in flight, though incapable of fear.
 The nation was divided into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> powerful and hostile tribes, who pursued each other with fraternal hatred.
 They eagerly disputed the friendship, or rather the gifts, of the emperor; and the distinctions which nature had fixed between the faithful dog and the rapacious wolf was applied by an ambassador who received only verbal instructions from the mouth of his illiterate prince.
 (12) The Bulgarians, of whatsoever species, were equally attracted by <NORP>Roman</NORP> wealth: they assumed a vague dominion over the <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> name, and their rapid marches could only be stopped by the Baltic Sea, or the extreme cold and poverty of the north.
 But the same race of <NORP>Sclavonians</NORP> appears to have maintained, in every age, the possession of the same countries.
 Their numerous tribes, however distant or adverse, used <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> common language, (it was harsh and irregular,) and where known by the resemblance of their form, which deviated from the swarthy Tartar, and approached without attaining the lofty stature and fair complexion of the German.
 Four <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred villages (13) were scattered over the provinces of <GPE>Russia</GPE> and Poland, and their huts were hastily built of rough timber, in a country deficient both in stone and iron.
 Erected, or rather concealed, in the depth of forests, on the banks of rivers, or the edges of morasses, we may not perhaps, without flattery, compare them to the architecture of the beaver; which they resembled in a double issue, to the land and water, for the escape of the savage inhabitant, an animal less cleanly, less diligent, and less social, than that marvellous quadruped.
 The fertility of the soil, rather than the labor of the natives, supplied the rustic plenty of the Sclavonians.
 Their sheep and horned cattle were large and numerous, and the fields which they sowed with millet or panic (14) afforded, in place of bread, a coarse and less nutritive food.
 The incessant rapine of their neighbours compelled them to bury this treasure in the earth; but on the appearance of a stranger, it was freely imparted by a people, whose unfavourable character is qualified by the epithets of chaste, patient, and hospitable.
 As their supreme god, they adored an invisible master of the thunder.
 The rivers and the nymphs obtained their subordinate honours, and the popular worship was expressed in vows and sacrifice.
 The <NORP>Sclavonians</NORP> disdained to obey a despot, a prince, or even a magistrate; but their experience was too narrow, their passions too headstrong, to compose a system of equal law or general defence.
 Some voluntary respect was yielded to age and valour; but each tribe or village existed as a separate republic, and all must be persuaded where none could be compelled.
 They fought on foot, almost naked, and except an unwieldy shield, without any defensive armour; their weapons of offence were a bow, a quiver of small poisoned arrows, and a long rope, which they dexterously threw from a distance, and entangled their enemy in a running noose.
 In the field, the <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> infantry was dangerous by their speed, agility, and hardiness: they swam, they dived, they remained under water, drawing their breath through a hollow cane; and a river or lake was often the scene of their unsuspected ambuscade.
 But these were the achievements of spies or stragglers; the military art was unknown to the Sclavonians; their name was obscure, and their conquests were inglorious.
 (15) Their inroads.
 I have marked the faint and general outline of the <NORP>Sclavonians</NORP> and Bulgarians, without attempting to define their intermediate boundaries, which were not accurately known or respected by the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> themselves.
 Their importance was measured by their vicinity to the empire; and the level country of <GPE>Moldavia</GPE> and <GPE>Wallachia</GPE> was occupied by the Antes, (16) a <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> tribe, which swelled the titles of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> with an epithet of conquest.
 (17) Against the <PERSON>Antes</PERSON> he erected the fortifications of the Lower Danube; and labored to secure the alliance of a people seated in the direct channel of northern inundation, an interval of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred miles between the mountains of <GPE>Transylvania</GPE> and the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> Sea.
 But the <PERSON>Antes</PERSON> wanted power and inclination to stem the fury of the torrent; and the light-armed Sclavonians, from a hundred tribes, pursued with almost equal speed the footsteps of the <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> horse.
 The payment of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> piece of gold for each soldier procured a safe and easy retreat through the country of the Gepidae, who commanded the passage of the Upper Danube.
 (18) The hopes or fears of the Barbarians; their intense union or discord; the accident of a frozen or shallow stream; the prospect of harvest or vintage; the prosperity or distress of the Romans; were the causes which produced the uniform repetition of <DATE>annual</DATE> visits, (19) tedious in the narrative, and destructive in the event.
 The same year, and possibly the same month, in which <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> surrendered, was marked by an invasion of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> or Bulgarians, so dreadful, that it almost effaced the memory of their past inroads.
 They spread from the suburbs of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to the Ionian Gulf, destroyed <CARDINAL>thirty-two</CARDINAL> cities or castles, erased Potidaea, which <GPE>Athens</GPE> had built, and <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> had besieged, and repassed the Danube, dragging at their horses' heels <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and twenty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the subjects of Justinian.
 In a subsequent inroad they pierced the wall of the Thracian Chersonesus, extirpated the habitations and the inhabitants, boldly traversed the Hellespont, and returned to their companions, laden with the spoils of Asia.
 Another party, which seemed a multitude in the eyes of the Romans, penetrated, without opposition, from the Straits of <LOC>Thermopylae</LOC> to the <LOC>Isthmus</LOC> of Corinth; and the last ruin of <GPE>Greece</GPE> has appeared an object too minute for the attention of history.
 The works which the emperor raised for the protection, but at the expense of his subjects, served only to disclose the weakness of some neglected part; and the walls, which by flattery had been deemed impregnable, were either deserted by the garrison, or scaled by the Barbarians.
 Three <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Sclavonians, who insolently divided themselves into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bands, discovered the weakness and misery of a triumphant reign.
 They passed the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the Hebrus, vanquished the <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals who dared to oppose their progress, and plundered, with impunity, the cities of <GPE>Illyricum</GPE> and Thrace, each of which had arms and numbers to overwhelm their contemptible assailants.
 Whatever praise the boldness of the <NORP>Sclavonians</NORP> may deserve, it is sullied by the wanton and deliberate cruelty which they are accused of exercising on their prisoners.
 Without distinction of rank, or age, or sex, the captives were impaled or flayed alive, or suspended between <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> posts, and beaten with clubs till they expired, or enclosed in some spacious building, and left to perish in the flames with the spoil and cattle which might impede the march of these savage victors.
 (20) Perhaps a more impartial narrative would reduce the number, and qualify the nature, of these horrid acts; and they might sometimes be excused by the cruel laws of retaliation.
 In the siege of Topirus, (21) whose obstinate defence had enraged the Sclavonians, they massacred fifteen <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> males; but they spared the women and children; the most valuable captives were always reserved for labor or ransom; the servitude was not rigorous, and the terms of their deliverance were speedy and moderate.
 But the subject, or the historian of Justinian, exhaled his just indignation in the language of complaint and reproach; and <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> has confidently affirmed, that in a reign of <CARDINAL>thirty-two</CARDINAL> years, each <DATE>annual</DATE> inroad of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> consumed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The entire population of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> Europe, which nearly corresponds with the provinces of Justinian, would perhaps be incapable of supplying <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of persons, the result of this incredible estimate.
 (22) Origin and monarchy of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in Asia, A.
D.
 545 etc.
 In the midst of these obscure calamities, <LOC>Europe</LOC> felt the shock of revolution, which <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> revealed to the world the name and nation of the TURKS.
 Like Romulus, the founder of that martial people was suckled by a she-wolf, who afterwards made him the father of a numerous progeny; and the representation of that animal in the banners of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> preserved the memory, or rather suggested the idea, of a fable, which was invented, without any mutual intercourse, by the shepherds of <NORP>Latium</NORP> and those of Scythia.
 At the equal distance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> miles from the Caspian, the Icy, the Chinese, and the Bengal Seas, a ridge of mountains is conspicuous, the centre, and perhaps the summit, of Asia; which, in the language of different nations, has been styled Imaus, and Caf, (23) and Altai, and the Golden Mountains, ! and the Girdle of the Earth.
 The sides of the hills were productive of minerals; and the iron forges, (24) for the purpose of war, were exercised by the Turks, the most despised portion of the slaves of the great khan of the Geougen.
 But their servitude could only last till a leader, bold and eloquent, should arise to persuade his countrymen that the same arms which they forged for their masters, might become, in their own hands, the instruments of freedom and victory.
 They sallied from the mountains; (25) a sceptre was the reward of his advice; and the <DATE>annual</DATE> ceremony, in which a piece of iron was heated in the fire, and a smith's hammer was successively handled by the prince and his nobles, recorded for ages the humble profession and rational pride of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> nation.
 Bertezena, !! their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> leader, signalized their valour and his own in successful combats against the neighbouring tribes; but when he presumed to ask in marriage the daughter of the great khan, the insolent demand of a slave and a mechanic was contemptuously rejected.
 The disgrace was expiated by a more noble alliance with a princess of China; and the decisive battle which almost extirpated the nation of the Geougen, established in <GPE>Tartary</GPE> the new and more powerful empire of the Turks.
 They reigned over the north; but they confessed the vanity of conquest, by their faithful attachment to the mountain of their fathers.
 The royal encampment seldom lost sight of Mount Altai, from whence the River Irtish descends to water the rich pastures of the Calmucks, (26) which nourish the largest sheep and oxen in the world.
 The soil is fruitful, and the climate mild and temperate: the happy region was ignorant of earthquake and pestilence; the emperor's throne was turned towards the East, and a golden wolf on the top of a spear seemed to guard the entrance of his tent.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <PERSON>Bertezena</PERSON> was tempted by the luxury and superstition of China; but his design of building cities and temples was defeated by the simple wisdom of a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> counsellor.
They entertained, with less reluctance, the doctrines of Zoroaster; but the greatest part of the nation acquiesced, without inquiry, in the opinions, or rather in the practice, of their ancestors.
 The honours of sacrifice were reserved for the supreme deity; they acknowledged, in rude hymns, their obligations to the air, the fire, the water, and the earth; and their priests derived some profit from the art of divination.
 Their unwritten laws were rigorous and impartial: theft was punished with a tenfold restitution; adultery, treason, and murder, with death; and no chastisement could be inflicted too severe for the rare and inexpiable guilt of cowardice.
 As the subject nations marched under the standard of the Turks, their cavalry, both men and horses, were proudly computed by millions; <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their effective armies consisted of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers, and in less than fifty years they were connected in peace and war with the Romans, the Persians, and the Chinese.
 In their northern limits, some vestige may be discovered of the form and situation of Kamptchatka, of a people of hunters and fishermen, whose sledges were drawn by dogs, and whose habitations were buried in the earth.
 The <NORP>Turks</NORP> were ignorant of astronomy; but the observation taken by some learned Chinese, with a gnomon of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> feet, fixes the royal camp in the latitude of forty-nine degrees, and marks their extreme progress within three, or at least <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> degrees, of the polar circle.
 (27) Among their southern conquests the most splendid was that of the Nephthalites, or white Huns, a polite and warlike people, who possessed the commercial cities of <NORP>Bochara</NORP> and Samarcand, who had vanquished the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch, and carried their victorious arms along the banks, and perhaps to the mouth, of the Indus.
 On the side of the West, the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> cavalry advanced to the Lake Maeotis.
 They passed that lake on the ice.
 The khan who dwelt at the foot of Mount <LOC>Altai</LOC> issued his commands for the siege of Bosphorus, (28) a city the voluntary subject of Rome, and whose princes had formerly been the friends of Athens.
 (29) To the east, the <NORP>Turks</NORP> invaded China, as often as the vigour of the government was relaxed: and I am taught to read in the history of the times, that they mowed down their patient enemies like hemp or grass; and that the mandarins applauded the wisdom of an emperor who repulsed these <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with golden lances.
 This extent of savage empire compelled the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> monarch to establish <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> subordinate princes of his own blood, who soon forgot their gratitude and allegiance.
 The conquerors were enervated by luxury, which is always fatal except to an industrious people; the policy of <GPE>China</GPE> solicited the vanquished nations to resume their independence and the power of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> was limited to a period of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred years.
 The revival of their name and dominion in the southern countries of <LOC>Asia</LOC> are the events of a later age; and the dynasties, which succeeded to their native realms, may sleep in oblivion; since their history bears no relation to the decline and fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (30) The <PERSON>Avars</PERSON> fly before the Turks, and approach the empire.
 In the rapid career of conquest, the <NORP>Turks</NORP> attacked and subdued the nation of the <NORP>Ogors</NORP> or <NORP>Varchonites</NORP> on the banks of the River Til, which derived the epithet of Black from its dark water or gloomy forests.
 (31) The khan of the <NORP>Ogors</NORP> was slain with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of his subjects, and their bodies were scattered over the space of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> days' journey: their surviving countrymen acknowledged the strength and mercy of the Turks; and a small portion, about twenty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, preferred exile to servitude.
 They followed the well-known road of the Volga, cherished the error of the nations who confounded them with the AVARS, and spread the terror of that false though famous appellation, which had not, however, saved its lawful proprietors from the yoke of the Turks.
 (32) After a long and victorious march, the new <PERSON>Avars</PERSON> arrived at the foot of Mount Caucasus, in the country of the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> (33) and Circassians, where they <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> heard of the splendour and weakness of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 They humbly requested their confederate, the prince of the Alani, to lead them to this source of riches; and their ambassador, with the permission of the governor of Lazica, was transported by the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> Sea to Constantinople.
 The whole city was poured forth to behold with curiosity and terror the aspect of a strange people: their long hair, which hung in tresses down their backs, was gracefully bound with ribbons, but the rest of their habit appeared to imitate the fashion of the Huns.
 Their embassy to Constantinople, A.
D.
 558.
 When they were admitted to the audience of Justinian, Candish, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the ambassadors, addressed the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor in these terms:At the time of this embassy, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> had reigned above thirty, he had lived above seventy-five years: his mind, as well as his body, was feeble and languid; and the conqueror of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Italy, careless of the permanent interest of his people, aspired only to end his days in the bosom even of inglorious peace.
 In a studied oration, he imparted to the senate his resolution to dissemble the insult, and to purchase the friendship of the Avars; and the whole senate, like the mandarins of China, applauded the incomparable wisdom and foresight of their sovereign.
 The instruments of luxury were immediately prepared to captivate the Barbarians; silken garments, soft and splendid beds, and chains and collars encrusted with gold.
 The ambassadors, content with such liberal reception, departed from Constantinople, and Valentin, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the emperor's guards, was sent with a similar character to their camp at the foot of Mount Caucasus.
 As their destruction or their success must be alike advantageous to the empire, he persuaded them to invade the enemies of Rome; and they were easily tempted, by gifts and promises, to gratify their ruling inclinations.
 These fugitives, who fled before the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> arms, passed the <NORP>Tanais</NORP> and Borysthenes, and boldly advanced into the heart of <GPE>Poland</GPE> and Germany, violating the law of nations, and abusing the rights of victory.
 Before <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years had elapsed, their camps were seated on the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the Elbe, many <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> and <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> names were obliterated from the earth, and the remainder of their tribes are found, as tributaries and vassals, under the standard of the Avars.
 The chagan, the peculiar title of their king, still affected to cultivate the friendship of the emperor; and <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> entertained some thoughts of fixing them in Pannonia, to balance the prevailing power of the Lombards.
 But the virtue or treachery of an <NORP>Avar</NORP> betrayed the secret enmity and ambitious designs of their countrymen; and they loudly complained of the timid, though jealous policy, of detaining their ambassadors, and denying the arms which they had been allowed to purchase in the capital of the empire.
 (34) Embassies of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and the Romans, A.
D.
 569-582.
 Perhaps the apparent change in the dispositions of the emperors may be ascribed to the embassy which was received from the conquerors of the Avars.
 (35) The immense distance which eluded their arms could not extinguish their resentment: the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> ambassadors pursued the footsteps of the vanquished to the Jaik, the Volga, Mount Caucasus, the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> and Constantinople, and at length appeared before the successor of Constantine, to request that he would not espouse the cause of rebels and fugitives.
 Even commerce had some share in this remarkable negotiation: and the Sogdoites, who were now the tributaries of the Turks, embraced the fair occasion of opening, by the north of the Caspian, a new road for the importation of <NORP>Chinese</NORP> silk into the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The Persian, who preferred the navigation of Ceylon, had stopped the caravans of <NORP>Bochara</NORP> and Samarcand: their silk was contemptuously burnt: some <NORP>Turkish</NORP> ambassadors died in Persia, with a suspicion of poison; and the great khan permitted his faithful vassal Maniach, the prince of the Sogdoites, to propose, at the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court, a treaty of alliance against their common enemies.
 Their splendid apparel and rich presents, the fruit of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> luxury, distinguished <PERSON>Maniach</PERSON> and his colleagues from the rude savages of the North: their letters, in the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> character and language, announced a people who had attained the rudiments of science: (36) they enumerated the conquests, they offered the friendship and military aid of the Turks; and their sincerity was attested by direful imprecations (if they were guilty of falsehood) against their own head, and the head of <PERSON>Disabul</PERSON> their master.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> prince entertained with hospitable regard the ambassadors of a remote and powerful monarch: the sight of silk-worms and looms disappointed the hopes of the Sogdoites; the emperor renounced, or seemed to renounce, the fugitive Avars, but he accepted the alliance of the Turks; and the ratification of the treaty was carried by a <NORP>Roman</NORP> minister to the foot of Mount Altai.
 Under the successors of Justinian, the friendship of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations was cultivated by frequent and cordial intercourse; the most favoured vassals were permitted to imitate the example of the great khan, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> Turks, who, on various occasions, had visited Constantinople, departed at the same time for their native country.
 The duration and length of the journey from the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court to Mount <LOC>Altai</LOC> are not specified: it might have been difficult to mark a road through the nameless deserts, the mountains, rivers, and morasses of Tartary; but a curious account has been preserved of the reception of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassadors at the royal camp.
 After they had been purified with fire and incense, according to a rite still practised under the sons of Zingis, they were introduced to the presence of Disabul.
 In a valley of the Golden Mountain, they found the great khan in his tent, seated in a chair with wheels, to which a horse might be occasionally harnessed.
 As soon as they had delivered their presents, which were received by the proper officers, they exposed, in a florid oration, the wishes of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor, that victory might attend the arms of the Turks, that their reign might be long and prosperous, and that a strict alliance, without envy or deceit, might forever be maintained between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful nations of the earth.
 The answer of <PERSON>Disabul</PERSON> corresponded with these friendly professions, and the ambassadors were seated by his side, at a banquet which lasted the greatest part of the day: the tent was surrounded with silk hangings, and a <NORP>Tartar</NORP> liquor was served on the table, which possessed at least the intoxicating qualities of wine.
 The entertainment of the succeeding <DATE>day</DATE> was more sumptuous; the silk hangings of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> tent were embroidered in various figures; and the royal seat, the cups, and the vases, were of gold.
 A <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> pavilion was supported by columns of gilt wood; a bed of pure and massy gold was raised on <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> peacocks of the same metal: and before the entrance of the tent, dishes, basins, and statues of solid silver, and admirable art, were ostentatiously piled in wagons, the monuments of valour rather than of industry.
 When <PERSON>Disabul</PERSON> led his armies against the frontiers of Persia, his <NORP>Roman</NORP> allies followed many days the march of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> camp, nor were they dismissed till they had enjoyed their precedency over the envoy of the great king, whose loud and intemperate clamours interrupted the silence of the royal banquet.
 The power and ambition of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> cemented the union of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Romans, who touched his dominions on either side: but those distant nations, regardless of each other, consulted the dictates of interest, without recollecting the obligations of oaths and treaties.
 While the successor of <PERSON>Disabul</PERSON> celebrated his father's obsequies, he was saluted by the ambassadors of the emperor Tiberius, who proposed an invasion of Persia, and sustained, with firmness, the angry and perhaps the just reproaches of that haughty Barbarian.
 Notwithstanding this menace, a sense of mutual advantage soon renewed the alliance of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Romans: but the pride of the great khan survived his resentment; and when he announced an important conquest to his friend the emperor Maurice, he styled himself the master of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> races, and the lord of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> climates of the world.
 (37) State of Persia, A.
D.
 500-530.
 Disputes have often arisen between the sovereigns of <LOC>Asia</LOC> for the title of king of the world; while the contest has proved that it could not belong to either of the competitors.
 The kingdom of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> was bounded by the <NORP>Oxus</NORP> or Gihon; and <PERSON>Touran</PERSON> was separated by that great river from the rival monarchy of Iran, or Persia, which in a smaller compass contained perhaps a larger measure of power and population.
 The Persians, who alternately invaded and repulsed the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and the Romans, were still ruled by the house of Sassan, which ascended the throne <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred years before the accession of Justinian.
 His contemporary, Cabades, or Kobad, had been successful in war against the emperor Anastasius; but the reign of that prince was distracted by civil and religious troubles.
 A prisoner in the hands of his subjects, an exile among the enemies of Persia, he recovered his liberty by prostituting the honour of his wife, and regained his kingdom with the dangerous and mercenary aid of the Barbarians, who had slain his father.
 His nobles were suspicious that <PERSON>Kobad</PERSON> never forgave the authors of his expulsion, or even those of his restoration.
 The people was deluded and inflamed by the fanaticism of Mazdak, (38) who asserted the community of women, (39) and the equality of mankind, whilst he appropriated the richest lands and most beautiful females to the use of his sectaries.
 The view of these disorders, which had been fomented by his laws and example, (40) embittered the declining age of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch; and his fears were increased by the consciousness of his design to reverse the natural and customary order of succession, in favour of his <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> and most favoured son, so famous under the names of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> and Nushirvan.
 To render the youth more illustrious in the eyes of the nations, <PERSON>Kobad</PERSON> was desirous that he should be adopted by the emperor Justin: the hope of peace inclined the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court to accept this singular proposal; and <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> might have acquired a specious claim to the inheritance of his <NORP>Roman</NORP> parent.
 But the future mischief was diverted by the advice of the quaestor Proclus: a difficulty was started, whether the adoption should be performed as a civil or military rite; (41) the treaty was abruptly dissolved; and the sense of this indignity sunk deep into the mind of Chosroes, who had already advanced to the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> on his road to Constantinople.
 His father did not long survive the disappointment of his wishes: the testament of their deceased sovereign was read in the assembly of the nobles; and a powerful faction, prepared for the event, and regardless of the priority of age, exalted <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> to the throne of Persia.
 He filled that throne during a prosperous period of forty-eight years; (42) and the JUSTICE of <GPE>Nushirvan</GPE> is celebrated as the theme of immortal praise by the nations of the East.
 Reign of Nushirvan, or Chosroes, A.
D.
 531-579.
 But the justice of kings is understood by themselves, and even by their subjects, with an ample indulgence for the gratification of passion and interest.
 The virtue of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was that of a conqueror, who, in the measures of peace and war, is excited by ambition, and restrained by prudence; who confounds the greatness with the happiness of a nation, and calmly devotes the lives of <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> to the fame, or even the amusement, of a single man.
 In his domestic administration, the just <GPE>Nushirvan</GPE> would merit in our feelings the appellation of a tyrant.
 His <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> elder brothers had been deprived of their fair expectations of the diadem: their future life, between the supreme rank and the condition of subjects, was anxious to themselves and formidable to their master: fear as well as revenge might tempt them to rebel: the slightest evidence of a conspiracy satisfied the author of their wrongs; and the repose of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was secured by the death of these unhappy princes, with their families and adherents.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> guiltless youth was saved and dismissed by the compassion of a veteran general; and this act of humanity, which was revealed by his son, overbalanced the merit of reducing <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> nations to the obedience of Persia.
 The zeal and prudence of <PERSON>Mebodes</PERSON> had fixed the diadem on the head of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> himself; but he delayed to attend the royal summons, till he had performed the duties of a military review: he was instantly commanded to repair to the iron tripod, which stood before the gate of the palace, (43) where it was death to relieve or approach the victim; and <PERSON>Mebodes</PERSON> languished several days before his sentence was pronounced, by the inflexible pride and calm ingratitude of the son of Kobad.
 But the people, more especially in the East, is disposed to forgive, and even to applaud, the cruelty which strikes at the loftiest heads; at the slaves of ambition, whose voluntary choice has exposed them to live in the smiles, and to perish by the frown, of a capricious monarch.
 In the execution of the laws which he had no temptation to violate; in the punishment of crimes which attacked his own dignity, as well as the happiness of individuals; Nushirvan, or Chosroes, deserved the appellation of just.
 His government was firm, rigorous, and impartial.
 It was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> labor of his reign to abolish the dangerous theory of common or equal possessions: the lands and women which the sectaries of <GPE>Mazdak</GPE> has usurped were restored to their lawful owners; and the temperate chastisement of the fanatics or impostors confirmed the domestic rights of society.
 Instead of listening with blind confidence to a favourite minister, he established <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> viziers over the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> great provinces of his empire, Assyria, Media, Persia, and Bactriana.
 In the choice of judges, praefects, and counsellors, he strove to remove the mask which is always worn in the presence of kings: he wished to substitute the natural order of talents for the accidental distinctions of birth and fortune; he professed, in specious language, his intention to prefer those men who carried the poor in their bosoms, and to banish corruption from the seat of justice, as dogs were excluded from the temples of the Magi.
 The code of laws of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PRODUCT>Artaxerxes</PRODUCT> was revived and published as the rule of the magistrates; but the assurance of speedy punishment was the best security of their virtue.
 Their behaviour was inspected by a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> eyes, their words were overheard by a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> ears, the secret or public agents of the throne; and the provinces, from the <NORP>Indian</NORP> to the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> confines, were enlightened by the frequent visits of a sovereign, who affected to emulate his celestial brother in his rapid and salutary career.
 Education and agriculture he viewed as the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> objects most deserving of his care.
 In every city of <GPE>Persia</GPE> orphans, and the children of the poor, were maintained and instructed at the public expense; the daughters were given in marriage to the richest citizens of their own rank, and the sons, according to their different talents, were employed in mechanic trades, or promoted to more honourable service.
 The deserted villages were relieved by his bounty; to the peasants and farmers who were found incapable of cultivating their lands, he distributed cattle, seed, and the instruments of husbandry; and the rare and inestimable treasure of fresh water was parsimoniously managed, and skilfully dispersed over the arid territory of Persia.
 (44) The prosperity of that kingdom was the effect and evidence of his virtues; his vices are those of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> despotism; but in the long competition between <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> and Justinian, the advantage both of merit and fortune is almost always on the side of the Barbarian.
 (45) His love of learning.
 To the praise of justice <GPE>Nushirvan</GPE> united the reputation of knowledge; and the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <NORP>Greek</NORP> philosophers, who visited his court, were invited and deceived by the strange assurance, that a disciple of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> was seated on the <NORP>Persian</NORP> throne.
 Did they expect, that a prince, strenuously exercised in the toils of war and government, should agitate, with dexterity like their own, the abstruse and profound questions which amused the leisure of the schools of Athens? Could they hope that the precepts of philosophy should direct the life, and control the passions, of a despot, whose infancy had been taught to consider his absolute and fluctuating will as the only rule of moral obligation? (46) The studies of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> were ostentatious and superficial: but his example awakened the curiosity of an ingenious people, and the light of science was diffused over the dominions of Persia.
 (47) At Gondi Sapor, in the neighbourhood of the royal city of Susa, an academy of physic was founded, which insensibly became a liberal school of poetry, philosophy, and rhetoric.
 (48) The annals of the monarchy (49) were composed; and while recent and authentic history might afford some useful lessons both to the prince and people, the darkness of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ages was embellished by the giants, the dragons, and the fabulous heroes of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> romance.
 (50) Every learned or confident stranger was enriched by the bounty, and flattered by the conversation, of the monarch: he nobly rewarded a <NORP>Greek</NORP> physician, (51) by the deliverance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand, captives; and the sophists, who contended for his favour, were exasperated by the wealth and insolence of Uranius, their more successful rival.
 <GPE>Nushirvan</GPE> believed, or at least respected, the religion of the Magi; and some traces of persecution may be discovered in his reign.
 (52) Yet he allowed himself freely to compare the tenets of the various sects; and the theological disputes, in which he frequently presided, diminished the authority of the priest, and enlightened the minds of the people.
 At his command, the most celebrated writers of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and <GPE>India</GPE> were translated into the <NORP>Persian</NORP> language; a smooth and elegant idiom, recommended by <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> to the use of paradise; though it is branded with the epithets of savage and unmusical, by the ignorance and presumption of Agathias.
 (53) Yet the <NORP>Greek</NORP> historian might reasonably wonder that it should be found possible to execute an entire version of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> and <PERSON>Aristotle</PERSON> in a foreign dialect, which had not been framed to express the spirit of freedom and the subtilties of philosophic disquisition.
 And, if the reason of the Stagyrite might be equally dark, or equally intelligible in every tongue, the dramatic art and verbal argumentation of the disciple of Socrates, (54) appear to be indissolubly mingled with the grace and perfection of his Attic style.
 In the search of universal knowledge, <GPE>Nushirvan</GPE> was informed, that the moral and political fables of Pilpay, an ancient Brachman, were preserved with jealous reverence among the treasures of the kings of India.
 The physician <PERSON>Perozes</PERSON> was secretly despatched to the banks of the Ganges, with instructions to procure, at any price, the communication of this valuable work.
 His dexterity obtained a transcript, his learned diligence accomplished the translation; and the fables of <PERSON>Pilpay</PERSON> (55) were read and admired in the assembly of <GPE>Nushirvan</GPE> and his nobles.
 The <NORP>Indian</NORP> original, and the <NORP>Persian</NORP> copy, have long since disappeared; but this venerable monument has been saved by the curiosity of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> caliphs, revived in the modern Persic, the Turkish, the Syriac, the Hebrew, and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> idioms, and transfused through successive versions into the modern languages of Europe.
 In their present form, the peculiar character, the manners and religion of the Hindoos, are completely obliterated; and the intrinsic merit of the fables of <PERSON>Pilpay</PERSON> is far inferior to the concise elegance of Phaedrus, and the native graces of La Fontaine.
 <CARDINAL>Fifteen</CARDINAL> moral and political sentences are illustrated in a series of apologues: but the composition is intricate, the narrative prolix, and the precept obvious and barren.
 Yet the <PERSON>Brachman</PERSON> may assume the merit of inventing a pleasing fiction, which adorns the nakedness of truth, and alleviates, perhaps, to a royal ear, the harshness of instruction.
 With a similar design, to admonish kings that they are strong only in the strength of their subjects, the same <NORP>Indians</NORP> invented the game of chess, which was likewise introduced into <GPE>Persia</GPE> under the reign of Nushirvan.
 (56) Peace and war with the Romans, A.
D.
 533-539.
 The son of <PERSON>Kobad</PERSON> found his kingdom involved in a war with the successor of Constantine; and the anxiety of his domestic situation inclined him to grant the suspension of arms, which <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was impatient to purchase.
 <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> saw the <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassadors at his feet.
 He accepted eleven <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, as the price of an endless or indefinite peace: (57) some mutual exchanges were regulated; the <NORP>Persian</NORP> assumed the guard of the gates of Caucasus, and the demolition of <PERSON>Dara</PERSON> was suspended, on condition that it should never be made the residence of the general of the East.
 This interval of repose had been solicited, and was diligently improved, by the ambition of the emperor: his <NORP>African</NORP> conquests were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fruits of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> treaty; and the avarice of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was soothed by a large portion of the spoils of Carthage, which his ambassadors required in a tone of pleasantry and under the colour of friendship.
 (58) But the trophies of <GPE>Belisarius</GPE> disturbed the slumbers of the great king; and he heard with astonishment, envy, and fear, that Sicily, Italy, and <GPE>Rome</GPE> itself, had been reduced, in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rapid campaigns, to the obedience of Justinian.
 Unpractised in the art of violating treaties, he secretly excited his bold and subtle vassal Almondar.
 That prince of the Saracens, who resided at Hira, (59) had not been included in the general peace, and still waged an obscure war against his rival Arethas, the chief of the tribe of Gassan, and confederate of the empire.
 The subject of their dispute was an extensive sheep-walk in the desert to the south of Palmyra.
 An immemorial tribute for the license of pasture appeared to attest the rights of Almondar, while the <PERSON>Gassanite</PERSON> appealed to the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name of strata, a paved road, as an unquestionable evidence of the sovereignty and labours of the Romans.
 (60) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> monarchs supported the cause of their respective vassals; and the <NORP>Persian</NORP> Arab, without expecting the event of a slow and doubtful arbitration, enriched his flying camp with the spoil and captives of Syria.
 Instead of repelling the arms, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> attempted to seduce the fidelity of Almondar, while he called from the extremities of the earth the nations of <PERSON>Aethiopia</PERSON> and <GPE>Scythia</GPE> to invade the dominions of his rival.
 But the aid of such allies was distant and precarious, and the discovery of this hostile correspondence justified the complaints of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Armenians, who implored, almost at the same time, the protection of Chosroes.
 The descendants of Arsaces, who were still numerous in Armenia, had been provoked to assert the last relics of national freedom and hereditary rank; and the ambassadors of <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> had secretly traversed the empire to expose the instant, and almost inevitable, danger of the kingdom of Italy.
 Their representations were uniform, weighty, and effectual.
By such arguments, <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was easily persuaded to imitate the example which he condemned: but the Persian, ambitious of military fame, disdained the inactive warfare of a rival, who issued his sanguinary commands from the secure station of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace.
 He invades Syria, A.
D.
 540.
 Whatever might be the provocations of Chosroes, he abused the confidence of treaties; and the just reproaches of dissimulation and falsehood could only be concealed by the lustre of his victories.
 (62) The <NORP>Persian</NORP> army, which had been assembled in the plains of Babylon, prudently declined the strong cities of Mesopotamia, and followed the western bank of the Euphrates, till the small, though populous, town of <PERSON>Dura</PERSON> presumed to arrest the progress of the great king.
 The gates of Dura, by treachery and surprise, were burst open; and as soon as <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> had stained his cimeter with the blood of the inhabitants, he dismissed the ambassador of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> to inform his master in what place he had left the enemy of the Romans.
 The conqueror still affected the praise of humanity and justice; and as he beheld a noble matron with her infant rudely dragged along the ground, he sighed, he wept, and implored the divine justice to punish the author of these calamities.
 Yet the herd of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> captives was ransomed for <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred pounds of gold; the neighbouring bishop of <GPE>Sergiopolis</GPE> pledged his faith for the payment: and in the subsequent year the unfeeling avarice of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> exacted the penalty of an obligation which it was generous to contract and impossible to discharge.
 He advanced into the heart of Syria: but a feeble enemy, who vanished at his approach, disappointed him of the honour of victory; and as he could not hope to establish his dominion, the <NORP>Persian</NORP> king displayed in this inroad the mean and rapacious vices of a robber.
 Hierapolis, <GPE>Berrhaea</GPE> or Aleppo, <NORP>Apamea</NORP> and Chalcis, were successively besieged: they redeemed their safety by a ransom of gold or silver, proportioned to their respective strength and opulence; and their new master enforced, without observing, the terms of capitulation.
 Educated in the religion of the Magi, he exercised, without remorse, the lucrative trade of sacrilege; and, after stripping of its gold and gems a piece of the true cross, he generously restored the naked relic to the devotion of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of Apamea.
 and ruins Antioch.
 No more than fourteen years had elapsed since <GPE>Antioch</GPE> was ruined by an earthquake; but the queen of the East, the new Theopolis, had been raised from the ground by the liberality of Justinian; and the increasing greatness of the buildings and the people already erased the memory of this recent disaster.
 On <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> side, the city was defended by the mountain, on the other by the River Orontes; but the most accessible part was commanded by a superior eminence: the proper remedies were rejected, from the despicable fear of discovering its weakness to the enemy; and Germanus, the emperor's nephew, refused to trust his person and dignity within the walls of a besieged city.
 The people of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> had inherited the vain and satirical genius of their ancestors: they were elated by a sudden reinforcement of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers; they disdained the offers of an easy capitulation and their intemperate clamours insulted from the ramparts the majesty of the great king.
 Under his eye the <NORP>Persian</NORP> myriads mounted with scaling-ladders to the assault; the <NORP>Roman</NORP> mercenaries fled through the opposite gate of Daphne; and the generous assistance of the youth of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> served only to aggravate the miseries of their country.
 As Chosroes, attended by the ambassadors of Justinian, was descending from the mountain, he affected, in a plaintive voice, to deplore the obstinacy and ruin of that unhappy people; but the slaughter still raged with unrelenting fury; and the city, at the command of a Barbarian, was delivered to the flames.
 The cathedral of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> was indeed preserved by the avarice, not the piety, of the conqueror: a more honourable exemption was granted to the church of St.
 Julian, and the <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the town where the ambassadors resided; some distant streets were saved by the shifting of the wind, and the walls still subsisted to protect, and soon to betray, their new inhabitants.
 Fanaticism had defaced the ornaments of Daphne, but <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> breathed a purer air amidst her groves and fountains; and some idolaters in his train might sacrifice with impunity to the nymphs of that elegant retreat.
 Eighteen miles below Antioch, the River Orontes falls into the Mediterranean.
 The haughty <NORP>Persian</NORP> visited the term of his conquests; and, after bathing alone in the sea, he offered a solemn sacrifice of thanksgiving to the sun, or rather to the Creator of the sun, whom the <PERSON>Magi</PERSON> adored.
 If this act of superstition offended the prejudices of the Syrians, they were pleased by the courteous and even eager attention with which he assisted at the games of the circus; and as <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> had heard that the blue faction was espoused by the emperor, his peremptory command secured the victory of the green charioteer.
 From the discipline of his camp the people derived more solid consolation; and they interceded in vain for the life of a soldier who had too faithfully copied the rapine of the just Nushirvan.
 At length, fatigued, though unsatiated, with the spoil of Syria, he slowly moved to the Euphrates, formed a temporary bridge in the neighbourhood of Barbalissus, and defined the space of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days for the entire passage of his numerous host.
 After his return, he founded, at the distance of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day's journey from the palace of Ctesiphon, a new city, which perpetuated the joint names of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> and of Antioch.
 The <NORP>Syrian</NORP> captives recognized the form and situation of their native abodes: baths and a stately circus were constructed for their use; and a colony of musicians and charioteers revived in <GPE>Assyria</GPE> the pleasures of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> capital.
 By the munificence of the royal founder, a liberal allowance was assigned to these fortunate exiles; and they enjoyed the singular privilege of bestowing freedom on the slaves whom they acknowledged as their kinsmen.
 Palestine, and the holy wealth of Jerusalem, were the next objects that attracted the ambition, or rather the avarice, of Chosroes.
 Constantinople, and the palace of the Caesars, no longer appeared impregnable or remote; and his aspiring fancy already covered <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor with the troops, and the Black Sea with the navies, of Persia.
 Defence of the <LOC>East</LOC> by Belisarius, A.
D.
 541.
 These hopes might have been realized, if the conqueror of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had not been seasonably recalled to the defence of the East.
 (63) While <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> pursued his ambitious designs on the coast of the Euxine, Belisarius, at the head of an army without pay or discipline, encamped beyond the Euphrates, within <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> miles of Nisibis.
 He meditated, by a skilful operation, to draw the <NORP>Persians</NORP> from their impregnable citadel, and improving his advantage in the field, either to intercept their retreat, or perhaps to enter the gates with the flying Barbarians.
 He advanced <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day's journey on the territories of Persia, reduced the fortress of Sisaurane, and sent the governor, with <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> hundred chosen horsemen, to serve the emperor in his <NORP>Italian</NORP> wars.
 He detached <PERSON>Arethas</PERSON> and his Arabs, supported by <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> hundred Romans, to pass the Tigris, and to ravage the harvests of Assyria, a fruitful province, long exempt from the calamities of war.
 But the plans of <GPE>Belisarius</GPE> were disconcerted by the untractable spirit of Arethas, who neither returned to the camp, nor sent any intelligence of his motions.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general was fixed in anxious expectation to the same spot; the time of action elapsed, the ardent sun of <LOC>Mesopotamia</LOC> inflamed with fevers the blood of his <NORP>European</NORP> soldiers; and the stationary troops and officers of <GPE>Syria</GPE> affected to tremble for the safety of their defenceless cities.
 Yet this diversion had already succeeded in forcing <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> to return with loss and precipitation; and if the skill of <GPE>Belisarius</GPE> had been seconded by discipline and valour, his success might have satisfied the sanguine wishes of the public, who required at his hands the conquest of Ctesiphon, and the deliverance of the captives of Antioch.
 At the end of the campaign, he was recalled to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by an ungrateful court, A.
D.
 542but the dangers of the ensuing <DATE>spring</DATE> restored his confidence and command; and the hero, almost alone, was despatched, with the speed of post-horses, to repel, by his name and presence, the invasion of Syria.
 He found the <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals, among whom was a nephew of Justinian, imprisoned by their fears in the fortifications of Hierapolis.
 But instead of listening to their timid counsels, <GPE>Belisarius</GPE> commanded them to follow him to Europus, where he had resolved to collect his forces, and to execute whatever God should inspire him to achieve against the enemy.
 His firm attitude on the banks of the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> restrained <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> from advancing towards Palestine; and he received with art and dignity the ambassadors, or rather spies, of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch.
 The plain between <GPE>Hierapolis</GPE> and the river was covered with the squadrons of cavalry, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> hunters, tall and robust, who pursued their game without the apprehension of an enemy.
 On the opposite bank the ambassadors descried a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Armenian</NORP> horse, who appeared to guard the passage of the Euphrates.
 The tent of <GPE>Belisarius</GPE> was of the coarsest linen, the simple equipage of a warrior who disdained the luxury of the East.
 Around his tent, the nations who marched under his standard were arranged with skilful confusion.
 The <NORP>Thracians</NORP> and <NORP>Illyrians</NORP> were posted in the front, the <PERSON>Heruli</PERSON> and <NORP>Goths</NORP> in the centre; the prospect was closed by the <LOC>Moors</LOC> and Vandals, and their loose array seemed to multiply their numbers.
 Their dress was light and active; <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> soldier carried a whip, another a sword, a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> a bow, a fourth, perhaps, a battle axe, and the whole picture exhibited the intrepidity of the troops and the vigilance of the general.
 <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was deluded by the address, and awed by the genius, of the lieutenant of Justinian.
 Conscious of the merit, and ignorant of the force, of his antagonist, he dreaded a decisive battle in a distant country, from whence not a <NORP>Persian</NORP> might return to relate the melancholy tale.
 The great king hastened to repass the Euphrates; and <GPE>Belisarius</GPE> pressed his retreat, by affecting to oppose a measure so salutary to the empire, and which could scarcely have been prevented by an army of a hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men.
 Envy might suggest to ignorance and pride, that the public enemy had been suffered to escape: but the <NORP>African</NORP> and <NORP>Gothic</NORP> triumphs are less glorious than this safe and bloodless victory, in which neither fortune, nor the valour of the soldiers, can subtract any part of the general's renown.

 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> removal of <GPE>Belisarius</GPE> from the <NORP>Persian</NORP> to the <NORP>Italian</NORP> war revealed the extent of his personal merit, which had corrected or supplied the want of discipline and courage.
 <CARDINAL>Fifteen</CARDINAL> generals, without concert or skill, led through the mountains of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> an army of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Romans, inattentive to their signals, their ranks, and their ensigns.
 Four <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Persians, entrenched in the camp of Dubis, vanquished, almost without a combat, this disorderly multitude; their useless arms were scattered along the road, and their horses sunk under the fatigue of their rapid flight.
 But the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> party prevailed over their brethren; the <NORP>Armenians</NORP> returned to their allegiance; the cities of <PERSON>Dara</PERSON> and <GPE>Edessa</GPE> resisted a sudden assault and a regular siege, and the calamities of war were suspended by those of pestilence.
 A tacit or formal agreement between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sovereigns protected the tranquillity of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> frontier; and the arms of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> were confined to the <NORP>Colchian</NORP> or Lazic war, which has been too minutely described by the historians of the times.
 (64) Description of Colchos, Lazica, or Mingrelia.
 The extreme length of the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> Sea (65) from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to the mouth of the Phasis, may be computed as a voyage of nine days, and a measure of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 From the <NORP>Iberian</NORP> Caucasus, the most lofty and craggy mountains of Asia, that river descends with such oblique vehemence, that in a short space it is traversed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and twenty bridges.
 Nor does the stream become placid and navigable, till it reaches the town of Sarapana, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> days' journey from the Cyrus, which flows from the same hills, but in a contrary direction to the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> Lake.
 The proximity of these rivers has suggested the practice, or at least the idea, of wafting the precious merchandise of <GPE>India</GPE> down the Oxus, over the Caspian, up the Cyrus, and with the current of the <PERSON>Phasis</PERSON> into the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> and <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> Seas.
 As it successively collects the streams of the plain of Colchos, the <PERSON>Phasis</PERSON> moves with diminished speed, though accumulated weight.
 At the mouth it is <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> fathom deep, and <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> a league broad, but a small woody island is interposed in the midst of the channel; the water, so soon as it has deposited an earthy or metallic sediment, floats on the surface of the waves, and is no longer susceptible of corruption.
 In a course of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles, <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> of which are navigable for large vessels, the <PERSON>Phasis</PERSON> divides the celebrated region of Colchos, (66) or Mingrelia, (67) which, on <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sides, is fortified by the <NORP>Iberian</NORP> and <NORP>Armenian</NORP> mountains, and whose maritime coast extends about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred miles from the neighbourhood of <GPE>Trebizond</GPE> to <GPE>Dioscurias</GPE> and the confines of Circassia.
 Both the soil and climate are relaxed by excessive moisture: <CARDINAL>twenty-eight</CARDINAL> rivers, besides the <PERSON>Phasis</PERSON> and his dependent streams, convey their waters to the sea; and the hollowness of the ground appears to indicate the subterraneous channels between the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> and the Caspian.
 In the fields where wheat or barley is sown, the earth is too soft to sustain the action of the plough; but the gom, a small grain, not unlike the millet or coriander seed, supplies the ordinary food of the people; and the use of bread is confined to the prince and his nobles.
 Yet the vintage is more plentiful than the harvest; and the bulk of the stems, as well as the quality of the wine, display the unassisted powers of nature.
 The same powers continually tend to overshadow the face of the country with thick forests; the timber of the hills, and the flax of the plains, contribute to the abundance of naval stores; the wild and tame animals, the horse, the ox, and the hog, are remarkably prolific, and the name of the pheasant is expressive of his native habitation on the banks of the Phasis.
 The gold mines to the south of Trebizond, which are still worked with sufficient profit, were a subject of national dispute between <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and Chosroes; and it is not unreasonable to believe, that a vein of precious metal may be equally diffused through the circle of the hills, although these secret treasures are neglected by the laziness, or concealed by the prudence, of the Mingrelians.
 The waters, impregnated with particles of gold, are carefully strained through sheep-skins or fleeces; but this expedient, the groundwork perhaps of a marvellous fable, affords a faint image of the wealth extracted from a virgin earth by the power and industry of ancient kings.
 Their silver palaces and golden chambers surpass our belief; but the fame of their riches is said to have excited the enterprising avarice of the Argonauts.
 (68) Tradition has affirmed, with some colour of reason, that <GPE>Egypt</GPE> planted on the <PERSON>Phasis</PERSON> a learned and polite colony, (69) which manufactured linen, built navies, and invented geographical maps.
 The ingenuity of the moderns has peopled, with flourishing cities and nations, the isthmus between the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> and the Caspian; (70) and a lively writer, observing the resemblance of climate, and, in his apprehension, of trade, has not hesitated to pronounce <ORG>Colchos</ORG> the <GPE>Holland</GPE> of antiquity.
 (71) Manners of the natives.
 But the riches of <ORG>Colchos</ORG> shine only through the darkness of conjecture or tradition; and its genuine history presents a uniform scene of rudeness and poverty.
 If <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> languages were spoken in the market of Dioscurias, (72) they were the imperfect idioms of so many savage tribes or families, sequestered from each other in the valleys of Mount Caucasus; and their separation, which diminished the importance, must have multiplied the number, of their rustic capitals.
 In the present state of Mingrelia, a village is an assemblage of huts within a wooden fence; the fortresses are seated in the depths of forests; the princely town of Cyta, or Cotatis, consists of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred houses, and a stone edifice appertains only to the magnificence of kings.
 <CARDINAL>Twelve</CARDINAL> ships from Constantinople, and about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> barks, laden with the fruits of industry, annually cast anchor on the coast; and the list of <NORP>Colchian</NORP> exports is much increased, since the natives had only slaves and hides to offer in exchange for the corn and salt which they purchased from the subjects of Justinian.
 Not a vestige can be found of the art, the knowledge, or the navigation, of the ancient Colchians: few <NORP>Greeks</NORP> desired or dared to pursue the footsteps of the Argonauts; and even the marks of an <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> colony are lost on a nearer approach.
 The rite of circumcision is practised only by the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> of the Euxine; and the curled hair and swarthy complexion of <LOC>Africa</LOC> no longer disfigure the most perfect of the human race.
 It is in the adjacent climates of Georgia, Mingrelia, and Circassia, that nature has placed, at least to our eyes, the model of beauty in the shape of the limbs, the colour of the skin, the symmetry of the features, and the expression of the countenance.
 (73) According to the destination of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sexes, the men seemed formed for action, the women for love; and the perpetual supply of females from Mount <LOC>Caucasus</LOC> has purified the blood, and improved the breed, of the southern nations of Asia.
 The proper district of Mingrelia, a portion only of the ancient Colchos, has long sustained an exportation of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves.
 The number of prisoners or criminals would be inadequate to the <DATE>annual</DATE> demand; but the common people are in a state of servitude to their lords; the exercise of fraud or rapine is unpunished in a lawless community; and the market is continually replenished by the abuse of civil and paternal authority.
 Such a trade, (74) which reduces the human species to the level of cattle, may tend to encourage marriage and population, since the multitude of children enriches their sordid and inhuman parent.
 But this source of impure wealth must inevitably poison the national manners, obliterate the sense of honour and virtue, and almost extinguish the instincts of nature: the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of <GPE>Georgia</GPE> and <GPE>Mingrelia</GPE> are the most dissolute of mankind; and their children, who, in a tender age, are sold into foreign slavery, have already learned to imitate the rapine of the father and the prostitution of the mother.
 Yet, amidst the rudest ignorance, the untaught natives discover a singular dexterity both of mind and hand; and although the want of union and discipline exposes them to their more powerful neighbours, a bold and intrepid spirit has animated the <NORP>Colchians</NORP> of every age.
 In the host of Xerxes, they served on foot; and their arms were a dagger or a javelin, a wooden casque, and a buckler of raw hides.
 But in their own country the use of cavalry has more generally prevailed: the meanest of the peasants disdained to walk; the martial nobles are possessed, perhaps, of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred horses; and above <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> are numbered in the train of the prince of Mingrelia.
 The <NORP>Colchian</NORP> government has been always a pure and hereditary kingdom; and the authority of the sovereign is only restrained by the turbulence of his subjects.
 Whenever they were obedient, he could lead a numerous army into the field; but some faith is requisite to believe, that the single tribe of the <NORP>Suanians</NORP> as composed of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers, or that the population of <GPE>Mingrelia</GPE> now amounts to <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of inhabitants.
 (75) Revolutions of Colchos.
 It was the boast of the Colchians, that their ancestors had checked the victories of Sesostris; and the defeat of the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> is less incredible than his successful progress as far as the foot of Mount Caucasus.
 They sunk without any memorable effort, under the arms of Cyrus; followed in distant wars the standard of the great king, and presented him every fifth year with <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred boys, and as many virgins, the fairest produce of the land.
 (76)under the Persians, before Christ, 500; Yet he accepted this gift like the gold and ebony of India, the frankincense of the Arabs, or the negroes and ivory of Aethiopia: the <NORP>Colchians</NORP> were not subject to the dominion of a satrap, and they continued to enjoy the name as well as substance of national independence.
 (77) After the fall of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> empire, Mithridates, king of Pontus, added <ORG>Colchos</ORG> to the wide circle of his dominions on the Euxine; and when the natives presumed to request that his son might reign over them, he bound the ambitious youth in chains of gold, and delegated a servant in his place.
 In pursuit of Mithridates, under the Romans, before Christ, <CARDINAL>60</CARDINAL> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> advanced to the banks of the Phasis, and their galleys ascended the river till they reached the camp of <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> and his legions.
 (78) But the senate, and afterwards the emperors, disdained to reduce that distant and useless conquest into the form of a province.
 The family of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> rhetorician was permitted to reign in <ORG>Colchos</ORG> and the adjacent kingdoms from the time of Mark Antony to that of Nero; and after the race of <PERSON>Polemo</PERSON> (79) was extinct, the eastern Pontus, which preserved his name, extended no farther than the neighbourhood of Trebizond.
 Beyond these limits the fortifications of Hyssus, of Apsarus, of the Phasis, of <GPE>Dioscurias</GPE> or Sebastopolis, and of Pityus, were guarded by sufficient detachments of horse and foot; and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> princes of <ORG>Colchos</ORG> received their diadems from the lieutenants of Caesar.
 Visit of Arrian, A.
D.
 130.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of these lieutenants, the eloquent and philosophic Arrian, surveyed, and has described, the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> coast, under the reign of Hadrian.
 The garrison which he reviewed at the mouth of the <PERSON>Phasis</PERSON> consisted of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred chosen legionaries; the brick walls and towers, the double ditch, and the military engines on the rampart, rendered this place inaccessible to the Barbarians: but the new suburbs which had been built by the merchants and veterans, required, in the opinion of Arrian, some external defence.
 (80) As the strength of the empire was gradually impaired, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> stationed on the <PERSON>Phasis</PERSON> were either withdrawn or expelled; and the tribe of the Lazi, (81) whose posterity speak a foreign dialect, and inhabit the sea coast of Trebizond, imposed their name and dominion on the ancient kingdom of Colchos.
 Their independence was soon invaded by a formidable neighbour, who had acquired, by arms and treaties, the sovereignty of Iberia.
 The dependent king of <PERSON>Lazica</PERSON> received his sceptre at the hands of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch, and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> acquiesced in this injurious claim, which was proudly urged as a right of immemorial prescription.
 Conversion of the Lazi, A.
D.
 522.
 In the beginning of the sixth century, their influence was restored by the introduction of Christianity, which the <NORP>Mingrelians</NORP> still profess with becoming zeal, without understanding the doctrines, or observing the precepts, of their religion.
 After the decease of his father, <PERSON>Zathus</PERSON> was exalted to the regal dignity by the favour of the great king; but the pious youth abhorred the ceremonies of the Magi, and sought, in the palace of Constantinople, an orthodox baptism, a noble wife, and the alliance of the emperor Justin.
 The king of <PERSON>Lazica</PERSON> was solemnly invested with the diadem, and his cloak and tunic of white silk, with a gold border, displayed, in rich embroidery, the figure of his new patron; who soothed the jealousy of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> court, and excused the revolt of Colchos, by the venerable names of hospitality and religion.
 The common interest of both empires imposed on the <NORP>Colchians</NORP> the duty of guarding the passes of Mount Caucasus, where a wall of <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> miles is now defended by the <DATE>monthly</DATE> service of the musketeers of Mingrelia.
 (82) Revolt and repentance of the Colchians, A.
D.
 542-549.
 But this honourable connection was soon corrupted by the avarice and ambition of the Romans.
 Degraded from the rank of allies, the <PERSON>Lazi</PERSON> were incessantly reminded, by words and actions, of their dependent state.
 At the distance of a day's journey beyond the Apsarus, they beheld the rising fortress of Petra, (83) which commanded the maritime country to the south of the Phasis.
 Instead of being protected by the valour, <ORG>Colchos</ORG> was insulted by the licentiousness, of foreign mercenaries; the benefits of commerce were converted into base and vexatious monopoly; and Gubazes, the native prince, was reduced to a pageant of royalty, by the superior influence of the officers of Justinian.
 Disappointed in their expectations of <NORP>Christian</NORP> virtue, the indignant <PERSON>Lazi</PERSON> reposed some confidence in the justice of an unbeliever.
 After a private assurance that their ambassadors should not be delivered to the Romans, they publicly solicited the friendship and aid of Chosroes.
 The sagacious monarch instantly discerned the use and importance of Colchos; and meditated a plan of conquest, which was renewed at the end of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years by Shah Abbas, the wisest and most powerful of his successors.
 (84) His ambition was fired by the hope of launching a <NORP>Persian</NORP> navy from the Phasis, of commanding the trade and navigation of the <PRODUCT>Euxine</PRODUCT> Sea, of desolating the coast of <LOC>Pontus</LOC> and Bithynia, of distressing, perhaps of attacking, Constantinople, and of persuading the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of <LOC>Europe</LOC> to <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> his arms and counsels against the common enemy of mankind.
 Under the pretence of a <NORP>Scythian</NORP> war, he silently led his troops to the frontiers of Iberia; the <NORP>Colchian</NORP> guides were prepared to conduct them through the woods and along the precipices of Mount Caucasus; and a narrow path was laboriously formed into a safe and spacious highway, for the march of cavalry, and even of elephants.
 <PERSON>Gubazes</PERSON> laid his person and diadem at the feet of the king of Persia; his <NORP>Colchians</NORP> imitated the submission of their prince; and after the walls of <PERSON>Petra</PERSON> had been shaken, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> garrison prevented, by a capitulation, the impending fury of the last assault.
 But the <PERSON>Lazi</PERSON> soon discovered, that their impatience had urged them to choose an evil more intolerable than the calamities which they strove to escape.
 The monopoly of salt and corn was effectually removed by the loss of those valuable commodities.
 The authority of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> legislator, was succeeded by the pride of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> despot, who beheld, with equal disdain, the slaves whom he had exalted, and the kings whom he had humbled before the footstool of his throne.
 The adoration of fire was introduced into <ORG>Colchos</ORG> by the zeal of the Magi: their intolerant spirit provoked the fervour of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people; and the prejudice of nature or education was wounded by the impious practice of exposing the dead bodies of their parents, on the summit of a lofty tower, to the crows and vultures of the air.
 (85) Conscious of the increasing hatred, which retarded the execution of his great designs, the just <PERSON>Nashirvan</PERSON> had secretly given orders to assassinate the king of the Lazi, to transplant the people into some distant land, and to fix a faithful and warlike colony on the banks of the Phasis.
 The watchful jealousy of the <NORP>Colchians</NORP> foresaw and averted the approaching ruin.
 Their repentance was accepted at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by the prudence, rather than clemency, of Justinian; and he commanded Dagisteus, with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Romans, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the Zani, to expel the <NORP>Persians</NORP> from the coast of the Euxine.
 Siege of Petra, A.
D.
 549-551.
 The siege of Petra, which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, with the aid of the Lazi, immediately undertook, is <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most remarkable actions of the age.
 The city was seated on a craggy rock, which hung over the sea, and communicated by a steep and narrow path with the land.
 Since the approach was difficult, the attack might be deemed impossible: the <NORP>Persian</NORP> conqueror had strengthened the fortifications of Justinian; and the places least inaccessible were covered by additional bulwarks.
 In this important fortress, the vigilance of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> had deposited a magazine of offensive and defensive arms, sufficient for <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times the number, not only of the garrison, but of the besiegers themselves.
 The stock of flour and salt provisions was adequate to the consumption of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the want of wine was supplied by vinegar; and of grain from whence a strong liquor was extracted, and a triple aqueduct eluded the diligence, and even the suspicions, of the enemy.
 But the firmest defence of <PERSON>Petra</PERSON> was placed in the valour of fifteen hundred Persians, who resisted the assaults of the Romans, whilst, in a softer vein of earth, a mine was secretly perforated.
 The wall, supported by slender and temporary props, hung tottering in the air; but <PERSON>Dagisteus</PERSON> delayed the attack till he had secured a specific recompense; and the town was relieved before the return of his messenger from Constantinople.
 The <NORP>Persian</NORP> garrison was reduced to <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred men, of whom no more than fifty were exempt from sickness or wounds; yet such had been their inflexible perseverance, that they concealed their losses from the enemy, by enduring, without a murmur, the sight and putrefying stench of the dead bodies of their eleven hundred companions.
 After their deliverance, the breaches were hastily stopped with sand-bags; the mine was replenished with earth; a new wall was erected on a frame of substantial timber; and a fresh garrison of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men was stationed at <PERSON>Petra</PERSON> to sustain the labours of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> siege.
 The operations, both of the attack and defence, were conducted with skilful obstinacy; and each party derived useful lessons from the experience of their past faults.
 A battering-ram was invented, of light construction and powerful effect: it was transported and worked by the hands of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> soldiers; and as the stones were loosened by its repeated strokes, they were torn with long iron hooks from the wall.
 From those walls, a shower of darts was incessantly poured on the heads of the assailants; but they were most dangerously annoyed by a fiery composition of sulphur and bitumen, which in <ORG>Colchos</ORG> might with some propriety be named the oil of Medea.
 Of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Romans</NORP> who mounted the scaling-ladders, their general <PERSON>Bessas</PERSON> was the first, a gallant veteran of seventy years of age: the courage of their leader, his fall, and extreme danger, animated the irresistible effort of his troops; and their prevailing numbers oppressed the strength, without subduing the spirit, of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> garrison.
 The fate of these valiant men deserves to be more distinctly noticed.
 Seven hundred had perished in the siege, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred survived to defend the breach.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> and seventy were destroyed with fire and sword in the last assault; and if <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> were made prisoners, only eighteen among them were found without the marks of honourable wounds.
 The remaining <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred escaped into the citadel, which they maintained without any hopes of relief, rejecting the fairest terms of capitulation and service, till they were lost in the flames.
 They died in obedience to the commands of their prince; and such examples of loyalty and valour might excite their countrymen to deeds of equal despair and more prosperous event.
 The instant demolition of the works of <PERSON>Petra</PERSON> confessed the astonishment and apprehension of the conqueror.
 The Colchian, or Lazic war, A.
D.
 549-556.
 A <NORP>Spartan</NORP> would have praised and pitied the virtue of these heroic slaves; but the tedious warfare and alternate success of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> and <NORP>Persian</NORP> arms cannot detain the attention of posterity at the foot of Mount Caucasus.
 The advantages obtained by the troops of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> were more frequent and splendid; but the forces of the great king were continually supplied, till they amounted to <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> elephants and seventy <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men, including <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Scythian</NORP> allies, and above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dilemites, who descended by their free choice from the hills of Hyrcania, and were equally formidable in close or in distant combat.
 The siege of Archaeopolis, a name imposed or corrupted by the Greeks, was raised with some loss and precipitation; but the <NORP>Persians</NORP> occupied the passes of Iberia: <ORG>Colchos</ORG> was enslaved by their forts and garrisons; they devoured the scanty sustenance of the people; and the prince of the <PERSON>Lazi</PERSON> fled into the mountains.
 In the <NORP>Roman</NORP> camp, faith and discipline were unknown; and the independent leaders, who were invested with equal power, disputed with each other the preeminence of vice and corruption.
 The <NORP>Persians</NORP> followed, without a murmur, the commands of a single chief, who implicitly obeyed the instructions of their supreme lord.
 Their general was distinguished among the heroes of the <LOC>East</LOC> by his wisdom in council, and his valour in the field.
 The advanced age of Mermeroes, and the lameness of both his feet, could not diminish the activity of his mind, or even of his body; and, whilst he was carried in a litter in the front of battle, he inspired terror to the enemy, and a just confidence to the troops, who, under his banners, were always successful.
 After his death, the command devolved to Nacoragan, a proud satrap, who, in a conference with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> chiefs, had presumed to declare that he disposed of victory as absolutely as of the ring on his finger.
 Such presumption was the natural cause and forerunner of a shameful defeat.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> had been gradually repulsed to the edge of the sea-shore; and their last camp, on the ruins of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> colony of Phasis, was defended on all sides by strong entrenchments, the river, the Euxine, and a fleet of galleys.
 Despair united their counsels and invigorated their arms: they withstood the assault of the <NORP>Persians</NORP> and the flight of <PRODUCT>Nacoragan</PRODUCT> preceded or followed the slaughter of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of his bravest soldiers.
 He escaped from the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to fall into the hands of an unforgiving master who severely chastised the error of his own choice: the unfortunate general was flayed alive, and his skin, stuffed into the human form, was exposed on a mountain; a dreadful warning to those who might hereafter be entrusted with the fame and fortune of Persia.
 (86) Yet the prudence of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> insensibly relinquished the prosecution of the <NORP>Colchian</NORP> war, in the just persuasion, that it is impossible to reduce, or, at least, to hold a distant country against the wishes and efforts of its inhabitants.
 The fidelity of <PERSON>Gubazes</PERSON> sustained the most rigorous trials.
 He patiently endured the hardships of a savage life, and rejected with disdain, the specious temptations of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> court.
 The king of the <PERSON>Lazi</PERSON> had been educated in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion; his mother was the daughter of a senator; during his youth he had served <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years a silentiary of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace, (87) and the arrears of an unpaid salary were a motive of attachment as well as of complaint.
 But the long continuance of his sufferings extorted from him a naked representation of the truth; and truth was an unpardonable libel on the lieutenants of Justinian, who, amidst the delays of a ruinous war, had spared his enemies and trampled on his allies.
 Their malicious information persuaded the emperor that his faithless vassal already meditated a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> defection: an order was surprised to send him prisoner to Constantinople; a treacherous clause was inserted, that he might be lawfully killed in case of resistance; and Gubazes, without arms, or suspicion of danger, was stabbed in the security of a friendly interview.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> moments of rage and despair, the <NORP>Colchians</NORP> would have sacrificed their country and religion to the gratification of revenge.
 But the authority and eloquence of the wiser few obtained a salutary pause: the victory of the <PERSON>Phasis</PERSON> restored the terror of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms, and the emperor was solicitous to absolve his own name from the imputation of so foul a murder.
 A judge of senatorial rank was commissioned to inquire into the conduct and death of the king of the Lazi.
 He ascended a stately tribunal, encompassed by the ministers of justice and punishment: in the presence of both nations, this extraordinary cause was pleaded, according to the forms of civil jurisprudence, and some satisfaction was granted to an injured people, by the sentence and execution of the meaner criminals.
 (88) Negotiations and treaties between <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and Chosroes.
 A.
D.
 540-561.
 In peace, the king of <GPE>Persia</GPE> continually sought the pretences of a rupture: but no sooner had he taken up arms, than he expressed his desire of a safe and honourable treaty.
 During the fiercest hostilities, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> monarchs entertained a deceitful negotiation; and such was the superiority of Chosroes, that whilst he treated the <NORP>Roman</NORP> ministers with insolence and contempt, he obtained the most unprecedented honours for his own ambassadors at the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court.
 The successor of <PERSON>Cyrus</PERSON> assumed the majesty of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> sun, and graciously permitted his younger brother <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> to reign over the West, with the pale and reflected splendour of the moon.
 This gigantic style was supported by the pomp and eloquence of Isdigune, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the royal chamberlains.
 His wife and daughters, with a train of eunuchs and camels, attended the march of the ambassador: <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> satraps with golden diadems were numbered among his followers: he was guarded by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred horse, the most valiant of the Persians; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> governor of <PERSON>Dara</PERSON> wisely refused to admit more than twenty of this martial and hostile caravan.
 When <GPE>Isdigune</GPE> had saluted the emperor, and delivered his presents, he passed <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> months at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> without discussing any serious affairs.
 Instead of being confined to his palace, and receiving food and water from the hands of his keepers, the <NORP>Persian</NORP> ambassador, without spies or guards, was allowed to visit the capital; and the freedom of conversation and trade enjoyed by his domestics, offended the prejudices of an age which rigorously practised the law of nations, without confidence or courtesy.
 (89) By an unexampled indulgence, his interpreter, a servant below the notice of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, was seated, at the table of Justinian, by the side of his master: and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold might be assigned for the expense of his journey and entertainment.
 Yet the repeated labours of <GPE>Isdigune</GPE> could procure only a partial and imperfect truce, which was always purchased with the treasures, and renewed at the solicitation, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court Many years of fruitless desolation elapsed before <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> were compelled, by mutual lassitude, to consult the repose of their declining age.
 At a conference held on the frontier, each party, without expecting to gain credit, displayed the power, the justice, and the pacific intentions, of their respective sovereigns; but necessity and interest dictated the treaty of peace, which was concluded for a term of fifty years, diligently composed in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Persian</NORP> languages, and attested by the seals of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> interpreters.
 The liberty of commerce and religion was fixed and defined; the allies of the emperor and the great king were included in the same benefits and obligations; and the most scrupulous precautions were provided to prevent or determine the accidental disputes that might arise on the confines of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations.
 After twenty years of destructive though feeble war, the limits still remained without alteration; and <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was persuaded to renounce his dangerous claim to the possession or sovereignty of <ORG>Colchos</ORG> and its dependent states.
 Rich in the accumulated treasures of the East, he extorted from the <NORP>Romans</NORP> an <DATE>annual</DATE> payment of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and the smallness of the sum revealed the disgrace of a tribute in its naked deformity.
 In a previous debate, the chariot of Sesostris, and the wheel of fortune, were applied by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ministers of Justinian, who observed that the reduction of Antioch, and some <NORP>Syrian</NORP> cities, had elevated beyond measure the vain and ambitious spirit of the Barbarian.
According to the Orientals, the empire of <GPE>Nushirvan</GPE> extended from Ferganah, in Transoxiana, to <GPE>Yemen</GPE> or <GPE>Arabia</GPE> Faelix.
 He subdued the rebels of Hyrcania, reduced the provinces of <GPE>Cabul</GPE> and <GPE>Zablestan</GPE> on the banks of the Indus, broke the power of the Euthalites, terminated by an honourable treaty the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> war, and admitted the daughter of the great khan into the number of his lawful wives.
 Victorious and respected among the princes of Asia, he gave audience, in his palace of Madain, or Ctesiphon, to the ambassadors of the world.
 Their gifts or tributes, arms, rich garments, gems, slaves or aromatics, were humbly presented at the foot of his throne; and he condescended to accept from the king of <GPE>India</GPE> <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> quintals of the wood of aloes, a maid <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> cubits in height, and a carpet softer than silk, the skin, as it was reported, of an extraordinary serpent.
 (91) Conquest of the Abyssinians, A.
D.
 522.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> had been reproached for his alliance with the Aethiopians, as if he attempted to introduce a people of savage negroes into the system of civilized society.
 But the friends of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, the Axumites, or Abyssinians, may be always distinguished from the original natives of Africa.
 (92) The hand of nature has flattened the noses of the negroes, covered their heads with shaggy wool, and tinged their skin with inherent and indelible blackness.
 But the olive complexion of the Abyssinians, their hair, shape, and features, distinctly mark them as a colony of Arabs; and this descent is confirmed by the resemblance of language and manners the report of an ancient emigration, and the narrow interval between the shores of the Red Sea.
 <NORP>Christianity</NORP> had raised that nation above the level of <NORP>African</NORP> barbarism: (93) their intercourse with Egypt, and the successors of Constantine, (94) had communicated the rudiments of the arts and sciences; their vessels traded to the Isle of Ceylon, (95) and <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> kingdoms obeyed the <PERSON>Negus</PERSON> or supreme prince of Abyssinia.
 The independence of the Homerites, who reigned in the rich and happy Arabia, was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> violated by an <NORP>Aethiopian</NORP> conqueror: he drew his hereditary claim from the queen of Sheba, (96) and his ambition was sanctified by religious zeal.
 The Jews, powerful and active in exile, had seduced the mind of Dunaan, prince of the Homerites.
 They urged him to retaliate the persecution inflicted by the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> laws on their unfortunate brethren: some <NORP>Roman</NORP> merchants were injuriously treated; and several <NORP>Christians</NORP> of <PERSON>Negra</PERSON> (97) were honoured with the crown of martyrdom.
 (98) The churches of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> implored the protection of the <NORP>Abyssinian</NORP> monarch.
 The <PERSON>Negus</PERSON> passed the Red Sea with a fleet and army, deprived the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> proselyte of his kingdom and life, and extinguished a race of princes, who had ruled above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years the sequestered region of myrrh and frankincense.
 The conqueror immediately announced the victory of the gospel, requested an orthodox patriarch, and so warmly professed his friendship to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, that <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was flattered by the hope of diverting the silk trade through the channel of Abyssinia, and of exciting the forces of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> against the <NORP>Persian</NORP> king.
 Their alliance with Justinian, A.
D.
 533.
 Nonnosus, descended from a family of ambassadors, was named by the emperor to execute this important commission.
 He wisely declined the shorter, but more dangerous, road, through the sandy deserts of Nubia; ascended the Nile, embarked on the Red Sea, and safely landed at the <NORP>African</NORP> port of Adulis.
 From <PERSON>Adulis</PERSON> to the royal city of <GPE>Axume</GPE> is no more than fifty leagues, in a direct line; but the winding passes of the mountains detained the ambassador fifteen days; and as he traversed the forests, he saw, and vaguely computed, about <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> wild elephants.
 The capital, according to his report, was large and populous; and the village of <GPE>Axume</GPE> is still conspicuous by the regal coronations, by the ruins of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> temple, and by sixteen or seventeen obelisks inscribed with <NORP>Grecian</NORP> characters.
 (99) But the <PERSON>Negus</PERSON> gave audience in the open field, seated on a lofty chariot, which was drawn by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> elephants, superbly caparisoned, and surrounded by his nobles and musicians.
 He was clad in a linen garment and cap, holding in his hand <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> javelins and a light shield; and, although his nakedness was imperfectly covered, he displayed the <NORP>Barbaric</NORP> pomp of gold chains, collars, and bracelets, richly adorned with pearls and precious stones.
 The ambassador of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> knelt; the <PERSON>Negus</PERSON> raised him from the ground, embraced Nonnosus, kissed the seal, perused the letter, accepted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> alliance, and, brandishing his weapons, denounced implacable war against the worshipers of fire.
 But the proposal of the silk trade was eluded; and notwithstanding the assurances, and perhaps the wishes, of the Abyssinians, these hostile menaces evaporated without effect.
 The <NORP>Homerites</NORP> were unwilling to abandon their aromatic groves, to explore a sandy desert, and to encounter, after all their fatigues, a formidable nation from whom they had never received any personal injuries.
 Instead of enlarging his conquests, the king of <PERSON>Aethiopia</PERSON> was incapable of defending his possessions.
 Abrahah, the slave of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> merchant of Adulis, assumed the sceptre of the Homerites; the troops of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were seduced by the luxury of the climate; and <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> solicited the friendship of the usurper, who honoured with a slight tribute the supremacy of his prince.
 After a long series of prosperity, the power of <PERSON>Abrahah</PERSON> was overthrown before the gates of Mecca; and his children were despoiled by the <NORP>Persian</NORP> conqueror; and the <NORP>Aethiopians</NORP> were finally expelled from the continent of Asia.
 This narrative of obscure and remote events is not foreign to the decline and fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 If a <NORP>Christian</NORP> power had been maintained in Arabia, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> must have been crushed in his cradle, and <PERSON>Abyssinia</PERSON> would have prevented a revolution which has changed the civil and religious state of the world.
