 But the principle of discord was alive in their bosom, and they were more solicitous to explore the nature, than to practice the laws, of their founder.
 I have already observed, that the disputes of the TRINITY were succeeded by those of the INCARNATION; alike scandalous to the church, alike pernicious to the state, still more minute in their origin, still more durable in their effects.
 It is my design to comprise in the present chapter a religious war of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years, to represent the ecclesiastical and political schism of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> sects, and to introduce their clamorous or sanguinary contests, by a modest inquiry into the doctrines of the primitive church.
 (1) A pure man to the <NORP>Ebionites</NORP> I.
 A laudable regard for the honor of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> proselyte has countenanced the belief, the hope, the wish, that the Ebionites, or at least the Nazarenes, were distinguished only by their obstinate perseverance in the practice of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> rites.
 Their churches have disappeared, their books are obliterated: their obscure freedom might allow a latitude of faith, and the softness of their infant creed would be variously moulded by the zeal or prudence of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred years.
 Yet the most charitable criticism must refuse these sectaries any knowledge of the pure and proper divinity of Christ.
 Educated in the school of <NORP>Jewish</NORP> prophecy and prejudice, they had never been taught to elevate their hopes above a human and temporal Messiah.
 (2) If they had courage to hail their king when he appeared in a plebeian garb, their grosser apprehensions were incapable of discerning their God, who had studiously disguised his celestial character under the name and person of a mortal.
 (3) The familiar companions of <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> of <GPE>Nazareth</GPE> conversed with their friend and countryman, who, in all the actions of rational and animal life, appeared of the same species with themselves.
 His progress from infancy to youth and manhood was marked by a regular increase in stature and wisdom; and after a painful agony of mind and body, he expired on the cross.
 He lived and died for the service of mankind: but the life and death of <PERSON>Socrates</PERSON> had likewise been devoted to the cause of religion and justice; and although the stoic or the hero may disdain the humble virtues of Jesus, the tears which he shed over his friend and country may be esteemed the purest evidence of his humanity.
 The miracles of the gospel could not astonish a people who held with intrepid faith the more splendid prodigies of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> law.
 The prophets of ancient days had cured diseases, raised the dead, divided the sea, stopped the sun, and ascended to heaven in a fiery chariot.
 And the metaphorical style of the <NORP>Hebrews</NORP> might ascribe to a saint and martyr the adoptive title of SON OF GOD.
 His birth and elevation Yet in the insufficient creed of the <NORP>Nazarenes</NORP> and the Ebionites, a distinction is faintly noticed between the heretics, who confounded the generation of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> in the common order of nature, and the less guilty schismatics, who revered the virginity of his mother, and excluded the aid of an earthly father.
 The incredulity of the former was countenanced by the visible circumstances of his birth, the legal marriage of the reputed parents, <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> and Mary, and his lineal claim to the kingdom of <PERSON>David</PERSON> and the inheritance of Judah.
 But the secret and authentic history has been recorded in several copies of the <WORK_OF_ART>Gospel</WORK_OF_ART> according to St.
 Matthew, (4) which these sectaries long preserved in the original Hebrew, (5) as the sole evidence of their faith.
 The natural suspicions of the husband, conscious of his own chastity, were dispelled by the assurance (in a dream) that his wife was pregnant of the Holy Ghost: and as this distant and domestic prodigy could not fall under the personal observation of the historian, he must have listened to the same voice which dictated to <PERSON>Isaiah</PERSON> the future conception of a virgin.
 The son of a virgin, generated by the ineffable operation of the Holy Spirit, was a creature without example or resemblance, superior in every attribute of mind and body to the children of Adam.
 Since the introduction of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> or <NORP>Chaldean</NORP> philosophy, (6) the <NORP>Jews</NORP> (7) were persuaded of the preexistence, transmigration, and immortality of souls; and providence was justified by a supposition, that they were confined in their earthly prisons to expiate the stains which they had contracted in a former state.
 (8) But the degrees of purity and corruption are almost immeasurable.
 It might be fairly presumed, that the most sublime and virtuous of human spirits was infused into the offspring of <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> and the Holy Ghost; (9) that his abasement was the result of his voluntary choice; and that the object of his mission was, to purify, not his own, but the sins of the world.
 On his return to his native skies, he received the immense reward of his obedience; the everlasting kingdom of the Messiah, which had been darkly foretold by the prophets, under the carnal images of peace, of conquest, and of dominion.
 Omnipotence could enlarge the human faculties of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> to the extend of is celestial office.
 In the language of antiquity, the title of God has not been severely confined to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> parent, and his incomparable minister, his only-begotten son, might claim, without presumption, the religious, though secondary, worship of a subject of a subject world.
 A pure God to the <NORP>Docetes</NORP> II.
 The seeds of the faith, which had slowly arisen in the rocky and ungrateful soil of Judea, were transplanted, in full maturity, to the happier climes of the Gentiles; and the strangers of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Asia, who never beheld the manhood, were the more readily disposed to embrace the divinity, of Christ.
 The polytheist and the philosopher, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and the Barbarian, were alike accustomed to conceive a long succession, an infinite chain of angels or daemons, or deities, or aeons, or emanations, issuing from the throne of light.
 Nor could it seem strange or incredible, that the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these aeons, the Logos, or Word of God, of the same substance with the Father, should descend upon earth, to deliver the human race from vice and error, and to conduct them in the paths of life and immortality.
 But the prevailing doctrine of the eternity and inherent pravity of matter infected the primitive churches of the East.
 Many among the <NORP>Gentile</NORP> proselytes refused to believe that a celestial spirit, an undivided portion of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> essence, had been personally united with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh; and, in their zeal for the divinity, they piously abjured the humanity, of Christ.
 While his blood was still recent on Mount Calvary, (10) the Docetes, a numerous and learned sect of Asiatics, invented the phantastic system, which was afterwards propagated by the Marcionites, the Manichaeans, and the various names of the <NORP>Gnostic</NORP> heresy.
 (11) They denied the truth and authenticity of the Gospels, as far as they relate the conception of Mary, the birth of Christ, and the thirty years that preceded the exercise of his ministry.
 He <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> appeared on the banks of the <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> in the form of perfect manhood; but it was a form only, and not a substance; a human figure created by the hand of Omnipotence to imitate the faculties and actions of a man, and to impose a perpetual illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies.
 Articulate sounds vibrated on the ears of the disciples; but the image which was impressed on their optic nerve eluded the more stubborn evidence of the touch; and they enjoyed the spiritual, not the corporeal, presence of the Son of God.
 The rage of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> was idly wasted against an impassive phantom; and the mystic scenes of the passion and death, the resurrection and ascension, of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> were represented on the theatre of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> for the benefit of mankind.
 If it were urged, that such ideal mimicry, such incessant deception, was unworthy of the God of truth, the <NORP>Docetes</NORP> agreed with too many of their orthodox brethren in the justification of pious falsehood.
 In the system of the Gnostics, the Jehovah of Israel, the Creator of this lower world, was a rebellious, or at least an ignorant, spirit.
 The Son of God descended upon earth to abolish his temple and his law; and, for the accomplishment of this salutary end, he dexterously transferred to his own person the hope and prediction of a temporal Messiah.
 His incorruptible body.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the most subtile disputants of the <NORP>Manichaean</NORP> school has pressed the danger and indecency of supposing, that the God of the Christians, in the state of a human foetus, emerged at the end of <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> <DATE>months</DATE> from a female womb.
 The pious horror of his antagonists provoked them to disclaim all sensual circumstances of conception and delivery; to maintain that the divinity passed through <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> like a sunbeam through a plate of glass; and to assert, that the seal of her virginity remained unbroken even at the moment when she became the mother of Christ.
 But the rashness of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of those of the Docetes, who taught, not that <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was a phantom, but that he was clothed with an impassible and incorruptible body.
 Such, indeed, in the more orthodox system, he has acquired since his resurrection, and such he must have always possessed, if it were capable of pervading, without resistance or injury, the density of intermediate matter.
 Devoid of its most essential properties, it might be exempt from the attributes and infirmities of the flesh.
 A foetus that could increase from an invisible point to its full maturity; a child that could attain the stature of perfect manhood without deriving any nourishment from the ordinary sources, might continue to exist without repairing a daily waste by a daily supply of external matter.
 <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> might share the repasts of his disciples without being subject to the calls of thirst or hunger; and his virgin purity was never sullied by the involuntary stains of sensual concupiscence.
 Of a body thus singularly constituted, a question would arise, by what means, and of what materials, it was originally framed; and our sounder theology is startled by an answer which was not peculiar to the Gnostics, that both the form and the substance proceeded from the divine essence.
 The idea of pure and absolute spirit is a refinement of modern philosophy: the incorporeal essence, ascribed by the ancients to human souls, celestial beings, and even the Deity himself, does not exclude the notion of extended space; and their imagination was satisfied with a subtile nature of air, or fire, or aether, incomparably more perfect than the grossness of the material world.
 If we define the place, we must describe the figure, of the Deity.
 Our experience, perhaps our vanity, represents the powers of reason and virtue under a human form.
 The Anthropomorphites, who swarmed among the monks of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> of Africa, could produce the express declaration of Scripture, that man was made after the image of his Creator.
 (12) The venerable Serapion, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the saints of the <NORP>Nitrian</NORP> deserts, relinquished, with many a tear, his darling prejudice; and bewailed, like an infant, his unlucky conversion, which had stolen away his God, and left his mind without any visible object of faith or devotion.
 (13) Double nature of <PERSON>Cerinthus</PERSON> III.
 Such were the fleeting shadows of the Docetes.
 A more substantial, though less simple, hypothesis, was contrived by <PERSON>Cerinthus</PERSON> of Asia, (14) who dared to oppose the last of the apostles.
 Placed on the confines of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> and <NORP>Gentile</NORP> world, he labored to reconcile the <NORP>Gnostic</NORP> with the Ebionite, by confessing in the same <PERSON>Messiah</PERSON> the supernatural union of a man and a God; and this mystic doctrine was adopted with many fanciful improvements by Carpocrates, Basilides, and Valentine, (15) the heretics of the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> school.
 In their eyes, <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> of <GPE>Nazareth</GPE> was a mere mortal, the legitimate son of <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> and Mary: but he was the best and wisest of the human race, selected as the worthy instrument to restore upon earth the worship of the true and supreme Deity.
 When he was baptized in the Jordan, the Christ, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the aeons, the Son of God himself, descended on <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> in the form of a dove, to inhabit his mind, and direct his actions during the allotted period of his ministry.
 When the <PERSON>Messiah</PERSON> was delivered into the hands of the Jews, the Christ, an immortal and impassible being, forsook his earthly tabernacle, flew back to the pleroma or world of spirits, and left the solitary <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> to suffer, to complain, and to expire.
 But the justice and generosity of such a desertion are strongly questionable; and the fate of an innocent martyr, at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> impelled, and at length abandoned, by his divine companion, might provoke the pity and indignation of the profane.
 Their murmurs were variously silenced by the sectaries who espoused and modified the double system of Cerinthus.
 It was alleged, that when <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> was nailed to the cross, he was endowed with a miraculous apathy of mind and body, which rendered him insensible of his apparent sufferings.
 It was affirmed, that these momentary, though real, pangs would be abundantly repaid by the temporal reign of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years reserved for the <PERSON>Messiah</PERSON> in his kingdom of the new Jerusalem.
 It was insinuated, that if he suffered, he deserved to suffer; that human nature is never absolutely perfect; and that the cross and passion might serve to expiate the venial transgressions of the son of Joseph, before his mysterious union with the Son of God.
 (16) Divine incarnation of <PERSON>Apollinaris</PERSON> IV.
 All those who believe the immateriality of the soul, a specious and noble tenet, must confess, from their present experience, the incomprehensible union of mind and matter.
 A similar union is not inconsistent with a much higher, or even with the highest, degree of mental faculties; and the incarnation of an aeon or archangel, the most perfect of created spirits, does not involve any positive contradiction or absurdity.
 In the age of religious freedom, which was determined by the council of Nice, the dignity of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was measured by private judgment according to the indefinite rule of Scripture, or reason, or tradition.
 But when his pure and proper divinity had been established on the ruins of Arianism, the faith of the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> trembled on the edge of a precipice where it was impossible to recede, dangerous to stand, dreadful to fall and the manifold inconveniences of their creed were aggravated by the sublime character of their theology.
 They hesitated to pronounce; that God himself, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> person of an equal and consubstantial trinity, was manifested in the flesh; (17) that a being who pervades the universe, had been confined in the womb of Mary; that his eternal duration had been marked by the days, and months, and years of human existence; that the Almighty had been scourged and crucified; that his impassible essence had felt pain and anguish; that his omniscience was not exempt from ignorance; and that the source of life and immortality expired on Mount Calvary.
 These alarming consequences were affirmed with unblushing simplicity by Apollinaris, (18) bishop of Laodicea, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the luminaries of the church.
 The son of a learned grammarian, he was skilled in all the sciences of Greece; eloquence, erudition, and philosophy, conspicuous in the volumes of Apollinaris, were humbly devoted to the service of religion.
 The worthy friend of Athanasius, the worthy antagonist of Julian, he bravely wrestled with the <NORP>Arians</NORP> and Polytheists, and though he affected the rigor of geometrical demonstration, his commentaries revealed the literal and allegorical sense of the Scriptures.
 A mystery, which had long floated in the looseness of popular belief, was defined by his perverse diligence in a technical form; and he <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> proclaimed the memorable words, "One incarnate nature of Christ," which are still reechoed with hostile clamors in the churches of Asia, Egypt, and Aethiopia.
 He taught that the <PERSON>Godhead</PERSON> was united or mingled with the body of a man; and that the Logos, the eternal wisdom, supplied in the flesh the place and office of a human soul.
 Yet as the profound doctor had been terrified at his own rashness, <PERSON>Apollinaris</PERSON> was heard to mutter some faint accents of excuse and explanation.
 He acquiesced in the old distinction of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> philosophers between the rational and sensitive soul of man; that he might reserve the <WORK_OF_ART>Logos</WORK_OF_ART> for intellectual functions, and employ the subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life.
 With the moderate Docetes, he revered <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> as the spiritual, rather than as the carnal, mother of Christ, whose body either came from heaven, impassible and incorruptible, or was absorbed, and as it were transformed, into the essence of the Deity.
 The system of <PERSON>Apollinaris</PERSON> was strenuously encountered by the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> and <NORP>Syrian</NORP> divines whose schools are honored by the names of Basil, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> and Chrysostom, and tainted by those of Diodorus, Theodore, and Nestorius.
 But the person of the aged bishop of Laedicea, his character and dignity, remained inviolate; and his rivals, since we may not suspect them of the weakness of toleration, were astonished, perhaps, by the novelty of the argument, and diffident of the final sentence of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 Her judgment at length inclined in their favor; the heresy of <PERSON>Apollinaris</PERSON> was condemned, and the separate congregations of his disciples were proscribed by the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> laws.
 But his principles were secretly entertained in the monasteries of Egypt, and his enemies felt the hatred of <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> and Cyril, the successive patriarchs of Alexandria.
 <NORP>Orthodox</NORP> consent and verbal disputes.
 V.
 The grovelling Ebionite, and the fantastic Docetes, were rejected and forgotten: the recent zeal against the errors of <PERSON>Apollinaris</PERSON> reduced the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> to a seeming agreement with the double nature of Cerinthus.
 But instead of a temporary and occasional alliance, they established, and we still embrace, the substantial, indissoluble, and everlasting union of a perfect God with a perfect man, of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> person of the trinity with a reasonable soul and human flesh.
 In the beginning of the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> century, the unity of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> natures was the prevailing doctrine of the church.
 On all sides, it was confessed, that the mode of their coexistence could neither be represented by our ideas, nor expressed by our language.
 Yet a secret and incurable discord was cherished, between those who were most apprehensive of confounding, and those who were most fearful of separating, the divinity, and the humanity, of Christ.
 Impelled by religious frenzy, they fled with adverse haste from the error which they mutually deemed most destructive of truth and salvation.
 On either hand they were anxious to guard, they were jealous to defend, the union and the distinction of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> natures, and to invent such forms of speech, such symbols of doctrine, as were least susceptible of doubt or ambiguity.
 The poverty of ideas and language tempted them to ransack art and nature for every possible comparison, and each comparison mislead their fancy in the explanation of an incomparable mystery.
 In the polemic microscope, an atom is enlarged to a monster, and each party was skilful to exaggerate the absurd or impious conclusions that might be extorted from the principles of their adversaries.
 To escape from each other, they wandered through many a dark and devious thicket, till they were astonished by the horrid phantoms of <PERSON>Cerinthus</PERSON> and Apollinaris, who guarded the opposite issues of the theological labyrinth.
 As soon as they beheld the twilight of sense and heresy, they started, measured back their steps, and were again involved in the gloom of impenetrable orthodoxy.
 To purge themselves from the guilt or reproach of damnable error, they disavowed their consequences, explained their principles, excused their indiscretions, and unanimously pronounced the sounds of concord and faith.
 Yet a latent and almost invisible spark still lurked among the embers of controversy: by the breath of prejudice and passion, it was quickly kindled to a mighty flame, and the verbal disputes (19) of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> sects have shaken the pillars of the church and state.
 Cyril, patriach of Alexandria, A.
D.
 412, October 18- A.
D.
 444, June 27.
 The name of <PERSON>CYRIL</PERSON> of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> is famous in controversial story, and the title of saint is a mark that his opinions and his party have finally prevailed.
 In the house of his uncle, the archbishop Theophilus, he imbibed the orthodox lessons of zeal and dominion, and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years of his youth were profitably spent in the adjacent monasteries of Nitria.
 Under the tuition of the abbot Serapion, he applied himself to ecclesiastical studies, with such indefatigable ardor, that in the course of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> sleepless night, he has perused the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> Gospels, the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> Epistles, and the Epistle to the Romans.
 <PERSON>Origen</PERSON> he detested; but the writings of <PERSON>Clemens</PERSON> and Dionysius, of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> and Basil, were continually in his hands: by the theory and practice of dispute, his faith was confirmed and his wit was sharpened; he extended round his cell the cobwebs of scholastic theology, and meditated the works of allegory and metaphysics, whose remains, in <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> verbose folios, now peaceably slumber by the side of their rivals.
 (20) <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> prayed and fasted in the desert, but his thoughts (it is the reproach of a friend) (21) were still fixed on the world; and the call of Theophilus, who summoned him to the tumult of cities and synods, was too readily obeyed by the aspiring hermit.
 With the approbation of his uncle, he assumed the office, and acquired the fame, of a popular preacher.
 His comely person adorned the pulpit; the harmony of his voice resounded in the cathedral; his friends were stationed to lead or <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> the applause of the congregation; (22) and the hasty notes of the scribes preserved his discourses, which in their effect, though not in their composition, might be compared with those of the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> orators.
 The death of <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> expanded and realized the hopes of his nephew.
 The clergy of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> was divided; the soldiers and their general supported the claims of the archdeacon; but a resistless multitude, with voices and with hands, asserted the cause of their favorite; and after a period of thirty-nine years, <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> was seated on the throne of Athanasius.
 (23) His Tyranny, A.
D.
 413,414,415, etc The prize was not unworthy of his ambition.
 At a distance from the court, and at the head of an immense capital, the patriarch, as he was now styled, of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> had gradually usurped the state and authority of a civil magistrate.
 The public and private charities of the city were blindly obeyed by his numerous and fanatic parabolani , (24) familiarized in their daily office with scenes of death; and the praefects of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> were awed or provoked by the temporal power of these <NORP>Christian</NORP> pontiffs.
 Ardent in the prosecution of heresy, <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> auspiciously opened his reign by oppressing the Novatians, the most innocent and harmless of the sectaries.
 The interdiction of their religious worship appeared in his eyes a just and meritorious act; and he confiscated their holy vessels, without apprehending the guilt of sacrilege.
 The toleration, and even the privileges of the Jews, who had multiplied to the number of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> thousand, were secured by the laws of the <NORP>Caesars</NORP> and Ptolemies, and a long prescription of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred years since the foundation of Alexandria.
 Without any legal sentence, without any royal mandate, the patriarch, at the dawn of day, led a seditious multitude to the attack of the synagogues.
 Unarmed and unprepared, the <NORP>Jews</NORP> were incapable of resistance; their houses of prayer were levelled with the ground, and the episcopal warrior, after-rewarding his troops with the plunder of their goods, expelled from the city the remnant of the unbelieving nation.
 Perhaps he might plead the insolence of their prosperity, and their deadly hatred of the Christians, whose blood they had recently shed in a malicious or accidental tumult.
 Such crimes would have deserved the animadversion of the magistrate; but in this promiscuous outrage, the innocent were confounded with the guilty, and <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> was impoverished by the loss of a wealthy and industrious colony.
 The zeal of <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> exposed him to the penalties of the <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> law; but in a feeble government and a superstitious age, he was secure of impunity, and even of praise.
 <PERSON>Orestes</PERSON> complained; but his just complaints were too quickly forgotten by the ministers of Theodosius, and too deeply remembered by a priest who affected to pardon, and continued to hate, the praefect of Egypt.
 As he passed through the streets, his chariot was assaulted by a band of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred of the <NORP>Nitrian</NORP> monks his guards fled from the wild beasts of the desert; his protestations that he was a <NORP>Christian</NORP> and a <NORP>Catholic</NORP> were answered by a volley of stones, and the face of <PERSON>Orestes</PERSON> was covered with blood.
 The loyal citizens of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> hastened to his rescue; he instantly satisfied his justice and revenge against the monk by whose hand he had been wounded, and <PERSON>Ammonius</PERSON> expired under the rod of the lictor.
 At the command of <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> his body was raised from the ground, and transported, in solemn procession, to the cathedral; the name of <PERSON>Ammonius</PERSON> was changed to that of <PERSON>Thaumasius</PERSON> the wonderful ; his tomb was decorated with the trophies of martyrdom, and the patriarch ascended the pulpit to celebrate the magnanimity of an assassin and a rebel.
 Such honors might incite the faithful to combat and die under the banners of the saint; and he soon prompted, or accepted, the sacrifice of a virgin, who professed the religion of the Greeks, and cultivated the friendship of Orestes.
 Hypatia, the daughter of <PERSON>Theon</PERSON> the mathematician, (25) was initiated in her father's studies; her learned comments have elucidated the geometry of <NORP>Apollonius</NORP> and Diophantus, and she publicly taught, both at <GPE>Athens</GPE> and Alexandria, the philosophy of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> and Aristotle.
 In the bloom of beauty, and in the maturity of wisdom, the modest maid refused her lovers and instructed her disciples; the persons most illustrious for their rank or merit were impatient to visit the female philosopher; and <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> beheld, with a jealous eye, the gorgeous train of horses and slaves who crowded the door of her academy.
 A rumor was spread among the Christians, that the daughter of <PERSON>Theon</PERSON> was the only obstacle to the reconciliation of the praefect and the archbishop; and that obstacle was speedily removed.
 On a fatal day, in the holy season of Lent, <PERSON>Hypatia</PERSON> was torn from her chariot, stripped naked, dragged to the church, and inhumanly butchered by the hands of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> the reader, and a troop of savage and merciless fanatics: her flesh was scraped from her bones with sharp cyster shells, (26) and her quivering limbs were delivered to the flames.
 The just progress of inquiry and punishment was stopped by seasonable gifts; but the murder of <PERSON>Hypatia</PERSON> has imprinted an indelible stain on the character and religion of <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> of Alexandria.
 (27) Nestorius, patriarch of Constantinople, A.
D.
 428, April 10.
 Superstition, perhaps, would more gently expiate the blood of a virgin, than the banishment of a saint; and <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> had accompanied his uncle to the iniquitous synod of the Oak.
 When the memory of <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> was restored and consecrated, the nephew of Theophilus, at the head of a dying faction, still maintained the justice of his sentence; nor was it till after a tedious delay and an obstinate resistance, that he yielded to the consent of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> world.
 (28) His enmity to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> pontiffs (29) was a sense of interest, not a sally of passion: he envied their fortunate station in the sunshine of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court; and he dreaded their upstart ambition.
 which oppressed the metropolitans of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, invaded the provinces of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> and Alexandria, and measured their diocese by the limits of the empire.
 The long moderation of Atticus, the mild usurper of the throne of Chrysostom, suspended the animosities of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> patriarchs; but <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> was at length awakened by the exaltation of a rival more worthy of his esteem and hatred.
 After the short and troubled reign of Sisinnius, bishop of Constantinople, the factions of the clergy and people were appeased by the choice of the emperor, who, on this occasion, consulted the voice of fame, and invited the merit of a stranger.
 Nestorius, (30) native of Germanicia, and a monk of Antioch, was recommended by the austerity of his life, and the eloquence of his sermons; but the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> homily which he preached before the devout <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> betrayed the acrimony and impatience of his zeal.
 On the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> day as if the treaty had been already signed, the patriarch of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> discovered, surprised, and attacked a secret conventicle of the Arians: they preferred death to submission; the flames that were kindled by their despair, soon spread to the neighboring houses, and the triumph of <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> was clouded by the name of incendiary .
 On either side of the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> his episcopal vigour imposed a rigid formulary of faith and discipline; a chronological error concerning the festival of <EVENT>Easter</EVENT> was punished as an offence against the church and state.
 <GPE>Lydia</GPE> and Caria, <PERSON>Sardes</PERSON> and Miletus, were purified with the blood of the obstinate Quartodecimans; and the edict of the emperor, or rather of the patriarch, enumerates three-and-twenty degrees and denominations in the guilt and punishment of heresy.
 (31) But the sword of persecution which <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> so furiously wielded was soon turned against his own breast.
 Religion was the pretence; but, in the judgment of a contemporary saint, ambition was the genuine motive of episcopal warfare.
 (32) His heresy, A.
D.
 429-431.
 In the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> school, <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> had been taught to abhor the confusion of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> natures, and nicely to discriminate the humanity of his master <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> from the divinity of the Lord Jesus.
 (33) The Blessed <LOC>Virgin</LOC> he revered as the mother of Christ, but his ears were offended with the rash and recent title of mother of God, (34) which had been insensibly adopted since the origin of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> controversy.
 From the pulpit of Constantinople, a friend of the patriarch, and afterwards the patriarch himself, repeatedly preached against the use, or the abuse, of a word (35) unknown to the apostles, unauthorized by the church, and which could only tend to alarm the timorous, to mislead the simple, to amuse the profane, and to justify, by a seeming resemblance, the old genealogy of Olympus.
 (36) In his calmer moments <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> confessed, that it might be tolerated or excused by the union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> natures, and the communication of their idioms : (37) but he was exasperated, by contradiction, to disclaim the worship of a new-born, an infant Deity, to draw his inadequate similes from the conjugal or civil partnerships of life, and to describe the manhood of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> as the robe, the instrument, the tabernacle of his Godhead.
 At these blasphemous sounds, the pillars of the sanctuary were shaken.
 The unsuccessful competitors of <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> indulged their pious or personal resentment, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> clergy was secretly displeased with the intrusion of a stranger: whatever is superstitious or absurd, might claim the protection of the monks; and the people were interested in the glory of their virgin patroness.
 (38) The sermons of the archbishop, and the service of the altar, were disturbed by seditious clamor; his authority and doctrine were renounced by separate congregations; every wind scattered round the empire the leaves of controversy; and the voice of the combatants on a sonorous theatre reechoed in the cells of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> and Egypt.
 It was the duty of <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> to enlighten the zeal and ignorance of his innumerable monks: in the school of Alexandria, he had imbibed and professed the incarnation of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> nature; and the successor of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> consulted his pride and ambition, when he rose in arms against another Arius, more formidable and more guilty, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> throne of the hierarchy.
 After a short correspondence, in which the rival prelates disguised their hatred in the hollow language of respect and charity, the patriarch of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> denounced to the prince and people, to the <LOC>East</LOC> and to the West, the damnable errors of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> pontiff.
 From the East, more especially from Antioch, he obtained the ambiguous counsels of toleration and silence, which were addressed to both parties while they favored the cause of Nestorius.
 But the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> received with open arms the messengers of Egypt.
 The vanity of <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> was flattered by the appeal; and the partial version of a monk decided the faith of the pope, who with his <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy was ignorant of the language, the arts, and the theology of the Greeks.
 At the head of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> synod, <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> weighed the merits of the cause, approved the creed of Cyril, condemned the sentiments and person of Nestorius, degraded the heretic from his episcopal dignity, allowed a respite of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days for recantation and penance, and delegated to his enemy the execution of this rash and illegal sentence.
 But the patriarch of Alexandria, while he darted the thunders of a god, exposed the errors and passions of a mortal; and his <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> anathemas (39) still torture the orthodox slaves, who adore the memory of a saint, without forfeiting their allegiance to the synod of Chalcedon.
 These bold assertions are indelibly tinged with the colors of the <NORP>Apollinarian</NORP> heresy; but the serious, and perhaps the sincere professions of <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> have satisfied the wiser and less partial theologians of the present times.
 (40) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> council of Ephesus, A.
D.
 431, June-October.
 Yet neither the emperor nor the primate of the <LOC>East</LOC> were disposed to obey the mandate of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> priest; and a synod of the Catholic, or rather of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church, was unanimously demanded as the sole remedy that could appease or decide this ecclesiastical quarrel.
 (41) Ephesus, on all sides accessible by sea and land, was chosen for the place, the festival of <EVENT>Pentecost</EVENT> for the day, of the meeting; a writ of summons was despatched to each metropolitan, and a guard was stationed to protect and confine the fathers till they should settle the mysteries of heaven, and the faith of the earth.
 <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> appeared not as a criminal, but as a judge; be depended on the weight rather than the number of his prelates, and his sturdy slaves from the baths of <PRODUCT>Zeuxippus</PRODUCT> were armed for every service of injury or defence.
 But his adversary <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> was more powerful in the weapons both of the flesh and of the spirit.
 Disobedient to the letter, or at least to the meaning, of the royal summons, he was attended by <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> bishops, who expected from their patriarch's nod the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
 He had contracted an intimate alliance with Memnon, bishop of Ephesus.
 The despotic primate of <LOC>Asia</LOC> disposed of the ready succors of thirty or <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> episcopal votes: a crowd of peasants, the slaves of the church, was poured into the city to support with blows and clamors a metaphysical argument; and the people zealously asserted the honor of the Virgin, whose body reposed within the walls of Ephesus.
 (42) The fleet which had transported <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> from <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> was laden with the riches of Egypt; and he disembarked a numerous body of mariners, slaves, and fanatics, enlisted with blind obedience under the banner of St.
 Mark and the mother of God.
 The fathers, and even the guards, of the council were awed by this martial array; the adversaries of <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> and <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> were insulted in the streets, or threatened in their houses; his eloquence and liberality made a daily increase in the number of his adherents; and the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> soon computed that he might command the attendance and the voices of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred bishops.
 (43) But the author of the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> anathemas foresaw and dreaded the opposition of <PERSON>John</PERSON> of Antioch, who, with a small, but respectable, train of metropolitans and divines, was advancing by slow journeys from the distant capital of the East.
 Impatient of a delay, which he stigmatized as voluntary and culpable, (44) <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> announced the opening of the synod sixteen days after the festival of Pentecost.
 Nestorius, who depended on the near approach of his <NORP>Eastern</NORP> friends, persisted, like his predecessor Chrysostom, to disclaim the jurisdiction, and to disobey the summons, of his enemies: they hastened his trial, and his accuser presided in the seat of judgment.
 <CARDINAL>Sixty-eight</CARDINAL> bishops, <CARDINAL>twenty-two</CARDINAL> of metropolitan rank, defended his cause by a modest and temperate protest: they were excluded from the councils of their brethren.
 Candidian, in the emperor's name, requested a delay of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> days; Condemnation of Nestorius, June 22.
 the profane magistrate was driven with outrage and insult from the assembly of the saints.
 The whole of this momentous transaction was crowded into the compass of a summer's day: the bishops delivered their separate opinions; but the uniformity of style reveals the influence or the hand of a master, who has been accused of corrupting the public evidence of their acts and subscriptions.
 (45) Without a dissenting voice, they recognized in the epistles of <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> the Nicene creed and the doctrine of the fathers: but the partial extracts from the letters and homilies of <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> were interrupted by curses and anathemas: and the heretic was degraded from his episcopal and ecclesiastical dignity.
 The sentence, maliciously inscribed to the new Judas, was affixed and proclaimed in the streets of Ephesus: the weary prelates, as they issued from the church of the mother of God, were saluted as her champions; and her victory was celebrated by the illuminations, the songs, and the tumult of the night.
 Opposition of the Orientals, June 27, etc On the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> day, the triumph was clouded by the arrival and indignation of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> bishops.
 In a chamber of the inn, before he had wiped the dust from his shoes, <PERSON>John</PERSON> of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> gave audience to Candidian, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> minister; who related his ineffectual efforts to prevent or to annul the hasty violence of the Egyptian.
 With equal haste and violence, the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> synod of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> bishops degraded <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> and <PERSON>Memnon</PERSON> from their episcopal honors, condemned, in the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> anathemas, the purest venom of the <NORP>Apollinarian</NORP> heresy, and described the <NORP>Alexandrian</NORP> primate as a monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church.
 (46) His throne was distant and inaccessible; but they instantly resolved to bestow on the flock of <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> the blessing of a faithful shepherd.
 By the vigilance of Memnon, the churches were shut against them, and a strong garrison was thrown into the cathedral.
 The troops, under the command of Candidian, advanced to the assault; the outguards were routed and put to the sword, but the place was impregnable: the besiegers retired; their retreat was pursued by a vigorous sally; they lost their horses, and many of their soldiers were dangerously wounded with clubs and stones.
 Ephesus, the city of the Virgin, was defiled with rage and clamor, with sedition and blood; the rival synods darted anathemas and excommunications from their spiritual engines; and the court of <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> was perplexed by the adverse and contradictory narratives of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> and <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> factions.
 During a busy period of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months, the emperor tried every method, except the most effectual means of indifference and contempt, to reconcile this theological quarrel.
 He attempted to remove or intimidate the leaders by a common sentence, of acquittal or condemnation; he invested his representatives at <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> with ample power and military force; he summoned from either party <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> chosen deputies to a free and candid conference in the neighborhood of the capital, far from the contagion of popular frenzy.
 But the <NORP>Orientals</NORP> refused to yield, and the Catholics, proud of their numbers and of their <NORP>Latin</NORP> allies, rejected all terms of union or toleration.
 The patience of the meek <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> was provoked; and he dissolved in anger this episcopal tumult, Third Council which at the distance of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> centuries assumes the venerable aspect of the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> ecumenical council.
 (47) They returned to their provinces; but the same passions which had distracted the synod of <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> were diffused over the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> world.
 After <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> obstinate and equal campaigns, <PERSON>John</PERSON> of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> and <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> condescended to explain and embrace: but their seeming reunion must be imputed rather to prudence than to reason, to the mutual lassitude rather than to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> charity of the patriarchs.
 Victory of Cyril, A.
D.
 431- <CARDINAL>435</CARDINAL> The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> pontiff had instilled into the royal ear a baleful prejudice against the character and conduct of his <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> rival.
 An epistle of menace and invective, (48) which accompanied the summons, accused him as a busy, insolent, and envious priest, who perplexed the simplicity of the faith, violated the peace of the church and state, and, by his artful and separate addresses to the wife and sister of Theodosius, presumed to suppose, or to scatter, the seeds of discord in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> family.
 At the stern command of his sovereign.
 <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> had repaired to Ephesus, where he was resisted, threatened, and confined, by the magistrates in the interest of <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> and the Orientals; who assembled the troops of <GPE>Lydia</GPE> and <GPE>Ionia</GPE> to suppress the fanatic and disorderly train of the patriarch.
 Without expecting the royal license, he escaped from his guards, precipitately embarked, deserted the imperfect synod, and retired to his episcopal fortress of safety and independence.
 But his artful emissaries, both in the court and city, successfully labored to appease the resentment, and to conciliate the favor, of the emperor.
 The feeble son of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> was alternately swayed by his wife and sister, by the eunuchs and women of the palace: superstition and avarice were their ruling passions; and the orthodox chiefs were assiduous in their endeavors to alarm the former, and to gratify the latter.
 <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the suburbs were sanctified with frequent monasteries, and the holy abbots, <PERSON>Dalmatius</PERSON> and Eutyches, (49) had devoted their zeal and fidelity to the cause of Cyril, the worship of Mary, and the unity of Christ.
 From the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> moment of their monastic life, they had never mingled with the world, or trod the profane ground of the city.
 But in this awful moment of the danger of the church, their vow was superseded by a more sublime and indispensable duty.
 At the head of a long order of monks and hermits, who carried burning tapers in their hands, and chanted litanies to the mother of God, they proceeded from their monasteries to the palace.
 The people was edified and inflamed by this extraordinary spectacle, and the trembling monarch listened to the prayers and adjurations of the saints, who boldly pronounced, that none could hope for salvation, unless they embraced the person and the creed of the orthodox successor of Athanasius.
 At the same time, every avenue of the throne was assaulted with gold.
 Under the decent names of eulogies and benedictions , the courtiers of both sexes were bribed according to the measure of their power and rapaciousness.
 But their incessant demands despoiled the sanctuaries of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Alexandria; and the authority of the patriarch was unable to silence the just murmur of his clergy, that a debt of sixty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds had already been contracted to support the expense of this scandalous corruption.
 (50) Pulcheria, who relieved her brother from the weight of an empire, was the firmest pillar of orthodoxy; and so intimate was the alliance between the thunders of the synod and the whispers of the court, that <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> was assured of success if he could displace <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> eunuch, and substitute another in the favor of Theodosius.
 Yet the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> could not boast of a glorious or decisive victory.
 The emperor, with unaccustomed firmness, adhered to his promise of protecting the innocence of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> bishops; and <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> softened his anathemas, and confessed, with ambiguity and reluctance, a twofold nature of Christ, before he was permitted to satiate his revenge against the unfortunate Nestorius.
 (51) Exile of Nestorius, A.
D.
 435.
 The rash and obstinate Nestorius, before the end of the synod, was oppressed by Cyril, betrayed by the court, and faintly supported by his <NORP>Eastern</NORP> friends.
 A sentiment or fear or indignation prompted him, while it was yet time, to affect the glory of a voluntary abdication: (52) his wish, or at least his request, was readily granted; he was conducted with honor from <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> to his old monastery of Antioch; and, after a short pause, his successors, <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> and Proclus, were acknowledged as the lawful bishops of Constantinople.
 But in the silence of his cell, the degraded patriarch could no longer resume the innocence and security of a private monk.
 The past he regretted, he was discontented with the present, and the future he had reason to dread: the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> bishops successively disengaged their cause from his unpopular name, and each day decreased the number of the schismatics who revered <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> as the confessor of the faith.
 After a residence at <GPE>Antioch</GPE> of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the hand of <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> subscribed an edict, (53) which ranked him with <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> the magician, proscribed his opinions and followers, condemned his writings to the flames, and banished his person <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to Petra, in Arabia, and at length to Oasis, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the islands of the <NORP>Libyan</NORP> desert.
 (54) Secluded from the church and from the world, the exile was still pursued by the rage of bigotry and war.
 A wandering tribe of the <NORP>Blemmyes</NORP> or <NORP>Nubians</NORP> invaded his solitary prison: in their retreat they dismissed a crowd of useless captives: but no sooner had <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> reached the banks of the Nile, than he would gladly have escaped from a <NORP>Roman</NORP> and orthodox city, to the milder servitude of the savages.
 His flight was punished as a new crime: the soul of the patriarch inspired the civil and ecclesiastical powers of Egypt; the magistrates, the soldiers, the monks, devoutly tortured the enemy of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and St.
 Cyril; and, as far as the confines of Aethiopia, the heretic was alternately dragged and recalled, till his aged body was broken by the hardships and accidents of these reiterated journeys.
 Yet his mind was still independent and erect; the president of <GPE>Thebais</GPE> was awed by his pastoral letters; he survived the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> tyrant of Alexandria, and, after sixteen years' banishment, the synod of <PERSON>Chalcedon</PERSON> would perhaps have restored him to the honors, or at least to the communion, of the church.
 The death of <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> prevented his obedience to their welcome summons; (55) and his disease might afford some color to the scandalous report, that his tongue, the organ of blasphemy, had been eaten by the worms.
 He was buried in a city of Upper Egypt, known by the names of Chemnis, or Panopolis, or Akmim; (56) but the immortal malice of the <PERSON>Jacobites</PERSON> has persevered for ages to cast stones against his sepulchre, and to propagate the foolish tradition, that it was never watered by the rain of heaven, which equally descends on the righteous and the ungodly.
 (57) Humanity may drop a tear on the fate of Nestorius; yet justice must observe, that he suffered the persecution which he had approved and inflicted.
 (58) Heresy of Eutyches, A.
D.
 448.
 The death of the <NORP>Alexandrian</NORP> primate, after a reign of thirty-two years, abandoned the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> to the intemperance of zeal and the abuse of victory.
 (59) The monophysite doctrine (one incarnate nature) was rigorously preached in the churches of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the monasteries of the East; the primitive creed of <PERSON>Apollinarius</PERSON> was protected by the sanctity of Cyril; and the name of Eutyches, his venerable friend, has been applied to the sect most adverse to the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> heresy of Nestorius.
 His rival <PERSON>EUTYCHES</PERSON> was the abbot, or archimandrite, or superior of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred monks, but the opinions of a simple and illiterate recluse might have expired in the cell, where he had slept above seventy years, if the resentment or indiscretion of Flavian, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> pontiff, had not exposed the scandal to the eyes of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world.
 His domestic synod was instantly convened, their proceedings were sullied with clamor and artifice, and the aged heretic was surprised into a seeming confession, that <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> had not derived his body from the substance of the <LOC>Virgin</LOC> Mary.
 From their partial decree, <ORG>Eutyches</ORG> appealed to a general council; and his cause was vigorously asserted by his godson Chrysaphius, the reigning eunuch of the palace, and his accomplice Dioscorus, who had succeeded to the throne, the creed, the talents, and the vices, of the nephew of Theophilus.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> council of Ephesus, A.
D.
 449, August 8-11.
 By the special summons of Theodosius, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> synod of <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> was judiciously composed of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> metropolitans and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> bishops from each of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> dioceses of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire: some exceptions of favor or merit enlarged the number to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and thirty-five; and the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> Barsumas, as the chief and representative of the monks, was invited to sit and vote with the successors of the apostles.
 But the despotism of the <NORP>Alexandrian</NORP> patriarch again oppressed the freedom of debate: the same spiritual and carnal weapons were again drawn from the arsenals of Egypt: the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> veterans, a band of archers, served under the orders of Dioscorus; and the more formidable monks, whose minds were inaccessible to reason or mercy, besieged the doors of the cathedral.
 The general, and, as it should seem, the unconstrained voice of the fathers, accepted the faith and even the anathemas of Cyril; and the heresy of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> natures was formally condemned in the persons and writings of the most learned Orientals.
 The innocence and sanctity of <ORG>Eutyches</ORG> were acknowledged without hesitation; but the prelates, more especially those of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Asia, were unwilling to depose their patriarch for the use or even the abuse of his lawful jurisdiction.
 They embraced the knees of Dioscorus, as he stood with a threatening aspect on the footstool of his throne, and conjured him to forgive the offences, and to respect the dignity, of his brother.
 At these words a furious multitude of monks and soldiers, with staves, and swords, and chains, burst into the church; the trembling bishops hid themselves behind the altar, or under the benches, and as they were not inspired with the zeal of martyrdom, they successively subscribed a blank paper, which was afterwards filled with the condemnation of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> pontiff.
 <PERSON>Flavian</PERSON> was instantly delivered to the wild beasts of this spiritual amphitheatre: the monks were stimulated by the voice and example of <NORP>Barsumas</NORP> to avenge the injuries of Christ: it is said that the patriarch of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> reviled, and buffeted, and kicked, and trampled his brother of Constantinople: (61) it is certain, that the victim, before he could reach the place of his exile, expired on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day of the wounds and bruises which he had received at Ephesus.
 This <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> synod has been justly branded as a gang of robbers and assassins; yet the accusers of <PERSON>Dioscorus</PERSON> would magnify his violence, to alleviate the cowardice and inconstancy of their own behavior.
 Council of Chalcedon, A.
D.
 451, October 8-November 1.
 The faith of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> had prevailed: but the vanquished party was supported by the same pope who encountered without fear the hostile rage of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> and Genseric.
 The theology of Leo, his famous tome or epistle on the mystery of the incarnation, had been disregarded by the synod of Ephesus: his authority, and that of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church, was insulted in his legates, who escaped from slavery and death to relate the melancholy tale of the tyranny of <PERSON>Dioscorus</PERSON> and the martyrdom of Flavian.
 His provincial synod annulled the irregular proceedings of Ephesus; but as this step was itself irregular, he solicited the convocation of a general council in the free and orthodox provinces of Italy.
 From his independent throne, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> bishop spoke and acted without danger as the head of the Christians, and his dictates were obsequiously transcribed by <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> and her son Valentinian; who addressed their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> colleague to restore the peace and unity of the church.
 But the pageant of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> royalty was moved with equal dexterity by the hand of the eunuch; and <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> could pronounce, without hesitation, that the church was already peaceful and triumphant, and that the recent flame had been extinguished by the just punishment of the Nestorians.
 Perhaps the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> would be still involved in the heresy of the Monophysites, if the emperor's horse had not fortunately stumbled; <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> expired; his orthodox sister Pulcheria, with a nominal husband, succeeded to the throne; <PERSON>Chrysaphius</PERSON> was burnt, <PERSON>Dioscorus</PERSON> was disgraced, the exiles were recalled, and the tome of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> was subscribed by the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> bishops.
 Yet the pope was disappointed in his favorite project of a <NORP>Latin</NORP> council: he disdained to preside in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> synod, which was speedily assembled at <GPE>Nice</GPE> in Bithynia; his legates required in a peremptory tone the presence of the emperor; and the weary fathers were transported to <PERSON>Chalcedon</PERSON> under the immediate eye of <PERSON>Marcian</PERSON> and the senate of Constantinople.
 A quarter of a mile from the Thracian Bosphorus, the church of St.
 Euphemia was built on the summit of a gentle though lofty ascent: the triple structure was celebrated as a prodigy of art, and the boundless prospect of the land and sea might have raised the mind of a sectary to the contemplation of the God of the universe.
 Six hundred and thirty bishops were ranged in order in the nave of the church; but the patriarchs of the <LOC>East</LOC> were preceded by the legates, of whom the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> was a simple priest; and the place of honor was reserved for <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> laymen of consular or senatorian rank.
 The gospel was ostentatiously displayed in the centre, but the rule of faith was defined by the <ORG>Papal</ORG> and <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, who moderated the <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> sessions of the council of Chalcedon.
 (62) Their partial interposition silenced the intemperate shouts and execrations, which degraded the episcopal gravity; but, on the formal accusation of the legates, <PERSON>Dioscorus</PERSON> was compelled to descend from his throne to the rank of a criminal, already condemned in the opinion of his judges.
 The Orientals, less adverse to <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> than to Cyril, accepted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> as their deliverers: Thrace, and Pontus, and Asia, were exasperated against the murderer of Flavian, and the new patriarchs of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and <GPE>Antioch</GPE> secured their places by the sacrifice of their benefactor.
 The bishops of Palestine, Macedonia, and Greece, were attached to the faith of Cyril; but in the face of the synod, in the heat of the battle, the leaders, with their obsequious train, passed from the right to the left wing, and decided the victory by this seasonable desertion.
 Of the <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> suffragans who sailed from Alexandria, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> were tempted from their allegiance, and the thirteen, falling prostrate on the ground, implored the mercy of the council, with sighs and tears, and a pathetic declaration, that, if they yielded, they should be massacred, on their return to Egypt, by the indignant people.
 A tardy repentance was allowed to expiate the guilt or error of the accomplices of Dioscorus: but their sins were accumulated on his head; he neither asked nor hoped for pardon, and the moderation of those who pleaded for a general amnesty was drowned in the prevailing cry of victory and revenge.
 To save the reputation of his late adherents, some personal offences were skilfully detected; his rash and illegal excommunication of the pope, and his contumacious refusal (while he was detained a prisoner) to attend to the summons of the synod.
 Witnesses were introduced to prove the special facts of his pride, avarice, and cruelty; and the fathers heard with abhorrence, that the alms of the church were lavished on the female dancers, that his palace, and even his bath, was open to the prostitutes of Alexandria, and that the infamous Pansophia, or Irene, was publicly entertained as the concubine of the patriarch.
 (63) Faith of <PERSON>Chalcedon</PERSON> For these scandalous offences, <PERSON>Dioscorus</PERSON> was deposed by the synod, and banished by the emperor; but the purity of his faith was declared in the presence, and with the tacit approbation, of the fathers.
 Their prudence supposed rather than pronounced the heresy of Eutyches, who was never summoned before their tribunal; and they sat silent and abashed, when a bold <NORP>Monophysite</NORP> casting at their feet a volume of Cyril, challenged them to anathematize in his person the doctrine of the saint.
 If we fairly peruse the acts of <PERSON>Chalcedon</PERSON> as they are recorded by the orthodox party, (64) we shall find that a great majority of the bishops embraced the simple unity of Christ; and the ambiguous concession that he was formed Of or From <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> natures, might imply either their previous existence, or their subsequent confusion, or some dangerous interval between the conception of the man and the assumption of the God.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> theology, more positive and precise, adopted the term most offensive to the ears of the Egyptians, that <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> existed In <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> natures; and this momentous particle (65) (which the memory, rather than the understanding, must retain) had almost produced a schism among the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> bishops.
 The tome of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> had been respectfully, perhaps sincerely, subscribed; but they protested, in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> successive debates, that it was neither expedient nor lawful to transgress the sacred landmarks which had been fixed at Nice, Constantinople, and Ephesus, according to the rule of <WORK_OF_ART>Scripture</WORK_OF_ART> and tradition.
 At length they yielded to the importunities of their masters; but their infallible decree, after it had been ratified with deliberate votes and vehement acclamations, was overturned in the next session by the opposition of the legates and their <NORP>Oriental</NORP> friends.
 It was in vain that a multitude of episcopal voices repeated in chorus, The legates threatened, the emperor was absolute, and a committee of <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> bishops prepared a new decree, which was imposed on the reluctant assembly.
 In the name of the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> general council, the <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> person, but in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> natures, was announced to the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> world: an invisible line was drawn between the heresy of <PERSON>Apollinaris</PERSON> and the faith of St.
 Cyril; and the road to paradise, a bridge as sharp as a razor, was suspended over the abyss by the master-hand of the theological artist.
 During <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> centuries of blindness and servitude, <LOC>Europe</LOC> received her religious opinions from the oracle of the Vatican; and the same doctrine, already varnished with the rust of antiquity, was admitted without dispute into the creed of the reformers, who disclaimed the supremacy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 The synod of <PERSON>Chalcedon</PERSON> still triumphs in the <NORP>Protestant</NORP> churches; but the ferment of controversy has subsided, and the most pious <NORP>Christians</NORP> of the present day are ignorant, or careless, of their own belief concerning the mystery of the incarnation.
 Discord of the East, A.
D.
 451-482.
 Far different was the temper of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> under the orthodox reigns of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> and Marcian.
 Those pious emperors enforced with arms and edicts the symbol of their faith; (67) and it was declared by the conscience or honor of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred bishops, that the decrees of the synod of <PERSON>Chalcedon</PERSON> might be lawfully supported, even with blood.
 The <NORP>Catholics</NORP> observed with satisfaction, that the same synod was odious both to the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> and the Monophysites; (68) but the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> were less angry, or less powerful, and the <LOC>East</LOC> was distracted by the obstinate and sanguinary zeal of the Monophysites.
 <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> was occupied by an army of monks; in the name of the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> incarnate nature, they pillaged, they burnt, they murdered; the sepulchre of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was defiled with blood; and the gates of the city were guarded in tumultuous rebellion against the troops of the emperor.
 After the disgrace and exile of Dioscorus, the <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> still regretted their spiritual father; and detested the usurpation of his successor, who was introduced by the fathers of Chalcedon.
 The throne of <PERSON>Proterius</PERSON> was supported by a guard of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers: he waged a <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years' war against the people of Alexandria; and on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of the death of Marcian, he became the victim of their zeal.
 On the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day before the festival of Easter, the patriarch was besieged in the cathedral, and murdered in the baptistery.
 The remains of his mangled corpse were delivered to the flames, and his ashes to the wind; and the deed was inspired by the vision of a pretended angel: an ambitious monk, who, under the name of Timothy the Cat, (69) succeeded to the place and opinions of Dioscorus.
 This deadly superstition was inflamed, on either side, by the principle and the practice of retaliation: in the pursuit of a metaphysical quarrel, many thousands (70) were slain, and the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of every degree were deprived of the substantial enjoyments of social life, and of the invisible gifts of baptism and the holy communion.
 Perhaps an extravagant fable of the times may conceal an allegorical picture of these fanatics, who tortured each other and themselves.
 The <WORK_OF_ART>Henoticon</WORK_OF_ART> of Zeno, A.
D.
 482.
 The disorders of thirty years at length produced the famous <PERSON>HENOTICON</PERSON> (72) of the emperor Zeno, which in his reign, and in that of Anastasius, was signed by all the bishops of the East, under the penalty of degradation and exile, if they rejected or infringed this salutary and fundamental law.
 The clergy may smile or groan at the presumption of a layman who defines the articles of faith; yet if he stoops to the humiliating task, his mind is less infected by prejudice or interest, and the authority of the magistrate can only be maintained by the concord of the people.
 It is in ecclesiastical story, that <PERSON>Zeno</PERSON> appears least contemptible; and I am not able to discern any <NORP>Manichaean</NORP> or <NORP>Eutychian</NORP> guilt in the generous saying of Anastasius.
 That it was unworthy of an emperor to persecute the worshippers of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and the citizens of Rome.
 The <WORK_OF_ART>Henoticon</WORK_OF_ART> was most pleasing to the Egyptians; yet the smallest blemish has not been described by the jealous, and even jaundiced eyes of our orthodox schoolmen, and it accurately represents the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> faith of the incarnation, without adopting or disclaiming the peculiar terms of tenets of the hostile sects.
 A solemn anathema is pronounced against <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> and Eutyches; against all heretics by whom <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> is divided, or confounded, or reduced to a phantom.
 Without defining the number or the article of the word nature , the pure system of St.
 Cyril, the faith of Nice, Constantinople, and Ephesus, is respectfully confirmed; but, instead of bowing at the name of the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> council, the subject is dismissed by the censure of all contrary doctrines, if any such have been taught either elsewhere or at Chalcedon.
 Under this ambiguous expression, the friends and the enemies of the last synod might unite in a silent embrace.
 The most reasonable <NORP>Christians</NORP> acquiesced in this mode of toleration; but their reason was feeble and inconstant, and their obedience was despised as timid and servile by the vehement spirit of their brethren.
 On a subject which engrossed the thoughts and discourses of men, it was difficult to preserve an exact neutrality; a book, a sermon, a prayer, rekindled the flame of controversy; and the bonds of communion were alternately broken and renewed by the private animosity of the bishops.
 The space between <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> and <ORG>Eutyches</ORG> was filled by a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> shades of language and opinion; the acephali (73) of Egypt, and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiffs, of equal valor, though of unequal strength, may be found at the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> extremities of the theological scale.
 The acephali, without a king or a bishop, were separated above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred years from the patriarchs of Alexandria, who had accepted the communion of Constantinople, without exacting a formal condemnation of the synod of Chalcedon.
 For accepting the communion of Alexandria, without a formal approbation of the same synod, the patriarchs of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> were anathematized by the popes.
 Their inflexible despotism involved the most orthodox of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> churches in this spiritual contagion, denied or doubted the validity of their sacraments, (74) and fomented, thirty-five years, the schism of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, till they finally abolished the memory of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> pontiffs, who had dared to oppose the supremacy of St.
 Peter.
 (75) Before that period, the precarious truce of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and <GPE>Egypt</GPE> had been violated by the zeal of the rival prelates.
 Macedonius, who was suspected of the <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> heresy, asserted, in disgrace and exile, the synod of Chalcedon, while the successor of <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> would have purchased its overthrow with a bribe of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold.
 The <WORK_OF_ART>Trisagion</WORK_OF_ART> and religious war, till the death of Anastasius, A.
D.
 508-518.
 In the fever of the times, the sense, or rather the sound of a syllable, was sufficient to disturb the peace of an empire.
 The TRISAGION (76) (thrice holy,) "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!" is supposed, by the Greeks, to be the identical hymn which the angels and cherubim eternally repeat before the throne of God, and which, about the middle of the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> century, was miraculously revealed to the church of Constantinople.
 The devotion of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> soon added, "who was crucified for us!" and this grateful address, either to <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> alone, or to the whole Trinity, may be justified by the rules of theology, and has been gradually adopted by the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West.
 But it had been imagined by a <NORP>Monophysite</NORP> bishop; (77) the gift of an enemy was at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rejected as a dire and dangerous blasphemy, and the rash innovation had nearly cost the emperor <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> his throne and his life.
 (78) The people of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was devoid of any rational principles of freedom; but they held, as a lawful cause of rebellion, the color of a livery in the races, or the colour of a mystery in the schools.
 The Trisagion, with and without this obnoxious addition, was chanted in the cathedral by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> adverse choirs, and when their lungs were exhausted, they had recourse to the more solid arguments of sticks and stones; the aggressors were punished by the emperor, and defended by the patriarch; and the crown and mitre were staked on the event of this momentous quarrel.
 The streets were instantly crowded with innumerable swarms of men, women, and children; the legions of monks, in regular array, marched, and shouted, and fought at their head, Such was the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> cry; and the galleys of <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> lay upon their oars before the palace, till the patriarch had pardoned his penitent, and hushed the waves of the troubled multitude.
 The triumph of <PERSON>Macedonius</PERSON> was checked by a speedy exile; but the zeal of his flock was again exasperated by the same question, "Whether <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <ORG>Trinity</ORG> had been crucified?" On this momentous occasion, the blue and green factions of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> suspended their discord, and the civil and military powers were annihilated in their presence.
 The keys of the city, and the standards of the guards, were deposited in the forum of Constantine, the principal station and camp of the faithful.
 Day and night they were incessantly busied either in singing hymns to the honor of their God, or in pillaging and murdering the servants of their prince.
 The head of his favorite monk, the friend, as they styled him, of the enemy of the Holy Trinity, was borne aloft on a spear; and the firebrands, which had been darted against heretical structures, diffused the undistinguishing flames over the most orthodox buildings.
 The statues of the emperor were broken, and his person was concealed in a suburb, till, at the end of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days, he dared to implore the mercy of his subjects.
 Without his diadem, and in the posture of a suppliant, <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> appeared on the throne of the circus.
 The Catholics, before his face, rehearsed their genuine Trisagion; they exulted in the offer, which he proclaimed by the voice of a herald, of abdicating the purple; they listened to the admonition, that, since all could not reign, they should previously agree in the choice of a sovereign; and they accepted the blood of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> unpopular ministers, whom their master, without hesitation, condemned to the lions.
 These furious but transient seditions were encouraged by the success of Vitalian, who, with an army of <NORP>Huns</NORP> and Bulgarians, for the most part idolaters, declared himself the champion of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> faith.
 In this pious rebellion he depopulated Thrace, besieged Constantinople, exterminated sixty-five <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of his fellow-Christians, till he obtained the recall of the bishops, the satisfaction of the pope, and the establishment of the council of Chalcedon, an orthodox treaty, reluctantly signed by the dying Anastasius, and more faithfully performed by the uncle of Justinian.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> religious war, A.
D.
 514 And such was the event of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the religious wars which have been waged in the name and by the disciples, of the God of peace.
 (79) Theological character and government of Justinian, A.
D.
 519-565.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> has been already seen in the various lights of a prince, a conqueror, and a lawgiver: the theologian (80) still remains, and it affords an unfavorable prejudice, that his theology should form a very prominent feature of his portrait.
 The sovereign sympathized with his subjects in their superstitious reverence for living and departed saints: his Code, and more especially his Novels, confirm and enlarge the privileges of the clergy; and in every dispute between a monk and a layman, the partial judge was inclined to pronounce, that truth, and innocence, and justice, were always on the side of the church.
 In his public and private devotions, the emperor was assiduous and exemplary; his prayers, vigils, and fasts, displayed the austere penance of a monk; his fancy was amused by the hope, or belief, of personal inspiration; he had secured the patronage of the <LOC>Virgin</LOC> and St.
 Michael the archangel; and his recovery from a dangerous disease was ascribed to the miraculous succor of the holy martyrs <PERSON>Cosmas</PERSON> and Damian.
 The capital and the provinces of the <LOC>East</LOC> were decorated with the monuments of his religion; (81) and though the far greater part of these costly structures may be attributed to his taste or ostentation, the zeal of the royal architect was probably quickened by a genuine sense of love and gratitude towards his invisible benefactors.
 Among the titles of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> greatness, the name of <PERSON>Pious</PERSON> was most pleasing to his ear; to promote the temporal and spiritual interest of the church was the serious business of his life; and the duty of father of his country was often sacrificed to that of defender of the faith.
 The controversies of the times were congenial to his temper and understanding and the theological professors must inwardly deride the diligence of a stranger, who cultivated their art and neglected his own.
 The fruits of these lucubrations were displayed in many a conference, where <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> might shine as the loudest and most subtile of the disputants; in many a sermon, which, under the name of edicts and epistles, proclaimed to the empire the theology of their master.
 While the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> invaded the provinces, while the victorious legion marched under the banners of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> and Narses, the successor of Trajan, unknown to the camp, was content to vanquish at the head of a synod.
 Had he invited to these synods a disinterested and rational spectator, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> might have learned, " that religious controversy is the offspring of arrogance and folly; that true piety is most laudably expressed by silence and submission; that man, ignorant of his own nature, should not presume to scrutinize the nature of his God; and that it is sufficient for us to know, that power and benevolence are the perfect attributes of the Deity.
" (83) His persecution Toleration was not the virtue of the times, and indulgence to rebels has seldom been the virtue of princes.
 But when the prince descends to the narrow and peevish character of a disputant, he is easily provoked to supply the defect of argument by the plenitude of power, and to chastise without mercy the perverse blindness of those who wilfully shut their eyes against the light of demonstration.
 The reign of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was a uniform yet various scene of persecution; and he appears to have surpassed his indolent predecessors, both in the contrivance of his laws and the rigor of their execution.
 The insufficient term of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <DATE>months</DATE> was assigned for the conversion or exile of of heretics all heretics; (84) and if he still connived at their precarious stay, they were deprived, under his iron yoke, not only of the benefits of society, but of the common birth-right of men and Christians.
 At the end of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred years, the Montanists of <LOC>Phrygia</LOC> (85) still breathed the wild enthusiasm of perfection and prophecy which they had imbibed from their male and female apostles, the special organs of the Paraclete.
 On the approach of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> priests and soldiers, they grasped with alacrity the crown of martyrdom the conventicle and the congregation perished in the flames, but these primitive fanatics were not extinguished <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred years after the death of their tyrant.
 Under the protection of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> confederates, the church of the <NORP>Arians</NORP> at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had braved the severity of the laws: their clergy equalled the wealth and magnificence of the senate; and the gold and silver which were seized by the rapacious hand of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> might perhaps be claimed as the spoils of the provinces, and the trophies of the Barbarians.
 A secret remnant of <NORP>Pagans</NORP> of Pagans, who still lurked in the most refined and most rustic conditions of mankind, excited the indignation of the Christians, who were perhaps unwilling that any strangers should be the witnesses of their intestine quarrels.
 A bishop was named as the inquisitor of the faith, and his diligence soon discovered, in the court and city, the magistrates, lawyers, physicians, and sophists, who still cherished the superstition of the Greeks.
 They were sternly informed that they must choose without delay between the displeasure of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> or Justinian, and that their aversion to the gospel could no longer be distinguished under the scandalous mask of indifference or impiety.
 The patrician Photius, perhaps, alone was resolved to live and to die like his ancestors: he enfranchised himself with the stroke of a dagger, and left his tyrant the poor consolation of exposing with ignominy the lifeless corpse of the fugitive.
 His weaker brethren submitted to their earthly monarch, underwent the ceremony of baptism, and labored, by their extraordinary zeal, to erase the suspicion, or to expiate the guilt, of idolatry.
 The native country of Homer, and the theatre of the Trojan war, still retained the last sparks of his mythology: by the care of the same bishop, seventy <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Pagans</NORP> were detected and converted in Asia, Phrygia, Lydia, and Caria; <CARDINAL>ninety-six</CARDINAL> churches were built for the new proselytes; and linen vestments, Bibles, and liturgies, and vases of gold and silver, were supplied by the pious munificence of Justinian.
 (86) of Jews; The Jews, who had been gradually stripped of their immunities, were oppressed by a vexatious law, which compelled them to observe the festival of <EVENT>Easter</EVENT> the same day on which it was celebrated by the Christians.
 (87) And they might complain with the more reason, since the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> themselves did not agree with the astronomical calculations of their sovereign: the people of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> delayed the beginning of their <EVENT>Lent</EVENT> a whole week after it had been ordained by authority; and they had the pleasure of fasting <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days, while meat was exposed for sale by the command of the emperor.
 of <NORP>Samaritans</NORP> The <NORP>Samaritans</NORP> of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> (88) were a motley race, an ambiguous sect, rejected as <NORP>Jews</NORP> by the Pagans, by the <NORP>Jews</NORP> as schismatics, and by the <NORP>Christians</NORP> as idolaters.
 The abomination of the cross had already been planted on their holy mount of Garizim, (89) but the persecution of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> offered only the alternative of baptism or rebellion.
 They chose the latter: under the standard of a desperate leader, they rose in arms, and retaliated their wrongs on the lives, the property, and the temples, of a defenceless people.
 The <NORP>Samaritans</NORP> were finally subdued by the regular forces of the East: <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> were slain, <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> were sold by the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> to the infidels of <GPE>Persia</GPE> and India, and the remains of that unhappy nation atoned for the crime of treason by the sin of hypocrisy.
 It has been computed that <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> subjects were extirpated in the Samaritan war, (90) which converted the once fruitful province into a desolate and smoking wilderness.
 But in the creed of Justinian, the guilt of murder could not be applied to the slaughter of unbelievers; and he piously labored to establish with fire and sword the unity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith.
 (91) His orthodoxy With these sentiments, it was incumbent on him, at least, to be always in the right.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> years of his administration, he signalized his zeal as the disciple and patron of orthodoxy: the reconciliation of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> established the tome of St.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> as the creed of the emperor and the empire; the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> and <NORP>Eutychians</NORP> were exposed.
 on either side, to the double edge of persecution; and the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> synods of Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, were ratified by the code of a <NORP>Catholic</NORP> lawgiver.
 (92) But while <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> strove to maintain the uniformity of faith and worship, his wife Theodora, whose vices were not incompatible with devotion, had listened to the <NORP>Monophysite</NORP> teachers; and the open or clandestine enemies of the church revived and multiplied at the smile of their gracious patroness.
 The capital, the palace, the nuptial bed, were torn by spiritual discord; yet so doubtful was the sincerity of the royal consorts, that their seeming disagreement was imputed by many to a secret and mischievous confederacy against the religion and happiness of their people.
 (93) The famous dispute of the A.
D.
 532-698.
 <CARDINAL>THREE</CARDINAL> CHAPTERS, (94) which has filled more volumes than it deserves lines, is deeply marked with this subtile and disingenuous spirit.
 It was now <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred years since the body of <PERSON>Origen</PERSON> (95) had been eaten by the worms: his soul, of which he held the preexistence, was in the hands of its Creator; but his writings were eagerly perused by the monks of Palestine.
 In these writings, the piercing eye of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> descried more than <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> metaphysical errors; and the primitive doctor, in the company of <PERSON>Pythagoras</PERSON> and Plato, was devoted by the clergy to the eternity of hell-fire, which he had presumed to deny.
 Under the cover of this precedent, a treacherous blow was aimed at the council of Chalcedon.
 The fathers had listened without impatience to the praise of <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> of Mopsuestia; (96) and their justice or indulgence had restored both <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> of Cyrrhus, and <PERSON>Ibas</PERSON> of Edessa, to the communion of the church.
 But the characters of these <NORP>Oriental</NORP> bishops were tainted with the reproach of heresy; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> had been the master, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> others were the friends, of Nestorius; their most suspicious passages were accused under the title of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> chapters; and the condemnation of their memory must involve the honor of a synod, whose name was pronounced with sincere or affected reverence by the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> world.
 If these bishops, whether innocent or guilty, were annihilated in the sleep of death, they would not probably be awakened by the clamor which, after the a hundred years, was raised over their grave.
 If they were already in the fangs of the daemon, their torments could neither be aggravated nor assuaged by human industry.
 If in the company of saints and angels they enjoyed the rewards of piety, they must have smiled at the idle fury of the theological insects who still crawled on the surface of the earth.
 The foremost of these insects, the emperor of the Romans, darted his sting, and distilled his venom, perhaps without discerning the true motives of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> and her ecclesiastical faction.
 The victims were no longer subject to his power, and the vehement style of his edicts could only proclaim their damnation, and invite the clergy of the <LOC>East</LOC> to join in a full chorus of curses and anathemas.
 Vth general council:IId of Constantinople, A.
D.
 553, May 4-June 2.
 The East, with some hesitation, consented to the voice of her sovereign: the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> general council, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> patriarchs and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty-five bishops, was held at Constantinople; and the authors, as well as the defenders, of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> chapters were separated from the communion of the saints, and solemnly delivered to the prince of darkness.
 But the <NORP>Latin</NORP> churches were more jealous of the honor of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> and the synod of Chalcedon: and if they had fought as they usually did under the standard of Rome, they might have prevailed in the cause of reason and humanity.
 But their chief was a prisoner in the hands of the enemy; the throne of St.
 Peter, which had been disgraced by the simony, was betrayed by the cowardice, of Vigilius, who yielded, after a long and inconsistent struggle, to the despotism of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and the sophistry of the Greeks.
 His apostasy provoked the indignation of the Latins, and no more than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bishops could be found who would impose their hands on his deacon and successor Pelagius.
 Yet the perseverance of the popes insensibly transferred to their adversaries the appellation of schismatics; the Illyrian, African, and <NORP>Italian</NORP> churches were oppressed by the civil and ecclesiastical powers, not without some effort of military force; (97) the distant <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> transcribed the creed of the Vatican, and, in the period of a century, the schism of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> chapters expired in an obscure angle of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> province.
 (98) But the religious discontent of the <NORP>Italians</NORP> had already promoted the conquests of the Lombards, and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves were accustomed to suspect the faith and to detest the government of their <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> tyrant.
 Heresy of Justinian, A.
D.
 564.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was neither steady nor consistent in the nice process of fixing his volatile opinions and those of his subjects.
 In his youth he was, offended by the slightest deviation from the orthodox line; in his old age he transgressed the measure of temperate heresy, and the Jacobites, not less than the Catholics, were scandalized by his declaration, that the body of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was incorruptible, and that his manhood was never subject to any wants and infirmities, the inheritance of our mortal flesh.
 This phantastic opinion was announced in the last edicts of Justinian; and at the moment of his seasonable departure, the clergy had refused to subscribe, the prince was prepared to persecute, and the people were resolved to suffer or resist.
 A bishop of Treves, secure beyond the limits of his power, addressed the monarch of the <LOC>East</LOC> in the language of authority and affection.
 He died and made no sign.
 (99) His death restored in some degree the peace of the church, and the reigns of his <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> successors, Justin Tiberius, Maurice, and Phocas, are distinguished by a rare, though fortunate, vacancy in the ecclesiastical history of the East.
 (100) The <NORP>Monothelite</NORP> controversy, A.
D.
 629.
 The faculties of sense and reason are least capable of acting on themselves; the eye is most inaccessible to the sight, the soul to the thought; yet we think, and even feel, that <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> will, a sole principle of action, is essential to a rational and conscious being.
 When <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> returned from the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war, the orthodox hero consulted his bishops, whether the <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> whom he adored, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> person, but of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> natures, was actuated by a single or a double will.
 They replied in the singular, and the emperor was encouraged to hope that the <PERSON>Jacobites</PERSON> of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and <GPE>Syria</GPE> might be reconciled by the profession of a doctrine, most certainly harmless, and most probably true, since it was taught even by the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> themselves.
 (101) The experiment was tried without effect, and the timid or vehement <NORP>Catholics</NORP> condemned even the semblance of a retreat in the presence of a subtle and audacious enemy.
 The orthodox (the prevailing) party devised new modes of speech, and argument, and interpretation: to either nature of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> they speciously applied a proper and distinct energy; but the difference was no longer visible when they allowed that the human and the divine will were invariably the same.
 (102) The disease was attended with the customary symptoms: but the <NORP>Greek</NORP> clergy, as if satiated with the endless controversy of the incarnation, instilled a healing counsel into the ear of the prince and people.
 They declared themselves MONOTHELITES, (asserters of the unity of will,) but they treated the words as new, the questions as superfluous; and recommended a religious silence as the most agreeable to the prudence and charity of the gospel.
 The ecthesis of Heraclius, A.
D.
 639.
 This law of silence was successively imposed by the ecthesis or exposition of Heraclius, the A.
D.
 648 type or model of his grandson Constans; (103) and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> edicts were subscribed with alacrity or reluctance by the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> patriarchs of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch.
 But the bishop and monks of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> sounded the alarm: in the language, or even in the silence, of the Greeks, the <NORP>Latin</NORP> churches detected a latent heresy: and the obedience of Pope Honorius to the commands of his sovereign was retracted and censured by the bolder ignorance of his successors.
 They condemned the execrable and abominable heresy of the Monothelites, who revived the errors of Manes, Apollinaris, Eutyches, etc.
; they signed the sentence of excommunication on the tomb of St.
 Peter; the ink was mingled with the sacramental wine, the blood of Christ; and no ceremony was omitted that could fill the superstitious mind with horror and affright.
 As the representative of the <NORP>Western</NORP> church, Pope Martin and his <NORP>Lateran</NORP> synod anathematized the perfidious and guilty silence of the Greeks: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> bishops of Italy, for the most part the subjects of Constans, presumed to reprobate his wicked type, and the impious ecthesis of his grandfather; and to confound the authors and their adherents with the <CARDINAL>twenty-one</CARDINAL> notorious heretics, the apostates from the church, and the organs of the devil.
 Such an insult under the tamest reign could not pass with impunity.
 Pope Martin ended his days on the inhospitable shore of the Tauric Chersonesus, and his oracle, the abbot Maximus, was inhumanly chastised by the amputation of his tongue and his right hand.
 (104) But the same invincible spirit survived in their successors; and the triumph of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> avenged their recent defeat, and obliterated the disgrace of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> chapters.
 VIth general council:IIId of Constantinople, A.
D.
 680, Nov.
 7- 681, Sept.
 16.
 The synods of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were confirmed by the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> general council of Constantinople, in the palace and the presence of a new Constantine, a descendant of Heraclius.
 The royal convert converted the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> pontiff and a majority of the bishops; (105) the dissenters, with their chief, <PERSON>Macarius</PERSON> of Antioch, were condemned to the spiritual and temporal pains of heresy; the <LOC>East</LOC> condescended to accept the lessons of the West; and the creed was finally settled, which teaches the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> of every age, that <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> wills or energies are harmonized in the person of Christ.
 The majesty of the pope and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> synod was represented by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> priests, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> deacon, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> bishops; but these obscure <NORP>Latins</NORP> had neither arms to compel, nor treasures to bribe, nor language to persuade; and I am ignorant by what arts they could determine the lofty emperor of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> to abjure the catechism of his infancy, and to persecute the religion of his fathers.
 Perhaps the monks and people of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> (106) were favorable to the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> creed, which is indeed the least reasonable of the two: and the suspicion is countenanced by the unnatural moderation of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> clergy, who appear in this quarrel to be conscious of their weakness.
 While the synod debated, a fanatic proposed a more summary decision, by raising a dead man to life: the prelates assisted at the trial; but the acknowledged failure may serve to indicate, that the passions and prejudices of the multitude were not enlisted on the side of the Monothelites.
 In the next generation, when the son of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was deposed and slain by the disciple of Macarius, they tasted the feast of revenge and dominion: the image or monument of the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> council was defaced, and the original acts were committed to the flames.
 But in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> year, their patron was cast headlong from the throne, the bishops of the <LOC>East</LOC> were released from their occasional conformity, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> faith was more firmly replanted by the orthodox successors of Bardanes, and the fine problems of the incarnation were forgotten in the more popular and visible quarrel of the worship of images.
 (107) Union of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Latin</NORP> churches.
 Before the end of the seventh century, the creed of the incarnation, which had been defined at <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Constantinople, was uniformly preached in the remote islands of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Ireland; (108) the same ideas were entertained, or rather the same words were repeated, by all the <NORP>Christians</NORP> whose liturgy was performed in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> or the <NORP>Latin</NORP> tongue.
 Their numbers, and visible splendor, bestowed an imperfect claim to the appellation of Catholics: but in the East, they were marked with the less honorable name of Melchites, or Royalists; (109) of men, whose faith, instead of resting on the basis of Scripture, reason, or tradition, had been established, and was still maintained, by the arbitrary power of a temporal monarch.
 Their adversaries might allege the words of the fathers of Constantinople, who profess themselves the slaves of the king; and they might relate, with malicious joy, how the decrees of <PERSON>Chalcedon</PERSON> had been inspired and reformed by the emperor <PERSON>Marcian</PERSON> and his virgin bride.
 The prevailing faction will naturally inculcate the duty of submission, nor is it less natural that dissenters should feel and assert the principles of freedom.
 Under the rod of persecution, the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> and <WORK_OF_ART>Monophysites</WORK_OF_ART> degenerated into rebels and fugitives; and the most ancient and useful allies of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were taught to consider the emperor not as the chief, but as the enemy of the Christians.
 Language, the leading principle which unites or separates the tribes of mankind, soon discriminated the sectaries of the East, by a peculiar and perpetual badge, which abolished the means of intercourse Perpetual separation of the oriental sects.
 and the hope of reconciliation.
 The long dominion of the Greeks, their colonies, and, above all, their eloquence, had propagated a language doubtless the most perfect that has been contrived by the art of man.
 Yet the body of the people, both in <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Egypt, still persevered in the use of their national idioms; with this difference, however, that the <NORP>Coptic</NORP> was confined to the rude and illiterate peasants of the Nile, while the Syriac, (110) from the mountains of <GPE>Assyria</GPE> to the Red Sea, was adapted to the higher topics of poetry and argument.
 <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and <PERSON>Abyssinia</PERSON> were infected by the speech or learning of the Greeks; and their <NORP>Barbaric</NORP> tongues, which have been revived in the studies of modern Europe, were unintelligible to the inhabitants of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The <NORP>Syriac</NORP> and the Coptic, the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> and the Aethiopic, are consecrated in the service of their respective churches: and their theology is enriched by domestic versions (111) both of the <WORK_OF_ART>Scriptures</WORK_OF_ART> and of the most popular fathers.
 After a period of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty years, the spark of controversy, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> kindled by a sermon of Nestorius, still burns in the bosom of the East, and the hostile communions still maintain the faith and discipline of their founders.
 In the most abject state of ignorance, poverty, and servitude, the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> and <WORK_OF_ART>Monophysites</WORK_OF_ART> reject the spiritual supremacy of Rome, and cherish the toleration of their <NORP>Turkish</NORP> masters, which allows them to anathematize, on the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hand, St.
 <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> and the synod of Ephesus: on the other, Pope <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> and the council of Chalcedon.
 The weight which they cast into the downfall of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire demands our notice, and the reader may be amused with the various prospect of, I The Nestorians; II The Jacobites; (112) III The Maronites; IV The Armenians; V The Copts; and, VI The Abyssinians.
 To the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> former, the <NORP>Syriac</NORP> is common; but of the latter, each is discriminated by the use of a national idiom.
 Yet the modern natives of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and <PERSON>Abyssinia</PERSON> would be incapable of conversing with their ancestors; and the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Syria, who reject the religion, have adopted the language of the Arabians.
 The lapse of time has seconded the sacerdotal arts; and in the East, as well as in the West, the Deity is addressed in an obsolete tongue, unknown to the majority of the congregation.
 THE NESTORIANS I.
 Both in his native and his episcopal province, the heresy of the unfortunate <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> was speedily obliterated.
 The <NORP>Oriental</NORP> bishops, who at <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> had resisted to his face the arrogance of Cyril, were mollified by his tardy concessions.
 The same prelates, or their successors, subscribed, not without a murmur, the decrees of Chalcedon; the power of the <WORK_OF_ART>Monophysites</WORK_OF_ART> reconciled them with the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> in the conformity of passion, of interest, and, insensibly, of belief; and their last reluctant sigh was breathed in the defence of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> chapters.
 Their dissenting brethren, less moderate, or more sincere, were crushed by the penal laws; and, as early as the reign of Justinian, it became difficult to find a church of <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> within the limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 Beyond those limits they had discovered a new world, in which they might hope for liberty, and aspire to conquest.
 In Persia, notwithstanding the resistance of the Magi, <NORP>Christianity</NORP> had struck a deep root, and the nations of the <LOC>East</LOC> reposed under its salutary shade.
 The catholic, or primate, resided in the capital: in his synods, and in their dioceses, his metropolitans, bishops, and clergy, represented the pomp and order of a regular hierarchy: they rejoiced in the increase of proselytes, who were converted from the <NORP>Zendavesta</NORP> to the gospel, from the secular to the monastic life; and their zeal was stimulated by the presence of an artful and formidable enemy.
 The <NORP>Persian</NORP> church had been founded by the missionaries of Syria; and their language, discipline, and doctrine, were closely interwoven with its original frame.
 The catholics were elected and ordained by their own suffragans; but their filial dependence on the patriarchs of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> is attested by the canons of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> church.
 (113) In the <NORP>Persian</NORP> school of Edessa, (114) the rising generations of the faithful imbibed their theological idiom: they studied in the <NORP>Syriac</NORP> version the <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> volumes of <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> of Mopsuestia; and they revered the apostolic faith and holy martyrdom of his disciple Nestorius, whose person and language were equally unknown to the nations beyond the Tigris.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> indelible lesson of Ibas, bishop of Edessa, taught them to execrate the Egyptians, who, in the synod of Ephesus, had impiously confounded the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> natures of Christ.
 The flight of the masters and scholars, who were twice expelled from the <GPE>Athens</GPE> of Syria, dispersed a crowd of missionaries inflamed by the double zeal of religion and revenge.
 And the rigid unity of the Monophysites, who, under the reigns of <PERSON>Zeno</PERSON> and Anastasius, had invaded the thrones of the East, provoked their antagonists, in a land of freedom, to avow a moral, rather than a physical, union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> persons of Christ.
 Since the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> preaching of the gospel, the <NORP>Sassanian</NORP> kings beheld with an eye of suspicion a race of aliens and apostates, who had embraced the religion, and who might favor the cause, of the hereditary foes of their country.
 The royal edicts had often prohibited their dangerous correspondence with the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> clergy: the progress of the schism was grateful to the jealous pride of Perozes, and he listened to the eloquence of an artful prelate, who painted <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> as the friend of Persia, and urged him to secure the fidelity of his <NORP>Christian</NORP> subjects, by granting a just preference to the victims and enemies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tyrant.
 The <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> composed a large majority of the clergy and people: they were encouraged by the smile, and armed with the sword, of despotism; yet many of their weaker brethren were startled at the thought of breaking loose from the communion of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world, and the blood of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred Monophysites, or Catholics, confirmed the uniformity of faith and discipline in the churches of Persia.
 (115) sole masters of Persia, A.
D.
 500, etc Their ecclesiastical institutions are distinguished by a liberal principle of reason, or at least of policy: the austerity of the cloister was relaxed and gradually forgotten; houses of charity were endowed for the education of orphans and foundlings; the law of celibacy, so forcibly recommended to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, was disregarded by the <NORP>Persian</NORP> clergy; and the number of the elect was multiplied by the public and reiterated nuptials of the priests, the bishops, and even the patriarch himself.
 To this standard of natural and religious freedom, myriads of fugitives resorted from all the provinces of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire; the narrow bigotry of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was punished by the emigration of his most industrious subjects; they transported into <GPE>Persia</GPE> the arts both of peace and war: and those who deserved the favor, were promoted in the service, of a discerning monarch.
 The arms of Nushirvan, and his fiercer grandson, were assisted with advice, and money, and troops, by the desperate sectaries who still lurked in their native cities of the East: their zeal was rewarded with the gift of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> churches; but when those cities and churches were recovered by Heraclius, their open profession of treason and heresy compelled them to seek a refuge in the realm of their foreign ally.
 But the seeming tranquillity of the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> was often endangered, and sometimes overthrown.
 They were involved in the common evils of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> despotism: their enmity to <GPE>Rome</GPE> could not always atone for their attachment to the gospel: and a colony of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Jacobites, the captives of <GPE>Apamea</GPE> and Antioch, was permitted to erect a hostile altar in the face of the catholic, and in the sunshine of the court.
 In his last treaty, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> introduced some conditions which tended to enlarge and fortify the toleration of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> in Persia.
 The emperor, ignorant of the rights of conscience, was incapable of pity or esteem for the heretics who denied the authority of the holy synods: but he flattered himself that they would gradually perceive the temporal benefits of union with the empire and the church of Rome; and if he failed in exciting their gratitude, he might hope to provoke the jealousy of their sovereign.
 In a later age the <NORP>Lutherans</NORP> have been burnt at Paris, and protected in Germany, by the superstition and policy of the most <NORP>Christian</NORP> king.

 The desire of gaining souls for God and subjects for the church, has excited in every age the diligence of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> priests.
 From the conquest of <GPE>Persia</GPE> they carried their spiritual arms to the north, the east, and the south; and the simplicity of the gospel was fashioned and painted with the colors of the <NORP>Syriac</NORP> theology.
 In the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century, according to the report of a <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> traveller, (116) <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was successfully preached to the Bactrians, the Huns, the Persians, the Indians, the Persarmenians, the Medes, and the Elamites: the <NORP>Barbaric</NORP> churches, from the Gulf of <GPE>Persia</GPE> to the Caspian Sea, were almost infinite; and their recent faith was conspicuous in the number and sanctity of their monks and martyrs.
 The pepper coast of Malabar, and the isles of the ocean, <LOC>Socotora</LOC> and Ceylon, were peopled with an increasing multitude of Christians; and the bishops and clergy of those sequestered regions derived their ordination from the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> of Babylon.
 In a subsequent age the zeal of the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> overleaped the limits which had confined the ambition and curiosity both of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Persians.
 The missionaries of <PERSON>Balch</PERSON> and <GPE>Samarcand</GPE> pursued without fear the footsteps of the roving Tartar, and insinuated themselves into the camps of the valleys of <LOC>Imaus</LOC> and the banks of the Selinga.
 They exposed a metaphysical creed to those illiterate shepherds: to those sanguinary warriors, they recommended humanity and repose.
 Yet a khan, whose power they vainly magnified, is said to have received at their hands the rites of baptism, and even of ordination; and the fame of <PERSON>Prester</PERSON> or Presbyter <PERSON>John</PERSON> (117) has long amused the credulity of Europe.
 The royal convert was indulged in the use of a portable altar; but he despatched an embassy to the patriarch, to inquire how, in the season of Lent, he should abstain from animal food, and how he might celebrate the Eucharist in a desert that produced neither corn nor wine.
 In their progress by sea and land, the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> entered <GPE>China</GPE> by the port of <GPE>Canton</GPE> and the northern residence of Sigan.
 Unlike the senators of Rome, who assumed with a smile the characters of priests and augurs, the mandarins, who affect in public the reason of philosophers, are devoted in private to every mode of popular superstition.
 They cherished and they confounded the gods of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> and of India; but the propagation of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> awakened the jealousy of the state, and, after a short vicissitude of favor and persecution, the foreign sect expired in ignorance and oblivion.
 (118) Under the reign of the caliphs, the <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> church was diffused from <GPE>China</GPE> to <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> and Cyrus; and their numbers, with those of the Jacobites, were computed to surpass the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Latin</NORP> communions.
 (119) <CARDINAL>Twenty-five</CARDINAL> metropolitans or archbishops composed their hierarchy; but several of these were dispensed, by the distance and danger of the way, from the duty of personal attendance, on the easy condition that every <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years they should testify their faith and obedience to the catholic or patriarch of Babylon, a vague appellation which has been successively applied to the royal seats of Seleucia, Ctesiphon, and Bagdad.
 These remote branches are long since withered; and the old patriarchal trunk (120) is now divided by the <NORP>Elijahs</NORP> of Mosul, the representatives almost on lineal descent of the genuine and primitive succession; the <NORP>Josephs</NORP> of Amida, who are reconciled to the church of Rome: (121) and the <NORP>Simeons</NORP> of <PERSON>Van</PERSON> or Ormia, whose revolt, at the head of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> families, was promoted in the sixteenth century by the <NORP>Sophis</NORP> of Persia.
 The number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> is allowed for the whole body of the Nestorians, who, under the name of <NORP>Chaldeans</NORP> or Assyrians, are confounded with the most learned or the most powerful nation of <NORP>Eastern</NORP> antiquity.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> of St.
 Thomas in India, A.
D.
 883.
 According to the legend of antiquity, the gospel was preached in <GPE>India</GPE> by St.
 Thomas.
 (122) At the end of the ninth century, his shrine, perhaps in the neighborhood of Madras, was devoutly visited by the ambassadors of Alfred; and their return with a cargo of pearls and spices rewarded the zeal of the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> monarch, who entertained the largest projects of trade and discovery.
 (123) When the <NORP>Portuguese</NORP> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> opened the navigation of India, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of St.
 Thomas had been seated for ages on the coast of Malabar, and the difference of their character and color attested the mixture of a foreign race.
 In arms, in arts, and possibly in virtue, they excelled the natives of Hindostan; the husbandmen cultivated the palm-tree, the merchants were enriched by the pepper trade, the soldiers preceded the nairs or nobles of Malabar, and their hereditary privileges were respected by the gratitude or the fear of the king of <GPE>Cochin</GPE> and the <NORP>Zamorin</NORP> himself.
 They acknowledged a Gentoo of sovereign, but they were governed, even in temporal concerns, by the bishop of Angamala.
 He still asserted his ancient title of metropolitan of India, but his real jurisdiction was exercised in fourteen hundred churches, and he was intrusted with the care of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> souls.
 Their religion would have rendered them the firmest and most cordial allies of the Portuguese; but the inquisitors soon discerned in the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of St.
 Thomas the unpardonable guilt of heresy and schism.
 Instead of owning themselves the subjects of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, the spiritual and temporal monarch of the globe, they adhered, like their ancestors, to the communion of the <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> patriarch; and the bishops whom he ordained at Mosul, traversed the dangers of the sea and land to reach their diocese on the coast of Malabar.
 In their <NORP>Syriac</NORP> liturgy the names of <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> and <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> were piously commemorated: they united their adoration of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> persons of Christ; the title of Mother of God was offensive to their ear, and they measured with scrupulous avarice the honors of the <LOC>Virgin</LOC> Mary, whom the superstition of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> had almost exalted to the rank of a goddess.
 When her image was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> presented to the disciples of St.
 Thomas, they indignantly exclaimed, "We are Christians, not idolaters!" and their simple devotion was content with the veneration of the cross.
 Their separation from the <NORP>Western</NORP> world had left them in ignorance of the improvements, or corruptions, of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years; and their conformity with the faith and practice of the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> century would equally disappoint the prejudices of a <NORP>Papist</NORP> or a Protestant.
 It was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> care of the ministers of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to intercept all correspondence with the <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> patriarch, and several of his bishops expired in the prisons of the holy office.
 The flock, without a shepherd, was assaulted by the power of the Portuguese, the arts of the Jesuits, and the zeal of Alexis de Menezes, archbishop of Goa, in his personal visitation of the coast of Malabar.
 The synod of Diamper, at which he presided, consummated the pious work of the reunion; and rigorously imposed the doctrine and discipline of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, without forgetting auricular confession, the strongest engine of ecclesiastical torture.
 The memory of <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> and <NORP>Nestorius</NORP> was condemned, and <GPE>Malabar</GPE> was reduced under the dominion of the pope, of the primate, and of the <NORP>Jesuits</NORP> who invaded the see of <PERSON>Angamala</PERSON> or Cranganor.
 A.
D.
 1599-1663.
Sixty years of servitude and hypocrisy were patiently endured; but as soon as the <NORP>Portuguese</NORP> empire was shaken by the courage and industry of the Dutch, the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> asserted, with vigor and effect, the religion of their fathers.
 The <NORP>Jesuits</NORP> were incapable of defending the power which they had abused; the arms of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christians</NORP> were pointed against their falling tyrants; and the <NORP>Indian</NORP> archdeacon assumed the character of bishop till a fresh supply of episcopal gifts and <NORP>Syriac</NORP> missionaries could be obtained from the patriarch of Babylon.
 Since the expulsion of the Portuguese, the <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> creed is freely professed on the coast of Malabar.
 The trading companies of <GPE>Holland</GPE> and <GPE>England</GPE> are the friends of toleration; but if oppression be less mortifying than contempt, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of St.
 Thomas have reason to complain of the cold and silent indifference of their brethren of Europe.
 (124) THE JACOBITES II.
 The history of the <WORK_OF_ART>Monophysites</WORK_OF_ART> is less copious and interesting than that of the Nestorians.
 Under the reigns of <PERSON>Zeno</PERSON> and Anastasius, their artful leaders surprised the ear of the prince, usurped the thrones of the East, and crushed on its native soil the school of the Syrians.
 The rule of the <NORP>Monophysite</NORP> faith was defined with exquisite discretion by Severus, patriarch of Antioch: he condemned, in the style of the Henoticon, the adverse heresies of Nestorius; and <ORG>Eutyches</ORG> maintained against the latter the reality of the body of Christ, and constrained the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> to allow that he was a liar who spoke truth.
 (125) But the approximation of ideas could not abate the vehemence of passion; each party was the more astonished that their blind antagonist could dispute on so trifling a difference; the tyrant of <GPE>Syria</GPE> enforced the belief of his creed, and his reign was polluted with the blood of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> monks, who were slain, not perhaps without provocation or resistance, under the walls of Apamea.
 (126) The successor of AnastasiusA.
D.
 518.
 replanted the orthodox standard in the East; <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> fled into Egypt; and his friend, the eloquent Xenaias, (127) who had escaped from the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> of Persia, was suffocated in his exile by the <PERSON>Melchites</PERSON> of Paphlagonia.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty-four</CARDINAL> bishops were swept from their thrones, <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> hundred ecclesiastics were cast into prison, (128) and notwithstanding the ambiguous favor of Theodora, the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> flocks, deprived of their shepherds, must insensibly have been either famished or poisoned.
 In this spiritual distress, the expiring faction was revived, and united, and perpetuated, by the labors of a monk; and the name of James Baradaeus (129) has been preserved in the appellation of Jacobites, a familiar sound, which may startle the ear of an <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> reader.
 From the holy confessors in their prison of Constantinople, he received the powers of bishop of <PERSON>Edessa</PERSON> and apostle of the East, and the ordination of fourscore <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> bishops, priests, and deacons, is derived from the same inexhaustible source.
 The speed of the zealous missionary was promoted by the fleetest dromedaries of a devout chief of the Arabs; the doctrine and discipline of the <PERSON>Jacobites</PERSON> were secretly established in the dominions of Justinian; and each <NORP>Jacobite</NORP> was compelled to violate the laws and to hate the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legislator.
 The successors of Severus, while they lurked in convents or villages, while they sheltered their proscribed heads in the caverns of hermits, or the tents of the Saracens, still asserted, as they now assert, their indefeasible right to the title, the rank, and the prerogatives of patriarch of Antioch: under the milder yoke of the infidels, they reside about a league from Merdin, in the pleasant monastery of Zapharan, which they have embellished with cells, aqueducts, and plantations.
 The secondary, though honorable, place is filled by the maphrian, who, in his station at <GPE>Mosul</GPE> itself, defies the <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> catholic with whom he contests the primacy of the East.
 Under the patriarch and the maphrian, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> archbishops and bishops have been counted in the different ages of the <NORP>Jacobite</NORP> church; but the order of the hierarchy is relaxed or dissolved, and the greater part of their dioceses is confined to the neighborhood of the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> and the Tigris.
 The cities of <GPE>Aleppo</GPE> and Amida, which are often visited by the patriarch, contain some wealthy merchants and industrious mechanics, but the multitude derive their scanty sustenance from their daily labor: and poverty, as well as superstition, may impose their excessive fasts: <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> annual lents, during which both the clergy and laity abstain not only from flesh or eggs, but even from the taste of wine, of oil, and of fish.
 Their present numbers are esteemed from <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> to fourscore <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> souls, the remnant of a populous church, which was gradually decreased under the impression of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> centuries.
 Yet in that long period, some strangers of merit have been converted to the <NORP>Monophysite</NORP> faith, and a <NORP>Jew</NORP> was the father of Abulpharagius, (130) primate of the East, so truly eminent both in his life and death.
 In his life he was an elegant writer of the <NORP>Syriac</NORP> and <NORP>Arabic</NORP> tongues, a poet, physician, and historian, a subtile philosopher, and a moderate divine.
 In his death, his funeral was attended by his rival the <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> patriarch, with a train of <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Armenians, who forgot their disputes, and mingled their tears over the grave of an enemy.
 The sect which was honored by the virtues of <PERSON>Abulpharagius</PERSON> appears, however, to sink below the level of their <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> brethren.
 The superstition of the <PERSON>Jacobites</PERSON> is more abject, their fasts more rigid, (131) their intestine divisions are more numerous, and their doctors (as far as I can measure the degrees of nonsense) are more remote from the precincts of reason.
 Something may possibly be allowed for the rigor of the <NORP>Monophysite</NORP> theology; much more for the superior influence of the monastic order.
 In Syria, in Egypt, in Ethiopia, the <NORP>Jacobite</NORP> monks have ever been distinguished by the austerity of their penance and the absurdity of their legends.
 Alive or dead, they are worshipped as the favorites of the Deity; the crosier of bishop and patriarch is reserved for their venerable hands; and they assume the government of men, while they are yet reeking with the habits and prejudices of the cloister.
 (132) THE MARONITES III.
 In the style of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> Christians, the <NORP>Monothelites</NORP> of every age are described under the appellation of Maronites, (133) a name which has been insensibly transferred from a hermit to a monastery, from a monastery to a nation.
 Maron, a saint or savage of the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> century, displayed his religious madness in Syria; the rival cities of <GPE>Apamea</GPE> and <PERSON>Emesa</PERSON> disputed his relics, a stately church was erected on his tomb, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred of his disciples united their solitary cells on the banks of the Orontes.
 In the controversies of the incarnation they nicely threaded the orthodox line between the sects of <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> and Eutyches; but the unfortunate question of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> will or operation in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> natures of Christ, was generated by their curious leisure.
 Their proselyte, the emperor Heraclius, was rejected as a <NORP>Maronite</NORP> from the walls of Emesa, he found a refuge in the monastery of his brethren; and their theological lessons were repaid with the gift a spacious and wealthy domain.
 The name and doctrine of this venerable school were propagated among the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Syrians, and their zeal is expressed by Macarius, patriarch of Antioch, who declared before the synod of Constantinople, that sooner than subscribe the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> wills of Christ, he would submit to be hewn piecemeal and cast into the sea.
 (134) A similar or a less cruel mode of persecution soon converted the unresisting subjects of the plain, while the glorious title of Mardaites, (135) or rebels, was bravely maintained by the hardy natives of Mount Libanus.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> Maron, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most learned and popular of the monks, assumed the character of patriarch of Antioch; his nephew, Abraham, at the head of the Maronites, defended their civil and religious freedom against the tyrants of the East.
 The son of the orthodox <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> pursued with pious hatred a people of soldiers, who might have stood the bulwark of his empire against the common foes of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and of Rome.
 An army of <NORP>Greeks</NORP> invaded Syria; the monastery of St.
 <PERSON>Maron</PERSON> was destroyed with fire; the bravest chieftains were betrayed and murdered, and <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of their followers were transplanted to the distant frontiers of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and Thrace.
 Yet the humble nation of the <PERSON>Maronites</PERSON> had survived the empire of Constantinople, and they still enjoy, under their <NORP>Turkish</NORP> masters, a free religion and a mitigated servitude.
 Their domestic governors are chosen among the ancient nobility: the patriarch, in his monastery of Canobin, still fancies himself on the throne of Antioch: <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> bishops compose his synod, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> priests, who retain the liberty of marriage, are intrusted with the care of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> souls.
 Their country extends from the ridge of Mount Libanus to the shores of Tripoli; and the gradual descent affords, in a narrow space, each variety of soil and climate, from the Holy Cedars, erect under the weight of snow, (136) to the vine, the mulberry, and the olive-trees of the fruitful valley.
 In the twelfth century, the Maronites, abjuring the <NORP>Monothelite</NORP> error were reconciled to the <NORP>Latin</NORP> churches of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> and Rome, (137) and the same alliance has been frequently renewed by the ambition of the popes and the distress of the Syrians.
 But it may reasonably be questioned, whether their union has ever been perfect or sincere; and the learned <PERSON>Maronites</PERSON> of the college of <GPE>Rome</GPE> have vainly labored to absolve their ancestors from the guilt of heresy and schism.
 (138) THE ARMENIANS IV.
 Since the age of Constantine, the ARMENIANS (139) had signalized their attachment to the religion and empire of the Christians.
 The disorders of their country, and their ignorance of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> tongue, prevented their clergy from assisting at the synod of Chalcedon, and they floated eighty-four years (140) in a state of indifference or suspense, till their vacant faith was finally occupied by the missionaries of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> of Halicarnassus, (141) who in Egypt, their common exile, had been vanquished by the arguments or the influence of his rival Severus, the <NORP>Monophysite</NORP> patriarch of Antioch.
 The <NORP>Armenians</NORP> alone are the pure disciples of Eutyches, an unfortunate parent, who has been renounced by the greater part of his spiritual progeny.
 They alone persevere in the opinion, that the manhood of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was created, or existed without creation, of a divine and incorruptible substance.
 Their adversaries reproach them with the adoration of a phantom; and they retort the accusation, by deriding or execrating the blasphemy of the Jacobites, who impute to the <PERSON>Godhead</PERSON> the vile infirmities of the flesh, even the natural effects of nutrition and digestion.
 The religion of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> could not derive much glory from the learning or the power of its inhabitants.
 The royalty expired with the origin of their schism; and their <NORP>Christian</NORP> kings, who arose and fell in the thirteenth century on the confines of Cilicia, were the clients of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> and the vassals of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan of Iconium.
 The helpless nation has seldom been permitted to enjoy the tranquillity of servitude.
 From the earliest period to the present hour, <GPE>Armenia</GPE> has been the theatre of perpetual war: the lands between <GPE>Tauris</GPE> and <GPE>Erivan</GPE> were dispeopled by the cruel policy of the Sophis; and myriads of <NORP>Christian</NORP> families were transplanted, to perish or to propagate in the distant provinces of Persia.
 Under the rod of oppression, the zeal of the <NORP>Armenians</NORP> is fervent and intrepid; they have often preferred the crown of martyrdom to the white turban of Mahomet; they devoutly hate the error and idolatry of the Greeks; and their transient union with the <NORP>Latins</NORP> is not less devoid of truth, than the <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> bishops, whom their patriarch offered at the feet of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 (142) The catholic, or patriarch, of the <NORP>Armenians</NORP> resides in the monastery of Ekmiasin, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> leagues from Erivan.
 <CARDINAL>Forty-seven</CARDINAL> archbishops, each of whom may claim the obedience of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> suffragans, are consecrated by his hand; but the far greater part are only titular prelates, who dignify with their presence and service the simplicity of his court.
 As soon as they have performed the liturgy, they cultivate the garden; and our bishops will hear with surprise, that the austerity of their life increases in just proportion to the elevation of their rank.
 In the fourscore <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> towns or villages of his spiritual empire, the patriarch receives a small and voluntary tax from each person above the age of fifteen; but the annual amount of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> crowns is insufficient to supply the incessant demands of charity and tribute.
 Since the beginning of the last century, the <NORP>Armenians</NORP> have obtained a large and lucrative share of the commerce of the East: in their return from Europe, the caravan usually halts in the neighborhood of Erivan, the altars are enriched with the fruits of their patient industry; and the faith of <ORG>Eutyches</ORG> is preached in their recent congregations of <GPE>Barbary</GPE> and Poland.
 (143) THE COPTS V.
 In the rest of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, the despotism of the prince might eradicate or silence the sectaries of an obnoxious creed.
 But the stubborn temper of the <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> maintained their opposition to the synod of Chalcedon, and the policy of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> condescended to expect and to seize the opportunity of discord.
 The <NORP>Monophysite</NORP> church of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> (144) was torn by the disputes of the corruptibles and incorruptibles, and on the death of the patriarch, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions upheld their respective candidates.
 (145) Gaian was the disciple of Julian, The patriarch Theodosius, A.
D.
 537-568.
 <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> had been the pupil of Severus: the claims of the former were supported by the consent of the monks and senators, the city and the province; the latter depended on the priority of his ordination, the favor of the empress Theodora, and the arms of the eunuch Narses, which might have been used in more honorable warfare.
 The exile of the popular candidate to <GPE>Carthage</GPE> and <GPE>Sardinia</GPE> inflamed the ferment of Alexandria; and after a schism of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and seventy years, the <PERSON>Gaianites</PERSON> still revered the memory and doctrine of their founder.
 The strength of numbers and of discipline was tried in a desperate and bloody conflict; the streets were filled with the dead bodies of citizens and soldiers; the pious women, ascending the roofs of their houses, showered down every sharp or ponderous utensil on the heads of the enemy; and the final victory of <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> was owing to the flames, with which he wasted the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> capital of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 But the lieutenant of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> had not conquered in the cause of a heretic; <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> himself was speedily, though gently, removed; and A.
D.
 538 <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> of Tanis, an orthodox monk, was raised to the throne of Athanasius.
 The powers of government were strained in his support; he might appoint or displace the dukes and tribunes of Egypt; the allowance of bread, which <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> had granted, was suppressed, the churches were shut, and a nation of schismatics was deprived at once of their spiritual and carnal food.
 In his turn, the tyrant was excommunicated by the zeal and revenge of the people: and none except his servile <PERSON>Melchites</PERSON> would salute him as a man, a Christian, or a bishop.
 Yet such is the blindness of ambition, that, when <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> was expelled on a charge of murder, he solicited, with a bribe of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred pounds of gold, his restoration to the same station of hatred and ignominy.
 His successor A.
D.
 551.
 <PERSON>Apollinaris</PERSON> entered the hostile city in military array, alike qualified for prayer or for battle.
 His troops, under arms, were distributed through the streets; the gates of the cathedral were guarded, and a chosen band was stationed in the choir, to defend the person of their chief.
 He stood erect on his throne, and, throwing aside the upper garment of a warrior, suddenly appeared before the eyes of the multitude in the robes of patriarch of Alexandria.
 Astonishment held them mute; but no sooner had <PERSON>Apollinaris</PERSON> begun to read the tome of St.
 Leo, than a volley of curses, and invectives, and stones, assaulted the odious minister of the emperor and the synod.
 A charge was instantly sounded by the successor of the apostles; the soldiers waded to their knees in blood; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christians</NORP> are said to have fallen by the sword: an incredible account, even if it be extended from the slaughter of a day to the <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> years of the reign of Apollinaris.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> succeeding patriarchs, <PERSON>Eulogius</PERSON> (146) and John, (147) labored in the conversion of heretics, with arms and arguments more worthy of their evangelical profession.
 The theological knowledge of A.
D.
 580 <PERSON>Eulogius</PERSON> was displayed in many a volume, which magnified the errors of <ORG>Eutyches</ORG> and Severus, and attempted to reconcile the ambiguous language of St.
 <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> with the orthodox creed of Pope <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> and the fathers of Chalcedon.
 The bounteous alms of A.
D.
 609 <PERSON>John</PERSON> the eleemosynary were dictated by superstition, or benevolence, or policy.
 <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred poor were maintained at his expense; on his accession he found <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold in the treasury of the church; he collected <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> from the liberality of the faithful; yet the primate could boast in his testament, that he left behind him no more than the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> part of the smallest of the silver coins.
 The churches of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> were delivered to the Catholics, the religion of the <WORK_OF_ART>Monophysites</WORK_OF_ART> was proscribed in Egypt, and a law was revived which excluded the natives from the honors and emoluments of the state.
 Their separation and decay.
 A more important conquest still remained, of the patriarch, the oracle and leader of the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> church.
 <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> had resisted the threats and promises of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> with the spirit of an apostle or an enthusiast.
 After comforting his brethren, he embarked for Constantinople, and sustained, in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> successive interviews, the almost irresistible weight of the royal presence.
 His opinions were favorably entertained in the palace and the city; the influence of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> assured him a safe conduct and honorable dismission; and he ended his days, though not on the throne, yet in the bosom, of his native country.
 On the news of his death, <PERSON>Apollinaris</PERSON> indecently feasted the nobles and the clergy; but his joy was checked by the intelligence of a new election; and while he enjoyed the wealth of Alexandria, his rivals reigned in the monasteries of Thebais, and were maintained by the voluntary oblations of the people.
 A perpetual succession of patriarchs arose from the ashes of Theodosius; and the <NORP>Monophysite</NORP> churches of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and <GPE>Egypt</GPE> were united by the name of <PERSON>Jacobites</PERSON> and the communion of the faith.
 But the same faith, which has been confined to a narrow sect of the Syrians, was diffused over the mass of the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> or <NORP>Coptic</NORP> nation; who, almost unanimously, rejected the decrees of the synod of Chalcedon.
 A <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years were now elapsed since <GPE>Egypt</GPE> had ceased to be a kingdom, since the conquerors of <LOC>Asia</LOC> and <LOC>Europe</LOC> had trampled on the ready necks of a people, whose ancient wisdom and power ascend beyond the records of history.
 The conflict of zeal and persecution rekindled some sparks of their national spirit.
 They abjured, with a foreign heresy, the manners and language of the Greeks: every Melchite, in their eyes, was a stranger, every <NORP>Jacobite</NORP> a citizen; the alliance of marriage, the offices of humanity, were condemned as a deadly sin the natives renounced all allegiance to the emperor; and his orders, at a distance from Alexandria, were obeyed only under the pressure of military force.
 A generous effort might have edeemed the religion and liberty of Egypt, and her <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred monasteries might have poured forth their myriads of holy warriors, for whom death should have no terrors, since life had no comfort or delight.
 But experience has proved the distinction of active and passive courage; the fanatic who endures without a groan the torture of the rack or the stake, would tremble and fly before the face of an armed enemy.
 The pusillanimous temper of the <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> could only hope for a change of masters; the arms of <NORP>Chosroes</NORP> depopulated the land, yet under his reign the <PERSON>Jacobites</PERSON> enjoyed a short and precarious respite.
 The victory of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> renewed and aggravated the persecution, and the patriarch again escaped from <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> to the desert.
 Benjamin, the <NORP>Jacobite</NORP> patriarch, A.
D.
 625-661.
 In his flight, <PERSON>Benjamin</PERSON> was encouraged by a voice, which bade him expect, at the end of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years, the aid of a foreign nation, marked, like the <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> themselves, with the ancient rite of circumcision.
 The character of these deliverers, and the nature of the deliverance, will be hereafter explained; and I shall step over the interval of eleven centuries to observe the present misery of the <PERSON>Jacobites</PERSON> of Egypt.
 The populous city of <GPE>Cairo</GPE> affords a residence, or rather a shelter, for their indigent patriarch, and a remnant of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> bishops; <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> monasteries have survived the inroads of the Arabs; and the progress of servitude and apostasy has reduced the <NORP>Coptic</NORP> nation to the despicable number of twenty-five or thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> families; (148) a race of illiterate beggars, whose only consolation is derived from the superior wretchedness of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> patriarch and his diminutive congregation.
 (149) THE ABYSSINIANS AND NUBIANS.
 VI.
 The <NORP>Coptic</NORP> patriarch, a rebel to the Caesars, or a slave to the khalifs, still gloried in the filial obedience of the kings of <GPE>Nubia</GPE> and Aethiopia.
 He repaid their homage by magnifying their greatness; and it was boldly asserted that they could bring into the field a hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse, with an equal number of camels; (150) that their hand could pour out or restrain the waters of the Nile; (151) and the peace and plenty of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> was obtained, even in this world, by the intercession of the patriarch.
 In exile at Constantinople, <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> recommended to his patroness the conversion of the black nations of Nubia, from the tropic of <LOC>Cancer</LOC> to the confines of Abyssinia.
 (152) Her design was suspected and emulated by the more orthodox emperor.
 The rival missionaries, a <NORP>Melchite</NORP> and a Jacobite, embarked at the same time; but the empress, from a motive of love or fear, was more effectually obeyed; and the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> priest was detained by the president of Thebais, while the king of <GPE>Nubia</GPE> and his court were hastily baptized in the faith of Dioscorus.
 The tardy envoy of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was received and dismissed with honor: but when he accused the heresy and treason of the Egyptians, the negro convert was instructed to reply that he would never abandon his brethren, the true believers, to the persecuting ministers of the synod of Chalcedon.
 (153) During several ages, the bishops of <GPE>Nubia</GPE> were named and consecrated by the <NORP>Jacobite</NORP> patriarch of Alexandria: as late as the twelfth century, <NORP>Christianity</NORP> prevailed; and some rites, some ruins, are still visible in the savage towns of <GPE>Sennaar</GPE> and Dongola.
 (154) But the <NORP>Nubians</NORP> at length executed their threats of returning to the worship of idols; the climate required the indulgence of polygamy, and they have finally preferred the triumph of the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> to the abasement of the Cross.
 A metaphysical religion may appear too refined for the capacity of the negro race: yet a black or a parrot might be taught to repeat the words of the <NORP>Chalcedonian</NORP> or <NORP>Monophysite</NORP> creed.
 The church of Abyssinia, A.
D.
 530, etc.
 <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was more deeply rooted in the <NORP>Abyssinian</NORP> empire; and, although the correspondence has been sometimes interrupted above seventy or a hundred years, the mother-church of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> retains her colony in a state of perpetual pupilage.
 <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> bishops once composed the <NORP>Aethiopic</NORP> synod: had their number amounted to ten, they might have elected an independent primate; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their kings was ambitious of promoting his brother to the ecclesiastical throne.
 But the event was foreseen, the increase was denied: the episcopal office has been gradually confined to the abuna, (155) the head and author of the <NORP>Abyssinian</NORP> priesthood; the patriarch supplies each vacancy with an <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> monk; and the character of a stranger appears more venerable in the eyes of the people, less dangerous in those of the monarch.
 In the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century, when the schism of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> was confirmed, the rival chiefs, with their patrons, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and Theodora, strove to outstrip each other in the conquest of a remote and independent province.
 The industry of the empress was again victorious, and the pious <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> has established in that sequestered church the faith and discipline of the Jacobites.
 (156) Encompassed on all sides by the enemies of their religion, the <NORP>Aethiopians</NORP> slept near a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years, forgetful of the world, by whom they were forgotten.
 The <NORP>Portugese</NORP> in Abyssinia, A.
D.
 1525-1550,etc.
 They were awakened by the Portuguese, who, turning the southern promontory of Africa, appeared in <GPE>India</GPE> and the Red Sea, as if they had descended through the air from a distant planet.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> moments of their interview, the subjects of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> observed the resemblance, rather than the difference, of their faith; and each nation expected the most important benefits from an alliance with their <NORP>Christian</NORP> brethren.
 In their lonely situation, the <NORP>Aethiopians</NORP> had almost relapsed into the savage life.
 Their vessels, which had traded to Ceylon, scarcely presumed to navigate the rivers of Africa; the ruins of <GPE>Axume</GPE> were deserted, the nation was scattered in villages, and the emperor, a pompous name, was content, both in peace and war, with the immovable residence of a camp.
 Conscious of their own indigence, the <NORP>Abyssinians</NORP> had formed the rational project of importing the arts and ingenuity of Europe; (157) and their ambassadors at <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Lisbon</GPE> were instructed to solicit a colony of smiths, carpenters, tilers, masons, printers, surgeons, and physicians, for the use of their country.
 But the public danger soon called for the instant and effectual aid of arms and soldiers, to defend an unwarlike people from the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> who ravaged the inland country and the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and <NORP>Arabs</NORP> who advanced from the sea-coast in more formidable array.
 <GPE>Aethiopia</GPE> was saved by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> Portuguese, who displayed in the field the native valor of Europeans, and the artificial power of the musket and cannon.
 In a moment of terror, the emperor had promised to reconcile himself and his subjects to the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> faith; a <NORP>Latin</NORP> patriarch represented the supremacy of the pope: (158) the empire, enlarged in a tenfold proportion, was supposed to contain more gold than the mines of America; and the wildest hopes of avarice and zeal were built on the willing submission of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of Africa.
 Mission of the Jesuits, A.
D.
 1557.
 But the vows which pain had extorted were forsworn on the return of health.
 The <NORP>Abyssinians</NORP> still adhered with unshaken constancy to the <NORP>Monophysite</NORP> faith; their languid belief was inflamed by the exercise of dispute; they branded the <NORP>Latins</NORP> with the names of <NORP>Arians</NORP> and Nestorians, and imputed the adoration of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> gods to those who separated the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> natures of Christ.
 Fremona, a place of worship, or rather of exile, was assigned to the <NORP>Jesuit</NORP> missionaries.
 Their skill in the liberal and mechanic arts, their theological learning, and the decency of their manners, inspired a barren esteem; but they were not endowed with the gift of miracles, (159) and they vainly solicited a reenforcement of <NORP>European</NORP> troops.
 The patience and dexterity of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> years at length obtained a more favorable audience, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors of <PERSON>Abyssinia</PERSON> were persuaded that <GPE>Rome</GPE> could insure the temporal and everlasting happiness of her votaries.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these royal converts lost his crown and his life; and the rebel army was sanctified by the abuna, who hurled an anathema at the apostate, and absolved his subjects from their oath of fidelity.
 The fate of <PERSON>Zadenghel</PERSON> was revenged by the courage and fortune of Susneus, who ascended the throne under the name of Segued, and more vigorously prosecuted the pious enterprise of his kinsman.
 After the amusement of some unequal combats between the <NORP>Jesuits</NORP> and his illiterate priests, the emperor declared himself a proselyte to the synod of Chalcedon, presuming that his clergy and people would embrace without delay the religion of their prince.
 The liberty of choice was succeeded by a law, which imposed, under pain of death, the belief of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> natures of Christ: the <NORP>Abyssinians</NORP> were enjoined to work and to play on the Sabbath; and Segued, in the face of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Africa, renounced his connection with the <NORP>Alexandrian</NORP> church.
 Conversion of the emperor, A.
D.
 1626.
 A Jesuit, Alphonso Mendez, the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> patriarch of Aethiopia, accepted, in the name of Urban VIII.
, the homage and abjuration of the penitent.
 A similar oath was repeated by his son, his brother, the clergy, the nobles, and even the ladies of the court: the <NORP>Latin</NORP> patriarch was invested with honors and wealth; and his missionaries erected their churches or citadels in the most convenient stations of the empire.
 The <NORP>Jesuits</NORP> themselves deplore the fatal indiscretion of their chief, who forgot the mildness of the gospel and the policy of his order, to introduce with hasty violence the liturgy of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the inquisition of Portugal.
 He condemned the ancient practice of circumcision, which health, rather than superstition, had <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invented in the climate of Aethiopia.
 (160) A new baptism, a new ordination, was inflicted on the natives; and they trembled with horror when the most holy of the dead were torn from their graves, when the most illustrious of the living were excommunicated by a foreign priest.
 In the defense of their religion and liberty, the <NORP>Abyssinians</NORP> rose in arms, with desperate but unsuccessful zeal.
 <CARDINAL>Five</CARDINAL> rebellions were extinguished in the blood of the insurgents: <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> abunas were slain in battle, whole legions were slaughtered in the field, or suffocated in their caverns; and neither merit, nor rank, nor sex, could save from an ignominious death the enemies of Rome.
 But the victorious monarch was finally subdued by the constancy of the nation, of his mother, of his son, and of his most faithful friends.
 <PERSON>Segued</PERSON> listened to the voice of pity, of reason, perhaps of fear: and his edict of liberty of conscience instantly revealed the tyranny and weakness of the Jesuits.
 On the death of his father, <PERSON>Basilides</PERSON> expelled the <NORP>Latin</NORP> patriarch, and restored to the wishes of the nation the faith and the discipline of Egypt.
 Final expulsion of the Jesuits, A.
D.
 1632, etc.
 The <NORP>Monophysite</NORP> churches resounded with a song of triumph, "that the sheep of <GPE>Aethiopia</GPE> were now delivered from the hyaenas of the West;" and the gates of that solitary realm were forever shut against the arts, the science, and the fanaticism of Europe.
 (161)
