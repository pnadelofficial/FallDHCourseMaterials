The emperors Decius, Gallus, Aemilianus,Valerian and GallienusThe nature of the subject FROM the great secular games celebrated by <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> to the death of the emperor <PERSON>Gallienus</PERSON> there elapsed (A.
D, 248-268) twenty years of shame and misfortune.
 During that calamitous period every instant of time was marked, every province of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world was afflicted by barbarous invaders and military tyrants, and the ruined empire seemed to approach the last and fatal moment of its dissolution.
 The confusion of the times, and the scarcity of authentic memorials, oppose equal difficulties to the historian, who attempts to preserve a clear and unbroken thread of narration.
 Surrounded with imperfect fragments, always concise, often obscure, and sometimes contradictory, he is reduced to collect, to compare, and to conjecture: and though he ought never to place his conjectures in the rank of facts, yet the knowledge of human nature, and of the sure operation of its fierce and unrestrained passions, might, on some occasions, supply the want of historical materials.
 The emperor <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> There is not, for instance, any difficulty in conceiving that the successive murders of so many emperors had loosened all the ties of allegiance between the prince and people; that all the generals of <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> were disposed to imitate the example of their master; and that the caprice of armies, long since habituated to frequent and violent revolutions, might any day raise to the throne the most obscure of their fellow-soldiers.
 History can only add that the rebellion against the emperor <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> broke out in the summer of the year <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-nine, among the legions of Maesi; and that a subaltern officer, (1) named Marinus, was the object of their seditious choice.
 <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> was alarmed.
 He dreaded lest the treason of the <NORP>Maesian</NORP> army should prove the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> spark of a general conflagration.
 Services, revolt, victory, and reign of the emperor Distracted with the consciousness of his guilt and of his danger, he communicated the intelligence to the senate.
 A gloomy silence prevailed, the effect of fear, and perhaps of disaffection: till at length Decius, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the assembly, assuming a spirit worthy of his noble extraction (2), ventured to discover more intrepidity than the emperor seemed to possess.
 He treated the whole business with contempt, as a hasty and inconsiderate tumult, and Philip's rival as a phantom of royalty, who in a very few days would be destroyed by the same inconstancy that had created him.
 The speedy completion of the prophecy inspired <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> with a just esteem for so able a counsellor: and <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> appeared to him the only person capable of restoring peace and discipline to an army whose tumultuous spirit did not immediately subside after the murder of Marinus.
 <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> who long resisted his own nomination, seems to have insinuated the danger of presenting a leader of merit to the angry and apprehensive minds of the soldiers; and his prediction was again confirmed by the event.
 The legion of <PERSON>Maesia</PERSON> forced their judge to become (A.
D.
 249) their accomplice.
 They left him only the alternative of death or the purple.
 His subsequent conduct, after that decisive measure, was unavoidable.
 He conducted or followed his army to the confines of Italy, whither Philip, collecting all his force to repel the formidable competitor whom he had raised up, advanced to meet him.
 The <ORG>Imperial</ORG> troops were superior in number; but the rebels formed an army of veterans, commanded by an able and experienced leader.
 <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> was either killed in the battle or put to death a few days afterwards at Verona.
 His son and associate in the empire was massacred at <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the <PERSON>Praetorian</PERSON> guards; and the victorious Decius, with more favourable circumstances than the ambition of that age can usually plead, was universally acknowledged by the senate and provinces.
 It is reported that, immediately after his reluctant acceptance of the title of Augustus, he had assured Philip, by a private message, of his innocence and loyalty, solemnly protesting that, on his arrival in Italy, he would resign the imperial ornaments and return to the condition of an obedient subject.
 His professions might be sincere.
 But in the situation where fortune had placed him it was scarcely possible that he could either forgive or be forgiven.
 (3) He marches against the <NORP>Goths</NORP> The emperor <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> had employed a few months in the works of peace and the administration of justice, when (A.
D.
 250) he was summoned to the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> by the invasion of the GOTHS.
 This is the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> considerable occasion in which history mentions that great people, who afterwards broke the <NORP>Roman</NORP> power, sacked the Capitol, and reigned in Gaul, Spain, and Italy.
 So memorable was the part which they acted in the subversion of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire that the name of <ORG>GOTHS</ORG> is frequently but improperly used as a general appellation of rude and war-like barbarism.
 Origin of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> from <LOC>Scandinavia</LOC> In the beginning of the sixth century, and after the conquest of Italy, the Goths, in possession of present greatness, very naturally indulged themselves in the prospect of past and of future glory.
 They wished to preserve the memory of their ancestors, and to transmit to posterity their own achievements.
 The principal minister of the court of Ravenna, the learned Cassiodorus, gratified the inclination of the conquerors in a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> history, which consisted of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> books, now reduced to the imperfect abridgment of Jornandes.
 (4) These writers passed with the most artful conciseness over the misfortunes of the nation, celebrated its successful valour, and adorned the triumph with many <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> trophies that more properly belonged to the people of Scythia.
 On the faith of ancient songs, the uncertain, but the only, memorials of barbarians, they deduced the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> origin of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> from the vast island, or peninsula, of Scandinavia.
 (5) That extreme country of the north was not unknown to the conquerors of Italy: the ties of ancient consanguinity had been strengthened by recent offices of friendship; and a <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> king had cheerfully abdicated his savage greatness that he might pass the remainder of his days in the peaceful and polished court of Ravenna.
 (6) Many vestiges, which cannot be ascribed to the arts of popular vanity, attest the ancient residence of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in the countries beyond the Baltic.
 From the time of the geographer Ptolemy, the southern part of <GPE>Sweden</GPE> seems to have continued in the possession of the less enterprising remnant of the nation, and a large territory is even at present divided into east and west Gothland.
 During the middle ages (from the ninth to the twelfth century), whilst <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was advancing with a slow progress into the north, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the <NORP>Swedes</NORP> composed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> distinct and sometimes hostile members of the same monarchy.
 (7) The latter of these <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> names has prevailed without extinguishing the former.
 The Swedes, who might well be satisfied with their own fame in arms, have in every age claimed the kindred glory of the Goths.
 In a moment of discontent against the court of Rome, Charles the Twelfth insinuated that his victorious troops were not degenerated from their brave ancestors who had already subdued the mistress of the world.
 (8) Religion of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> Till the end of the eleventh century, a celebrated temple subsisted at Upsal, the most considerable town of the <NORP>Swedes</NORP> and Goths.
 It was enriched with the gold which the <NORP>Scandinavians</NORP> had acquired in their piratical adventures, and sanctified by the uncouth representations of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> principal deities, the god of war, the goddess of generation, and the god of thunder.
 In the general festival that was solemnised every ninth year, <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> animals of every species (without excepting the human) were sacrificed, and their bleeding bodies suspended in the sacred grove adjacent to the temple.
 (9) The only traces that now subsist of this barbaric superstition are contained in the Edda, a system of mythology compiled in <GPE>Iceland</GPE> about the thirteenth century, and studied by the learned of <GPE>Denmark</GPE> and <GPE>Sweden</GPE> as the most valuable remains of their ancient traditions.
 Institutions and death of <PERSON>Odin</PERSON> Notwithstanding the mysterious obscurity of the Edda, we can easily distinguish <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> persons confounded under the name of Odin, the god of war, and the great legislator of Scandinavia.
 The latter, the <NORP>Mahomet</NORP> of the north, instituted a religion adapted to the climate and to the people.
 Numerous tribes on either side of the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> were subdued by the invincible valour of Odin, by his persuasive eloquence, and by the fame, which he acquired, of a most skilful magician.
 The faith that he had propagated during a long and prosperous life he confirmed by a voluntary death.
 Apprehensive of the ignominious approach of disease and infirmity, he resolved to expire as became a warrior.
 In a solemn assembly of the <NORP>Swedes</NORP> and Goths, he wounded himself in <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> mortal places, hastening away (as he asserted with his dying voice) to prepare the feast of heroes in the palace of the god of war.
 (10) Agreeable but uncertain hypothesis concerning <PERSON>Odin</PERSON> The native and proper habitation of <PERSON>Odin</PERSON> is distinguished by the appellation of As-gard.
 The unhappy resemblance of that name with As-burg, or As-of (11) words of a similar signification, has given rise to an historical system of so pleasing a conjecture that we could almost wish to persuade ourselves of its truth.
 It is supposed that <PERSON>Odin</PERSON> was the chief of a tribe of barbarians which dwelt on the banks of the lake Maetois, till the fall of <PRODUCT>Mithridates</PRODUCT> and the arms of <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> menaced the north with servitude.
 That Odin, yielding with indignant fury to a power which he was unable to resist, conducted his tribe from the frontiers of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> <GPE>Sarmatia</GPE> into <GPE>Sweden</GPE> with the great design of forming, in that inaccessible retreat of freedom, a religion and a people which, in some remote age, might be, subservient to his immortal revenge; when his invincible Goths, armed with martial fanaticism, should issue in numerous swarms from the neighbourhood of the <LOC>Polar</LOC> circle, to chastise the oppressors of mankind.
 (12) Emmigration of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> from <LOC>Scandinavia</LOC> into <GPE>Prussia</GPE> If so many successive generations of <NORP>Goths</NORP> were capable of preserving a faint tradition of their <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> origin, we must not expect, from such unlettered barbarians, any distinct account of the time and circumstances of their emigration.
 To cross the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> was an easy and natural attempt.
 The inhabitants of <GPE>Sweden</GPE> were masters of a sufficient number of large vessels, with oars, (13) and the distance is little more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles from <GPE>Carlscrona</GPE> to the nearest ports of <GPE>Pomerania</GPE> and Prussia.
 Here, at length, we land on firm and historic ground.
 At least as early as the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, (14) and as late as the age of the Antonines, (15) the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were established towards the mouth of the Vistula, and in that fertile province where the commercial cities of Thorn, Elbing, Koningsberg, and <GPE>Dantzic</GPE> were long afterwards founded.
 (16) Westward of the Goths, the numerous tribes of the <ORG>Vandals</ORG> were spread along the banks of the Oder, and the seacoast of <GPE>Pomerania</GPE> and Mecklenburg.
 A striking resemblance of manners, complexion, religion, and language, seemed to indicate that the <ORG>Vandals</ORG> and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were originally <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> great people.
 (17) The latter appear to have been subdivided into Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and Gepidae.
 (18) The distinction among the <ORG>Vandals</ORG> was more strongly marked by the independent names of Heruli, Burgundians, Lombards, and a variety of other petty states, many of which, in a future age, expanded themselves into powerful monarchies.
 From <GPE>Prussia</GPE> to the <NORP>Ukriane</NORP> In the age of the Antonines, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were still seated in Prussia.
 About the reign of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> Severus, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> province of <GPE>Dacia</GPE> had already experienced their proximity by frequent and destructive inroads.
 (19) In this interval, therefore, of about seventy years, we must place the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> migration of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> from the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> to the Euxine; but the cause that produced it lies concealed among the various motives which actuate the conduct of unsettled barbarians Either a pestilence or a famine, a victory or a defeat, an oracle of the gods or the eloquence of a daring leader, were sufficient to impel the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms on the milder climates of the south.
 Besides the influence of a martial religion, the numbers and spirit of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were equal to the most dangerous adventures.
 The use of round bucklers and short swords rendered them formidable in a close engagement; the manly obedience which they yielded to hereditary kings gave uncommon union and stability to their councils; (20) and the renowned Amala, the hero of that age, and the <ORDINAL>tenth</ORDINAL> ancestor of Theodoric, king of Italy, enforced, by the ascendant of personal merit, the prerogative of his birth, which he nation.
 (21) derived from the Anses, or demigods of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation increases in its march.
 The fame of a great enterprise excited the bravest warriors from all the <NORP>Vandalic</NORP> states of Germany, many of whom are seen a few years afterwards combating under the common standard of the Goths.
 (22) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> motions of the emigrants carried them to the banks of the Prypec, a river universally conceived by the ancients to be the southern branch of the Borysthenes.
 (23) The windings of that great stream through the plains of <GPE>Poland</GPE> and <GPE>Russia</GPE> gave a direction to their line of march, and a constant supply of fresh water and pasturage to their numerous herds of cattle.
 They followed the unknown course of the river, confident in their valour, and careless of whatever power might oppose their progress.
 The <LOC>Bastarnae</LOC> and the <NORP>Venedi</NORP> were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who presented themselves and the flower of their youth, either from choice or compulsion, increased the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The <LOC>Bastarnae</LOC> dwelt on the northern side of the Carpathian mountains; the immense tract of land that separated the <LOC>Bastarnae</LOC> from the savages of <GPE>Finland</GPE> was possessed, or rather wasted, by the Venedi; (24) we have some reason to believe that the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these nations, which distinguished itself in the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> war, (25) and was afterwards divided into the formidable tribes of the Peucini, the Borani, the Carpi, etc.
, derived its origin from the Germans.
 With better authority, a <NORP>Sarmatian</NORP> extraction may be assigned to the Venedi, who rendered themselves so famous in the middle ages.
 (26) Distinction of <NORP>Germans</NORP> and <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> But the confusion of blood and manners on that doubtful frontier often perplexed the most accurate observers.
 (27) As the <NORP>Goths</NORP> advanced near the <FAC>Euxine</FAC> Sea, they encountered a purer race of Sarmatians, the Jazyges, the Alani, and the <PERSON>Roxolani</PERSON> and they were probably the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Germans</NORP> who saw the mouth of the <LOC>Borysthenes</LOC> and of the Tanais.
 If we inquire into the characteristic marks of the people of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and of Sarmatia, we shall discover that those <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great portions of human kind were principally distinguished by fixed huts or movable tents, by a close dress of flowing garments, by the marriage of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> or of several wives, by a military force consisting, for the most part, either of infantry or cavalry; and above all by the use of the <NORP>Teutonic</NORP> or of the <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> language the last of which has been diffused by conquest from the confines of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to the neighbourhood of Japan.
 Description of the <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> The <NORP>Goths</NORP> were now in possession of the Ukraine, a country of considerable extent and uncommon fertility, intersected with navigable rivers, which, from either side, discharge themselves into the Borysthenes; and interspersed with large and lofty forests of oaks.
 The plenty of game and fish, the innumerable beehives, deposited in the hollows of old trees, and in the cavities of rocks, and forming, even in that rude age, a valuable branch of commerce, the size of the cattle, the temperature of the air, the aptness of the soil for every species of grain, and the luxuriancy of the vegetation, all displayed the liberality of Nature, and tempted the industry of man.
 (28) But the <NORP>Goths</NORP> withstood all these temptations, and still adhered to a life of idleness, of poverty, and of rapine.
 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> invade the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces.
 The <NORP>Scythian</NORP> hordes, which, towards the east, bordered on the new settlements of the Goths, presented nothing to their arms except the doubtful chance of an unprofitable victory.
 But the prospect of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> territories was far more alluring; and the fields of <GPE>Dacia</GPE> were covered with rich harvests, sown by the hands of an industrious, and exposed to be gathered by those of a warlike, people.
 It is probable that the conquests of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> maintained by his successors, less for any real advantage than for ideal dignity, had contributed to weaken the empire on that side.
 The new and unsettled province of <GPE>Dacia</GPE> was neither strong enough to resist, nor rich enough to satiate, the rapaciousness of the barbarians.
 As long as the remote banks of the <LOC>Dniester</LOC> were considered as the boundary of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> power, the fortifications of the Lower <LOC>Danube</LOC> were more carelessly guarded, and the inhabitants of <PERSON>Maesia</PERSON> lived in supine security, fondly conceiving themselves at an inaccessible distance from any barbarian invaders.
 The irruptions of the Goths, under the reign of Philip, fatally convinced them of their mistake.
 The king, or leader, of that fierce nation traversed with contempt the province of Dacia, and passed both the <LOC>Dniester</LOC> and the <LOC>Danube</LOC> without encountering any opposition capable of retarding his progress.
 The relaxed discipline of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops betrayed the most important posts where they were stationed, and the fear of deserved punishment induced great numbers of them to enlist under the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard.
 The various multitude of barbarians appeared, at length, under the walls of Marcianopolis, a city built by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> in honour of his sister, and at that time the capital of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Maesia.
 (29) The inhabitants consented to ransom their lives and property by the payment of a large sum of money, and the invaders retreated back into their deserts, animated, rather than satisfied, with the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> success of their arms against an opulent but feeble country.
 Intelligence was soon transmitted to the emperor <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> that Cniva, king of the Goths, had passed the <LOC>Danube</LOC> a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time, with more considerable forces; that his numerous detachments scattered devastation over the province of Maesia, whilst the main body of the army, consisting of seventy thousand <NORP>Germans</NORP> and Sarmatians, a force equal to the most daring achievements, required the presence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarch, and the exertion of his military power.
 Various events of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war.
 <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> found (A.
D.
 250) the <NORP>Goths</NORP> engaged before Nicopolis, on the Jatrus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the many monuments of Trajan's victories.
 (30) On his approach they raised the siege, but with a design only of marching away to a conquest of greater importance, the siege of Philippopolis, a city of Thrace, founded by the father of Alexander, near the foot of mount Haemus.
 (31) <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> followed them through a difficult country, and by forced marches; but when he imagined himself at a considerable distance from the rear of the Goths, <PERSON>Cniva</PERSON> turned with rapid fury on his pursuers.
 The camp of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was surprised and pillaged, and, for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time, their emperor fled in disorder before a.
 troop of half-armed barbarians.
 After a long resistance, Philippopolis, destitute of succour, was taken by storm.
 A hundred thousand persons are reported to have been massacred in the sack of that great city.
 (32) Many prisoners of consequence became a valuable accession to the spoil; and Priscus, a brother of the late emperor Philip, blushed not to assume the purple under the protection of the barbarous enemies of Rome.
 (33) The time, however consumed in that tedious siege enabled <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> to revive the courage, restore the discipline, and recruit the numbers of his troops.
 He intercepted several parties of Carpi, and other Germans, who were hastening to share the victory of their countrymen, (34) intrusted the passes of the mountains to officers of approved valour and fidelity; (35) repaired and strengthened the fortifications of the Danube, and exerted his utmost vigilance to oppose either the progress or the retreat of the Goths.
 Encouraged by the return of fortune, he anxiously waited for an opportunity to retrieve, by a great and decisive blow, his own glory and that of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms.
 (36) <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> revives the office of censor in the person of <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> At the same time when <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> was struggling with the violence of the tempest, his mind, calm and deliberate amidst the tumult of war, investigated the more general causes that, since the age of the Antonines, had so impetuously urged the decline of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He soon discovered that it was impossible to replace that greatness on a permanent basis without restoring public virtue, ancient principles and manners, and the oppressed majesty of the laws.
 To execute this noble but arduous design, he <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> resolved to revive the obsolete office of censor; an office which, as long as it had subsisted in its pristine integrity, had so much contributed to the perpetuity of the state, (37) till it was usurped and gradually neglected by the Caesars.
 (38) Conscious that the favour of the sovereign may confer power, but that the esteem of the people can alone bestow authority, he submitted the choice of the censor to the unbiased voice of the senate.
 By their unanimous votes, or rather acclamations, Valerian, who was afterwards emperor, and who then served with distinction in the army of Decius, was (A.
D.
 251, 27th Oct.
) declared the most worthy of that exalted honour.
 As soon as the decree of the senate was transmitted to the emperor, he assembled a great council in his camp, and, before the investiture of the censor elect, he apprised him of the difficulty and importance of his great office.
 The design impractical, and without effect.
 A magistrate, invested with such extensive powers, would have appeared not so much the minister as the colleague of his sovereign.
 (41) <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> justly dreaded an elevation so full of envy and of suspicion.
 He modestly urged the alarming greatness of the trust, his own insufficiency, and the incurable corruption of the times.
 He artfully insinuated that the office of censor was inseparable from the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> dignity, and that the feeble hands of a subject were unequal to the support of such an immense weight of cares and of power.
 (42) The approaching event of war soon put an end to the prosecution of a project so specious but so impracticable; and whilst it preserved <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> from the danger, saved the emperor <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> from the disappointment which would most probably have attended it.
 A censor may maintain, he can never restore, the morals of a state.
 It is impossible for such a magistrate to exert his authority with benefit, or even with effect, unless he is supported by a quick sense of honour and virtue in the minds of the people, by a decent reverence for the public opinion, and by a train of useful prejudices combating on the side of national manners.
 In a period when these principles are annihilated, the censorial jurisdiction must either sink into empty pageantry, or be converted into a partial instrument of vexatious oppression.
 (43) It was easier to vanquish the <NORP>Goths</NORP> than to eradicate the public vices yet even in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these enterprises <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> lost his army and his life.
 Defeat and death of <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> and his son The <NORP>Goths</NORP> were now, on every side, surrounded and pursued by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms.
 The flower of their troops had perished in the long siege of Philippopolis, and the exhausted country could no longer afford subsistence for the remaining multitude of licentious barbarians.
 Reduced to this extremity, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> would gladly have purchased, by the surrender of all their booty and prisoners, the permission of an undisturbed retreat.
 But the emperor, confident of victory and resolving, by the chastisement of these invaders, to strike a salutary terror into the nations of the North, refused to listen to any terms of accommodation.
 The high-spirited barbarians preferred death to slavery.
 An obscure town of Maesia, called Forum Terebronii, (44) was the scene of the battle.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army was drawn up in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> lines, and, either from choice or accident, the front of the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> line was covered by a morass.
 In the beginning of the action, the son of Decius, a youth of the fairest hopes, and already associated to the honours of the purple, was slain by an arrow, in the sight of his afflicted father; who, summoning all his fortitude, admonished the dismayed troops that the loss of a single soldier was of little importance to the republic.
 (45) The conflict was terrible; it was the combat of despair against grief and rage.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> line of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> at length gave way in disorder; the second, advancing to sustain it, shared its fate; and the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> only remained entire, prepared to dispute the passage of the morass, which was imprudently attempted by the presumption of the enemy.
In the morass the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army, after an ineffectual struggle, was irrecoverably lost; nor could the body of the emperor ever be found.
 (47) Such was the fate of Decius, in the fiftieth year of his age; an accomplished prince, active in war, and affable in peace, (48) who, together with his son, has deserved to be compared, both in life and death, with the brightest examples of ancient virtue.
 (49) Election of <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> This fatal blow humbled, for a very little time, the insolence of the legions.
 They appear to have patiently expected, and submissively obeyed, the decree of the senate, which regulated the succession to the throne.
 From a just regard for the memory of Decius, the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> title was (A.
D.
 251, Dec.
) conferred on Hostilianus, his only surviving son; but an equal rank, with more effectual power, was granted to Gallus, whose experience and ability seemed equal to the great trust of guardian to the young prince and the distressed empire.
 (50) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> care of the new emperor was to deliver the <NORP>IIlyrian</NORP> provinces from the intolerable weight of the victorious Goths.
 Retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> He (A.
D.
 252) consented to leave in their hands the rich fruits of their invasion, an immense booty, and, what was still more disgraceful, a great number of prisoners of the highest merit and quality.
 He plentifully supplied their camp with every convenience that could assuage their angry spirits, or facilitate their so much wished for departure; and he even promised to pay them annually a large sum of gold, on condition they should never afterwards infest the <NORP>Roman</NORP> territories by their incursions.
 (51) <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> purchases peace by the payment of an <DATE>annual</DATE> tribute.
 In the age of the Scipios, the most opulent kings of the earth, who courted the protection of the victorious commonwealth, were gratified with such trifling presents as could only derive a value from the hand that bestowed them; an ivory chair, a coarse garment of purple, an inconsiderable piece of plate, or a quantity of copper coin.
 (52) After the wealth of nations had centred in Rome, the emperors displayed their greatness, and even their policy, by the regular exercise of a steady and moderate liberality towards the allies of the state.
 They relieved the poverty of the barbarians, honoured their merit, and recompensed their fidelity.
 These voluntary marks of bounty were understood to flow not from the fears, but merely from the generosity or the gratitude of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and whilst presents and subsidies were liberally distributed among friends and suppliants, they were sternly refused to such as claimed them as a debt.
 (53) Popular discontent But this stipulation of an <DATE>annual</DATE> payment to a victorious enemy appeared without disguise in the light of an ignominious tribute; the minds of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were not yet accustomed to accept such unequal laws from a tribe of barbarians; and the prince who by a necessary concession had probably saved his country, became the object of the general contempt and aversion.
 The death of Hostilianus, though it happened in the midst of a raging pestilence, was interpreted as the personal crime of Gallus; (54) and even the defeat of the late emperor was ascribed by the voice of suspicion to the perfidious counsels of his hated successor.
 (55) The tranquillity which the empire enjoyed during the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> year of his administration (56) served rather to inflame than to appease the public discontent; and, as soon as the apprehensions of war were removed, the infamy of the peace was more deeply and more sensibly felt.
 Victory and revolt of <GPE>Aemilianus</GPE> But the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were irritated to a still higher degree when they discovered that they had not even secured their repose, though at the expense of their honour.
 The dangerous secret of the wealth and weakness of the empire had been revealed to the world.
 New swarms of barbarians, encouraged (A.
D.
 253) by the success, and not conceiving themselves bound by the obligation, of their brethren, spread devastation through the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> provinces, and terror as far as the gates of Rome.
 The defence of the monarchy which seemed abandoned by the pusillanimous emperor, was assumed by Aemilianus, governor of <GPE>Pannonia</GPE> and <PERSON>Maesia</PERSON> who rallied the scattered forces, and revived the fainting spirits of the troops.
 The barbarians were unexpectedly attacked, routed, chased, and pursued beyond the Danube.
 The victorious leader distributed as a donative the money collected for the tribute, and the acclamations of the soldiers proclaimed him emperor on the field of battle.
 (57) Gallus, who, careless of the general welfare, indulged himself in the pleasures of Italy, was almost in the same instant informed of the success of the revolt and of the rapid approach of his aspiring lieutenant.
 He advanced to meet him as far as the plains of Spoleto.
 When the armies came in sight of each other, the soldiers of <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> compared the ignominious conduct of their sovereign with the glory of his rival.
 They admired the valour of <GPE>Aemilianus</GPE> they were attracted by his liberality, for he offered a considerable increase of pay to all deserters.
 (58) <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> abandoned and slain The murder of Gallus, and of his son Volusianus, put an end to the civil war; and the senate (A.
D.
 253, <DATE>May)</DATE> gave a legal sanction to the rights of conquest.
 The letters of <GPE>Aemilianus</GPE> to that assembly displayed a mixture of moderation and vanity.
 He assured them that he should resign to their wisdom the civil administration; and, contenting himself with the quality of their general, would in a short time assert the glory of Rome, and deliver the empire from all the barbarians both of the <LOC>North</LOC> and of the East.
 (59) His pride was flattered by the applause of the senate; and medals are still extant representing him with the name and attributes of <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> and <PERSON>Victor</PERSON> and of Mars the Avenger.
 (60) <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> revenges the death of Gallus, and is acknowledged emperor If the new monarch possessed the abilities, he wanted the time necessary to fulfil these splendid promises.
 Less than four months intervened between his victory and his fall.
 (61) He had vanquished Gallus: he sunk under the weight of a competitor more formidable than Gallus.
 That unfortunate prince had sent Valerian, already distinguished by the honourable title of censor, to bring the legions of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> and <GPE>Germany</GPE> to his aid.
 (62) <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> executed that commission with zeal and fidelity; and as he arrived too late to save his sovereign, he resolved to revenge him.
 The troops of Aemilianus, who still lay encamped in the plains of Spoleto, were awed by the sanctity of his character, but much more by the superior strength of his army; and as they were now become as incapable of personal attachment as they had always been of constitutional principle, they (AD 253, Aug.
) readily imbrued their hands in the blood of a prince who had so lately been the object of their partial choice.
 The guilt was theirs, but the advantage of it was Valerian's; who obtained the possession of the throne by the means indeed of a civil war, but with a degree of innocence singular in that age of revolutions; since he owned neither gratitude nor allegiance to his predecessor whom he dethroned.
 Character of Valerian.
 <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> was about sixty years of age (63) when he was invested with the purple, not by the caprice of the populace, or the clamours of the army, but by the unanimous voice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 In his gradual ascent through the honours of the state, he had deserved the favour of virtuous princes, and had declared himself the enemy of tyrants.
 (64) His noble birth, his mild but unblemished manners, his learning, prudence, and experience, were revered by the senate and people; and if mankind (according to the observation of an ancient writer) had been left at liberty to choose a master, their choice would most assuredly have fallen on Valerian.
 (65) Perhaps the merit of this emperor was inadequate to his reputation; perhaps his abilities, or at least his spirit, were affected by the languor and coldness of old age.
 General misfortunes of the reigns of <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> and Gallienus, A.
D.
 253-268.
 The consciousness of his decline engaged him to share the throne with a younger and more active associate: (66) the emergency of the times demanded a general no less than a prince; and the experience of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> censor might have directed him where to bestow the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> purple, as the reward of military merit.
 But instead of making a judicious choice, which would have confirmed his reign and endeared his memory, Valerian, consulting only the dictates of affection or vanity, immediately invested with the supreme honours his son Gallienus, a youth whose effeminate vices had been hitherto concealed by the obscurity of a private station.
 The joint government of the father and the son subsisted about seven, and the sole administration of <PERSON>Gallienus</PERSON> continued about eight, years .
 But the whole period was <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> uninterrupted series of confusion and calamity.
 As the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was at the same time, and on every side, attacked by the blind fury of foreign invaders, and the wild ambition of domestic usurpers, we shall consult order and perspicuity by pursuing not so much the doubtful arrangement of dates as the more natural distribution of subjects.
 Inroads of the barbarians.
 The most dangerous enemies of Rome, during the reigns of <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> and Gallienus, were, 1The Franks; 2.
 The Alemanni; 3.
 The Goths; and 4.
 The Persians.
 Under these general appellations we may comprehend the adventures of less considerable tribes, whose obscure and uncouth names would only serve to oppress the memory and perplex the attention of the reader.
 Origin and confederacy of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> I.
 As the posterity of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> compose <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the greatest and most enlightened nations of Europe, the powers of learning and ingenuity have been exhausted in the discovery of their unlettered ancestors.
 To the tales of credulity have succeeded the systems of fancy.
 Every passage has been sifted, every spot has been surveyed, that might possibly reveal some faint traces of their origin.
 It has been supposed that Pannonia, (67) that Gaul, that the northern parts of Germany, (68) gave birth to that celebrated colony of warriors.
 At length the most rational critics, rejecting the fictitious emigrations of ideal conquerors, have acquiesced in a sentiment whose simplicity persuades us of its truth.
 (69) They suppose that, about the year <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and forty, (70) a new confederacy was formed under the name of Franks, by the old inhabitants of the Lower <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and the Weser.
 The present circle of Westphalia, the Landgraviate of Hesse, and the duchies of <GPE>Brunswick</GPE> and Luneburg, were the ancient seat of the Chauci, who, in their inaccessible morasses, defied the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms; (71) of the Cherusci, proud of the fame of Arminius; of the Catti, formidable by their firm and intrepid infantry; and of several other tribes of inferior power and renown.
 (72) The love of liberty was the ruling passion of these Germans; the enjoyment of it their best treasure; the word that expressed that enjoyment the most pleasing to their ear.
 They deserved, they assumed, they maintained the honourable epithet of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> or Freemen; which concealed, though it did not extinguish, the peculiar names of the several states of the confederacy.
 (73) Tacit consent, and mutual advantage, dictated the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> laws of the union; it was gradually cemented by habit and experience.
 The league of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> may admit of some comparison with the <PERSON>Helvetic</PERSON> body; in which every canton, retaining its independent sovereignty, consults with its brethren in the common cause, without acknowledging the authority of any supreme head or representative assembly.
 (74) But the principle of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> confederacies were extremely different.
 A peace of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred years has rewarded the wise and honest policy of the Swiss.
 An inconstant spirit, the thirst of rapine, and a disregard to the most solemn treaties, disgraced the character of the Franks.
 They invade <LOC>Gaul</LOC> The <NORP>Romans</NORP> had long experienced the daring valour of the people of Lower Germany.
 The union of their strength threatened <LOC>Gaul</LOC> with a more formidable invasion, and required the presence of Gallienus, the heir and colleague of imperial power.
 (75) Whilst that prince, and his infant son Salonius, displayed, in the court of Treves, the majesty of the empire, its armies were ably conducted by their general Posthumus, who, though he afterwards betrayed the family of Valerian, was ever faithful for the great interest of the monarchy.
 The treacherous language of panegyrics and medals darkly announces a long series of victories.
 Trophies and titles attest (if such evidence can attest) the fame of Posthumus, who is repeatedly styled The Conqueror of the Germans, and the saviour of <WORK_OF_ART>Gaul.
</WORK_OF_ART> (76) Ravage <GPE>Spain</GPE> But a single fact, the only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> indeed of which we have any distinct knowledge, erases, in a great measure, these monuments of vanity and adulation.
 The Rhine, though dignified with the title of Safeguard of the provinces, was an imperfect barrier against the daring spirit of enterprise with which the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> were actuated.
 Their rapid devastations stretched from the river to the foot of the Pyrenees: nor were they stopped by those mountains.
 Spain, which had never dreaded, was unable to resist, the inroads of the Germans.
 During <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years, the greatest part of the reign of Gallienus, that opulent country was the theatre of unequal and destructive hostilities.
 Tarragona, the flourishing capital of a peaceful province, was sacked and almost destroyed (77) and so late as the days of Orosius, who wrote in the fifth century, wretched cottages, scattered amidst the ruins of magnificent cities, still recorded the rage of the barbarians.
 (78) and pass over into <LOC>Africa</LOC> When the exhausted country no longer supplied a variety of plunder, the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> seized on some vessels in the ports of Spain, (79) and transported themselves into Mauritania.
 The distant province was astonished with the fury of these barbarians, who seemed to fall from a new world, as their name, manners, and complexion were equally unknown on the coast of Africa.
 (80) Origin and renown of the <GPE>Suevi</GPE> II.
 In that part of Upper Saxony beyond the Elbe, which is at present called the Marquisate of Lusace, there existed, in ancient times, a sacred wood, the awful seat of the superstition of the Suevi.
 None were permitted to enter the holy precincts without confessing, by their servile bonds and suppliant posture, the immediate presence of the sovereign Deity.
 (81) Patriotism contributed as well as devotion to consecrate the Sonnenwald, or wood of the Semnones.
 (82) It was universally believed that the nation had received its <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> existence on that sacred spot.
 At stated periods, the numerous tribes who gloried in the <NORP>Suevic</NORP> blood resorted thither by their ambassadors; and the memory of their common extraction was perpetuated by barbaric rites and human sacrifices.
 The wide extended name of <GPE>Suevi</GPE> filled the interior countries of <GPE>Germany</GPE> from the banks of the <LOC>Oder</LOC> to those of the Danube.
 They were distinguished from the other <NORP>Germans</NORP> by their peculiar mode of dressing their long hair, which they gathered into a rude knot on the crown of the head; and they delighted in an ornament that showed their ranks more lofty and terrible in the eyes of the enemy.
 (83) Jealous as the <NORP>Germans</NORP> were of military renown, they all confessed the superior valour of the Suevi; and the tribes of the <NORP>Usipetes</NORP> and Tencteri, who, with a vast army, encountered the dictator Caesar, declared that they esteemed it not a disgrace to have fled before a people to whose arms the immortal gods themselves were unequal.
 (84) A mixed body of <GPE>Suevi</GPE> assume the name of <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> In the reign of the emperor Caracalla, an innumerable swarm of <GPE>Suevi</GPE> appeared on the banks of the Mein, and in the neighbourhood of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces, in quest either of food, of plunder, or of glory.
 (85) The hasty army of volunteers gradually coalesced into a great and permanent nation, and as it was composed from so many different tribes, assumed the name of Alemanni, or All-men; to denote at once their various lineage and their common bravery.
 (86) The latter was soon felt by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> in many a hostile inroad.
 The <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> fought chiefly on horseback; but their cavalry was rendered still more formidable by a mixture of light infantry, selected from the bravest and most active of the youth, whom frequent exercise had enured to accompany the horsemen in the longest march, the most rapid charge, or the most precipitate retreat.
 (87) Invade <LOC>Gaul</LOC> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> This warlike people of <NORP>Germans</NORP> had been astonished by the immense preparations of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> Severus; they were dismayed by the arms of his successor, a barbarian equal in valour and fierceness to themselves.
 But still hovering on the frontiers of the empire, they increased the general disorder that ensued after the death of Decius.
 They inflicted severe wounds on the rich provinces of Gaul; they were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who removed the veil that covered the feeble majesty of Italy.
 A numerous body of the <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> penetrated across the Danube, and through the Rhaetian Alps, into the plains of Lombardy, advanced as far as Ravenna, and displayed the victorious banners of barbarians almost in sight of Rome.
 (88) The insult and the danger rekindled in the senate some sparks of their ancient virtue.
 are repulsed from <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the senate and people Both the emperors were engaged in far distant wars, <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> in the <LOC>East</LOC> and <PERSON>Gallienus</PERSON> on the Rhine.
 All the hopes and resources of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were in themselves.
 In this emergency, the senators resumed the defence of the republic, drew out the <PERSON>Praetorian</PERSON> guards, who had been left to garrison the capital, and filled up their numbers by enlisting into the public service the stoutest and most willing of the Plebeians.
 The Alemanni, astonished with the sudden appearance of an army more numerous than their own, retired into <GPE>Germany</GPE> laden with spoil; and their retreat was esteemed as a victory by the unwarlike Romans.
 (89) The senators excluded by <PERSON>Gallienus</PERSON> from military service When <PERSON>Gallienus</PERSON> received the intelligence that his capital was delivered from the barbarians, he was much less delighted than alarmed with the courage of the senate, since it might <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day prompt them to rescue the republic from domestic tyranny as well as from foreign invasion.
 His timid ingratitude was published to his subjects in an edict which prohibited the senators from exercising any military employment, and even from approaching the camps of the legions.
 But his fears were groundless.
 The rich and luxurious nobles, sinking into their natural character, accepted, as a favour, this disgraceful exemption from military service; and as long as they were indulged in the enjoyment of their baths, their theatres, and their villas, they cheerfully resigned the more dangerous cares of empire to the rough hands of peasants and soldiers.
 (90) <PERSON>Gallienus</PERSON> contreacts an alliance with the <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> Another invasion of the Alemanni, of a more formidable aspect, but more glorious event, is mentioned by a writer of the lower empire.
 Three hundred thousand of that warlike people are said to have been vanquished, in a battle near Milan, by <PERSON>Gallienus</PERSON> in person at the head of only ten thousand Romans.
 (91) We may, however, with great probability, ascribe this incredible victory either to the credulity of the historian or to some exaggerated exploits of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the emperor's lieutenants.
 It was by arms of a very different nature that <PERSON>Gallienus</PERSON> endeavoured to protect <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the fury of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> He espoused Pipa, the daughter of a king of the Marcomanni, a <NORP>Suevic</NORP> tribe, which was often confounded with the <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> in their wars and conquests.
 (92) To the father, as the price of his alliance, he granted an ample settlement in Pannonia.
 The native charms of unpolished beauty seem to have fixed the daughter in the affections of the inconstant emperor, and the bands of policy were more firmly connected by those of love.
 But the haughty prejudice of <GPE>Rome</GPE> still refused the name of marriage to the profane mixture of a citizen and a barbarian; and has stigmatised the <NORP>German</NORP> princess with the opprobrious title of concubine of Gallienus.
 (93) Inroads of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> III.
 We have already traced the emigration of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> from Scandinavia, or at least from Prussia, to the mouth of the Borysthenes, and have followed their victorious arms from the <LOC>Borysthenes</LOC> to the Danube.
 Under the reigns of <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> and Gallienus, the frontier of the last mentioned river was perpetually infested by the inroads of <NORP>Germans</NORP> and <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> but it was defended by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> with more than usual firmness and success.
 The provinces that were the seat of war recruited the armies of <GPE>Rome</GPE> with an inexhaustible supply of hardy soldiers; and more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> peasants attained the station and displayed the abilities of a general.
 Though flying parties of the barbarians, who incessantly hovered on the banks of the Danube, penetrated sometimes to the confines of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Macedonia, their progress was commonly checked, or their return intercepted, by the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> lieutenants.
 (94) But the great stream of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hostilities was diverted into a very different channel.
 The Goths, in their new settlement of the Ukraine, soon became masters of the northern coast of the Euxine: to the south of that inland sea were situated the soft and wealthy provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, which possessed all that could attract, and nothing that could resist, a barbarian conqueror.
 Conquest of the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> The banks of the <LOC>Borysthenes</LOC> are only sixty miles distant from the narrow entrance (95) of the peninsula of Crim Tartary, known to the ancients under the name of Chersonesus Taurica.
 (96) On that inhospitable shore, Euripides, embellishing with exquisite art the tales of antiquity, has placed the scene of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his most affecting tragedies.
 (97) The bloody sacrifices of Diana, the arrival of <PERSON>Orestes</PERSON> and Pylades, and the triumph of virtue and religion over savage fierceness, serve to represent an historical truth, that the Tauri, the original inhabitants of the peninsula, were, in some degree, reclaimed from their brutal manners by a gradual intercourse with the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> colonies which settled along the maritime coast.
 The little kingdom of Bosphorus, whose capital was situated on the Straits, through which the <NORP>Maeotis</NORP> communicates itself to the Euxine, was composed of degenerate <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and half-civilised barbarians.
 It subsisted, as an independent state, from the time of the Peloponnesian war, (98) was at last swallowed up by the ambition of Mithridates, (99) and, with the rest of his dominions, sunk under the weight of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms.
 From the reign of Augustus, (100) the kings of <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> were the humble, but not useless, allies of the empire.
 By presents, by arms, and by a slight fortification drawn across the Isthmus, they effectually guarded against the roving plunderers of <GPE>Sarmatia</GPE> the access of a country which, from its peculiar situation and convenient harbours, commanded the <FAC>Euxine</FAC> Sea and <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor.
 (101) As long as the sceptre was possessed by a lineal succession of kings, they acquitted themselves of their important charge with vigilance and success.
 Domestic factions, and the fears, or private interest, of obscure usurpers, who seized on the vacant throne, admitted the <NORP>Goths</NORP> into the heart of Bosphorus.
 who acquire a naval force With the acquisition of a superfluous waste of fertile soil, the conquerors obtained the command of a naval force, sufficient to transport their armies to the coast of Asia.
 (102) The ships used in the navigation of the <FAC>Euxine</FAC> were of a very singular construction.
 They were slight flat-bottomed barks framed of timber only, without the least mixture of iron, and occasionally covered with a shelving roof on the appearance of a tempest.
 (103) In these floating houses, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> carelessly trusted themselves to the mercy of an unknown sea, under the conduct of sailors pressed into the service, and whose skill and fidelity were equally suspicious.
 But the hopes of plunder had banished every idea of danger, and a natural fearlessness of temper supplied in their minds the more rational confidence which is the just result of knowledge and experience.
 Warriors of such a daring spirit must have often murmured against the cowardice of their guides who required the strongest assurances of a settled calm before they would venture to embark; and would scarcely ever be tempted to lose sight of the land.
 Such, at least, is the practise of the modern Turks, (104) and they are probably not inferior in the art of navigation to the ancient inhabitants of Bosphorus.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> naval expidition of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> The fleet of the Goths, leaving the coast of <GPE>Circassia</GPE> on the left hand, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> appeared before Pityus, (105) the utmost limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces; a city provided with a convenient port and fortified with a strong wall.
 Here they met with a resistance more obstinate than they had reason to expect from the feeble garrison of a distant fortress.
 They were repulsed; and their disappointment seemed to diminish the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> name.
 As long as Successianus, an officer of superior rank and merit, defended that frontier, all their efforts were ineffectual; but as soon as he was removed by <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> to a more honourable but less important station, they resumed the attack of Pityus; and, by the destruction of that city, obliterated the memory of their former disgrace.
 (106) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> besiege and take <PRODUCT>Trebizond</PRODUCT> Circling round the eastern extremity of the <FAC>Euxine</FAC> Sea, the navigation from <GPE>Pityus</GPE> to <PRODUCT>Trebizond</PRODUCT> is about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 (107) The course of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> carried them in sight of the country of Colchis, so famous by the expedition of the Argonauts, and they even attempted, though without success, to pillage a rich temple at the mouth of the river Phasis.
 Trebizond, celebrated in the retreat of the Ten Thousand as an ancient colony of Greeks, (108) derived its wealth and splendour from the munificence of the emperor Hadrian, who had constructed an artificial port on a coast left destitute by nature of secure harbours.
 (109) The city was large and populous; a double enclosure of walls seemed to defy the fury of the Goths, and the usual garrison had been strengthened by a reinforcement of ten thousand men.
 But there are not any advantages capable of supplying the absence of discipline and vigilance.
 The numerous garrison of Trebizond, dissolved in riot and luxury, disdained to guard their impregnable fortifications.
 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> soon discovered the supine negligence of the besieged, erected a lofty pile of fascines, ascended the walls in the silence of the night, and entered the defenceless city sword in hand.
 A general massacre of the people ensued, whilst the affrighted soldiers escaped through the opposite gates of the town.
 The most holy temples, and the most splendid edifices, were involved in a common destruction.
 The booty that fell into the hands of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was immense: the wealth of the adjacent countries had been deposited in Trebizond, as in a secure place of refuge.
 The number of captives was incredible, as the victorious barbarians ranged without opposition through the extensive province of Pontus.
 (110) The rich spoils of <PRODUCT>Trebizond</PRODUCT> filled a great fleet of ships that had been found in the port.
 The robust youth of the seacoast were chained to the oar; and the Goths, satisfied with the success of their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> naval expedition, returned in triumph to their new establishments in the kingdom of Bosphorus.
 (111) The <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> Expedition Of The <NORP>Goths</NORP> The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> expedition of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was undertaken with greater powers of men and ships; but they steered a different course, and, disdaining the exhausted provinces of Pontus, followed the western coast of the Euxine, passed before the wide mouths of the Borysthenes, the Dniester, and the Danube, and increasing their fleet by the capture of a great number of fishing barks, they approached the narrow outlet through which the <FAC>Euxine</FAC> Sea pours its waters into the Mediterranean, and divides the continents of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia.
 The garrison of <GPE>Chalcedon</GPE> was encamped near the temple of Jupiter Urius on a promontory that commanded the entrance of the Strait; and so dreaded were the invasions of the barbarians, that this body of troops surpassed in number the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 But it was in numbers alone that they surpassed it.
 They plunder the cities of <PRODUCT>Bithynia</PRODUCT> They deserted with precipitation their advantageous post, and abandoned the town of Chalcedon, most plentifully stored with arms and money, to the discretion of the conquerors.
 Whilst they hesitated whether they should prefer the sea or land, <LOC>Europe</LOC> or Asia, for the scene of their hostilities, a perfidious fugitive pointed out Nicomedia, once the capital of the kings of Bithynia, as a rich and easy conquest.
 He guided the march, which was only sixty miles from the camp of Chalcedon, (112) directed the resistless attack, and partook of the booty; for the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had learned sufficient policy to reward the traitor whom they detested.
 Nice, Prusa, Apamaea, Cius, cities that had sometimes rivalled, or imitated, the splendour of Nicomedia, were involved in the same calamity, which, in a few weeks, raged without control through the whole province of Bithynia.
 Three hundred years of peace, enjoyed by the soft inhabitants of Asia, had abolished the exercise of arms and removed the apprehension of danger.
 The ancient walls were suffered to moulder away, and all the revenue of the most opulent cities was reserved for the construction of baths, temples, and theatres.
 (113) The Retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> When the city of <GPE>Cyzicus</GPE> withstood the utmost effort of Mithridates, (114) it was distinguished by wise laws, a naval power of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred galleys, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> arsenals: of arms, of military engines, and of corn.
 (115) It was still the seat of wealth and luxury; but of its ancient strength nothing remained except the situation, in a little island of the Propontis, connected with the continent of <LOC>Asia</LOC> only by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bridges.
 From the recent sack of Prusa, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> advanced within eighteen miles (116) of the city, which they had devoted to destruction, but the ruin of <GPE>Cyzicus</GPE> was delayed by a fortunate accident.
 The season was rainy, and the lake Apolloniates, the reservoir of all the springs of Mount Olympus, rose to an uncommon height.
 The little river of Rhyndacus, which issues from the lake, swelled into a broad and rapid stream, and stopped the progress of the Goths.
 Their retreat to the maritime city of Heraclea, where the fleet had probably been stationed, was attended by a long train of waggons, laden with the spoils of Bithynia, and was marked by the flames of <PRODUCT>Nice</PRODUCT> and Nicomedia, which they wantonly burnt.
 (117) Some obscure hints are mentioned of a doubtful combat that secured their retreat.
 (118) But even a complete victory would have been of little moment, as the approach of the autumnal equinox summoned them to hasten their return.
 To navigate the <FAC>Euxine</FAC> before the month of May, or after that of September, is esteemed by the modern <NORP>Turks</NORP> the most unquestionable instance of rashness and folly.
 (119) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> naval expidition of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> When we are informed that the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> fleet, equipped by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in the ports of Bosphorus, consisted of five hundred sail of ships, (120) our ready imagination instantly computes and multiplies the formidable armament; but as we are assured, by the judicious Strabo, (121) that the piratical vessels used by the barbarians of <GPE>Pontus</GPE> and the Lesser <GPE>Scythia</GPE> were not capable of containing more than twenty-five or <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> men, we may safely affirm that fifteen thousand warriors, at the most, embarked in this great expedition.
 Impatient of the limits of the Euxine, they steered their destructive course from the <NORP>Cimmerian</NORP> to the Thracian Bosphorus.
 They pass the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> and the <LOC>Hellespont</LOC> When they had almost gained the middle of the Straits, they were suddenly driven back to the entrance of them, till a favourable wind springing up the next day carried them in a few hours into the placid sea, or rather lake, of the Propontis.
 Their landing on the little island of <GPE>Cyzicus</GPE> was attended with the ruin of that ancient and noble city.
 From thence issuing again through the narrow passage of the Hellespont, they pursued their winding navigation amidst the numerous islands scattered over the Archipelago, or the Agean Sea.
 The assistance of captives and deserters must have been very necessary to pilot their vessels and to direct their various incursions, as well on the coast of <GPE>Greece</GPE> as on that of Asia.
 At length the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> fleet anchored in the port of Piraeus, five miles distant from Athens, (122) which had attempted to make some preparations for a vigorous defence.
 Cleodamus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the engineers employed by the emperor's orders to fortify the maritime cities against the Goths, had already begun to repair the ancient walls fallen to decay since the time of Sulla.
 The efforts of his skill were ineffectual, and the barbarians became masters of the native seat of the muses and the arts.
 But while the conquerors abandoned themselves to the licence of plunder and intemperance, their fleet, that lay with a slender guard in the harbour of Piraeus, was unexpectedly attacked by the brave Dexippus, who, flying with the engineer <PERSON>Cleodamus</PERSON> from the sack of Athens, collected a hasty band of volunteers, peasants as well as soldiers, and in some measure avenged the calamities of his country.
 (123) ravage Greece, and threaten <GPE>Italy</GPE> But this exploit, whatever lustre it might shed on the declining age of Athens, served rather to irritate than to subdue the undaunted spirit of the northern invaders.
 A general conflagration blazed out at the same time in every district of Greece.
 <GPE>Thebes</GPE> and Argos, <GPE>Corinth</GPE> and Sparta, which had formerly waged such memorable wars against each other, were now unable to bring an army into the field, or even to defend their ruined fortifications.
 The rage of war, both by land and by sea, spread from the eastern point of <GPE>Sunium</GPE> to the western coast of Epirus.
 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> had already advanced within sight of Italy, when the approach of such imminent danger awakened the indolent <PERSON>Gallienus</PERSON> from his dream of pleasure.
 The emperor appeared in arms; and his presence seems to have checked the ardour, and to have divided the strength, of the enemy.
 Their divisions and retreat Naulobatus, a chief of the Heruli, accepted an honourable capitulation, entered with a large body of his countrymen into the service of Rome, and was invested with the ornaments of the consular dignity, which had never before been profaned by the hands of a barbarian.
 (124) Great numbers of the Goths, disgusted with the perils and hardships of a tedious voyage, broke into Measia, with a design of forcing their way over the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to their settlements in the Ukraine.
 The wild attempt would have proved inevitable destruction if the discord of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals had not opened to the barbarians the means of an escape.
 (125) The small remainder of this destroying host returned on board their vessels; and measuring back their way through the <LOC>Hellespont</LOC> and the Bosphorus, ravaged in their passage the shores of Troy, whose fame, immortalised by Homer, will probably survive the memory of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conquests.
 As soon as they found themselves in safety within the basin of the Euxine, they landed at <GPE>Anchialus</GPE> in Thrace, near the foot of Mount Haemus; and, after all their toils, indulged themselves in the use of those pleasant and salutary hot baths.
 What remained of the voyage was a short and easy navigation.
 (126) Such was the various fate of this <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> and greatest of their naval enterprises.
 It may seem difficult to conceive how the original body of fifteen thousand warriors could sustain the losses and divisions of so bold an adventure.
 But as their numbers were gradually wasted by the sword, by shipwrecks, and by the influence of a warm climate, they were perpetually renewed by troops of banditti and deserters, who flocked to the standard of plunder, and by a crowd of fugitive slaves, often of <NORP>German</NORP> or <NORP>Sarmatian</NORP> extraction, who eagerly seized the glorious opportunity of freedom and revenge.
 In these expeditions, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation claimed a superior share of honour and danger; but the tribes that fought under the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> banners are sometimes distinguished and sometimes confounded in the imperfect histories of that age; and as the barbarian fleets seemed to issue from the mouth of the Tanais, the vague but familiar appellation of <NORP>Scythians</NORP> was frequently bestowed on the mixed multitude.
 (127) Ruin of the temple of <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> In the general calamities of mankind the death of an individual, however exalted, the ruin of an edifice, however famous, are passed over with careless inattention.
 Yet we cannot forget that the temple of <PERSON>Diana</PERSON> at Ephesus, after having risen with increasing splendour from <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> repeated misfortunes, (128) was finally burnt by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in their <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> naval invasion.
 The arts of Greece, and the wealth of Asia, had conspired to erect that sacred and magnificent structure.
 It was supported by an hundred and twenty-seven marble columns of the <ORG>Ionic</ORG> order.
 They were the gifts of devout monarchs, and each was sixty feet high.
 The altar was adorned with the masterly sculptures of Praxiteles, who had, perhaps, selected from the favourite legends of the place the birth of the divine children of Latona, the concealment of <PERSON>Apollo</PERSON> after the slaughter of the Cyclops, and the clemency of <PERSON>Bacchus</PERSON> to the vanquished Amazons.
 (129) Yet the length of the temple of <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> was only four hundred and twenty-five feet, about two-thirds of the measure of the church of St.
 Peter's at Rome.
 (130) In the other dimensions it was still more inferior to that sublime production of modern architecture.
 The spreading arms of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> cross require a much greater breadth than the oblong temples of the Pagans; and the boldest artists of antiquity would have been startled at the proposal of raising in the air a dome of the size and proportions of the Pantheon.
 The temple of <PERSON>Diana</PERSON> was, however, admired as <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the wonders of the world.
 Successive empires, the Persian, the Macedonian, and the Roman, had revered its sanctity and enriched its splendour.
 (131) But the rude savages of the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> were destitute of a taste for the elegant arts, and they despised the ideal terrors of a foreign superstition.
 (132) Conduct of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> at <GPE>Athens</GPE> Another circumstance is related of these invasions which might deserve our notice, were it not justly to be suspected as the fanciful conceit of a recent sophist.
 We are told that in the sack of <GPE>Athens</GPE> the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had collected all the libraries, and were on the point of setting fire to this funeral pile of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> learning, had not <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their chiefs, of more refined policy than his brethren, dissuaded them from the design; by the profound observation that as long as the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were addicted to the study of books, they could never apply themselves to the exercise of arms.
 (133) The sagacious counsellor (should the truth of the fact be admitted) reasoned like an ignorant barbarian.
 In the most polite and powerful nations, genius of every kind has displayed itself about the same period; and the age of science has generally been the age of military virtue and success.
 Conquest of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> by the <NORP>Persians</NORP> IV.
 The new sovereigns of Persia, <PERSON>Artaxerxes</PERSON> and his son Sapor, had triumphed over the house of Arsaces.
 Of the many princes of that ancient race, Chosroes, king of Armenia, had alone preserved both his life and his independence.
 He defended himself by the natural strength of his country; by the perpetual resort of fugitives and malcontents; by the alliance of the Romans, and, above all, by his own courage.
 Invincible in arms, during a <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years' war, he was at length assassinated by the emissaries of Sapor, king of Persia.
 The patriotic satraps of Armenia, who asserted the freedom and dignity of the crown, implored the protection of <GPE>Rome</GPE> in favour of <PERSON>Tiridates</PERSON> the lawful heir.
 But the son of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was an infant, the allies were at a distance, and the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch advanced towards the frontier at the head of an irresistible force.
 Young Tiridates, the future hope of his country, was saved by the fidelity of a servant, and <GPE>Armenia</GPE> continued above twenty-seven years a reluctant province of the great monarchy of Persia.
 (134) Elated with this easy conquest, and presuming on the distresses or the degeneracy of the Romans, <LOC>Sapor</LOC> obliged the strong garrisons of <GPE>Carrhae</GPE> and <NORP>Nisibis</NORP> to surrender, and spread devastation and terror on either side of the Euphrates.
 <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> marches into the <LOC>East</LOC> The loss of an important frontier, the ruin of a faithful and natural ally, and the rapid success of Sapor's ambition, affected <GPE>Rome</GPE> with a deep sense of the insult as well as of the danger.
 <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> flattered himself that the vigilance of is lieutenants would sufficiently provide for the safety of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and of the Danube; but he resolved, notwithstanding his advanced age, to march in person to the defence of the Euphrates.
 During his progress through <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, the naval enterprises of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were suspended, and the afflicted province enjoyed a transient and fallacious calm.
Is defeated and taken prisoner by <LOC>Sapor</LOC> King of <GPE>Persia</GPE> He passed the Euphrates, encountered the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch near the walls of Edessa, was (A.
D.
 260) vanquished and taken prisoner by Sapor.
 The particulars of this great event are darkly and imperfectly represented; yet by the glimmering light which is afforded us, we may discover a long series of imprudence, of error, and of deserved misfortunes on the side of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 He reposed an implicit confidence in Macrinus, his <PERSON>Praetorian</PERSON> praefect.
 (135) That worthless minister rendered his master formidable only to the oppressed subjects, and contemptible to the enemies of Rome.
 (136) By his weak or wicked counsels, the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> Army was betrayed into a situation where valour and military skill were equally unavailing.
 (137) The vigorous attempt of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to cut their way through the <NORP>Persian</NORP> host was repulsed with great slaughter; (138) and Sapor, who encompassed the camp with superior numbers, patiently waited till the increasing rage of famine and pestilence had ensured his victory.
 The licentious murmurs of the legions soon accused <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> as the cause of their calamities; their seditious clamours demanded an instant capitulation.
 An immense sum of gold was offered to purchase the permission of a disgraceful retreat.
 But the Persian, conscious of his superiority, refused the money with disdain; and detaining the deputies, advanced in order of battle to the foot of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> rampart, and insisted on a personal conference with the emperor.
 <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> vas reduced to the necessity of intrusting his life and dignity to the faith of an enemy.
 The interview ended as it was natural to expect.
 The emperor was made a prisoner, and his astonished troops laid down their arms.
 (139) In such a moment of triumph, the pride and policy of <LOC>Sapor</LOC> prompted him to fill the vacant throne with a successor entirely dependent on his pleasure.
 Cyriades, an obscure fugitive of Antioch, stained with every vice, was chosen to dishonour the <NORP>Roman</NORP> purple; and the will of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> victor could not fail of being ratified by the acclamations, however reluctant, of the captive army.
( (140) <LOC>Sapor</LOC> overuns Syria,Cilicia, and <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> The <ORG>Imperial</ORG> slave was eager to secure the favour of his master by an act of treason to his native country.
 He conducted <LOC>Sapor</LOC> over the Euphrates, and by the way of <GPE>Chalcis</GPE> to the metropolis of the East.
 So rapid were the motions of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> cavalry that, if we may credit a very judicious historian, (141) the city of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> was surprised when the idle multitude was fondly gazing on the amusements of the theatre.
 The splendid buildings of Antioch, private as well as public, were either pillaged or destroyed; and the numerous inhabitants were put to the sword, or led away into captivity.
 (142) The tide of devastation was stopped for a moment by the resolution of the high priest of Emesa.
 Arrayed in his sacerdotal robes, he appeared at the head of a great body of fanatic peasants, armed only with slings, and defended his god and his property from the sacrilegious hands of the followers of Zoroaster.
 (143) But the ruin of Tarsus, and many other cities, furnishes a melancholy proof that, except in this single instance, the conquest of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and <GPE>Cilicia</GPE> scarcely interrupted the progress of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> arms.
 The advantages of the narrow passes of Mount <LOC>Taurus</LOC> were abandoned, in which an invader, whose principal force consisted in his cavalry, would have been engaged in a very unequal combat: and <LOC>Sapor</LOC> was permitted to form the siege of Caesarea, the capital of Cappadocia; a city, though of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> rank, which was supposed to contain four hundred thousand inhabitants.
 <PERSON>Demosthenes</PERSON> commanded in the place, not so much by the commission of the emperor, as in the voluntary defence of his country.
 For a long time he deferred it's fate; and, when at last <PERSON>Caesarea</PERSON> was betrayed by the perfidy of a physician, he cut his way through the Persians, who had been ordered to exert their utmost diligence to take him alive.
 This heroic chief escaped the power of a foe, who might either have honoured or punished his obstinate valour; but many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of his fellow-citizens were involved in a general massacre, and <LOC>Sapor</LOC> is accused of treating his prisoners with wanton and unrelenting cruelty.
 (144) Much should undoubtedly be allowed for national animosity, much for humbled pride and impotent revenge; yet, upon the whole, it is certain that the same prince, who, in Armenia, had displayed the mild aspect of a legislator, showed himself to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> under the stern features of a conqueror.
 He despaired of making any permanent establishment in the empire, and sought only to leave behind him a wasted desert, whilst he transported into <GPE>Persia</GPE> the people and the treasures of the provinces.
 (145) Boldness and success of <PERSON>Odenathus</PERSON> against <LOC>Sapor</LOC> At the time when the <LOC>East</LOC> trembled at the name of Sapor, he received a present not unworthy of the greatest kings; a long train of camels laden with the most rare and valuable merchandises.
 The rich offering was accompanied with an epistle, respectful but not servile, from Odenathus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the noblest and most opulent senators of Palmyra.
 The desperate extremity to which the <PERSON>Palmyrenian</PERSON> was reduced called into action all the latent powers of his soul.
 He met Sapor; but he met him in arms.
 Infusing his own spirit into a little army collected from the villages of <GPE>Syria</GPE> (147) and the tents of the desert, (148) he hovered round the <NORP>Persian</NORP> host, harassed their retreat, carried off part of the treasure, and, what was dearer than any treasure, several of the women of the Great King; who was at last obliged to repass the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> with some marks of haste and confusion.
 (149) By this exploit, <PERSON>Odenathus</PERSON> laid the foundations of his future fame and fortunes.
 The majesty of Rome, oppressed by a Persian, was protected by a <NORP>Syrian</NORP> or <NORP>Arab</NORP> of Palmyra.
 Treatment of <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> The voice of history, which is often little more than the organ of hatred or flattery, reproaches <LOC>Sapor</LOC> with a proud abuse of the rights of conquest.
 We are told that Valerian, in chains, but invested with the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> purple, was exposed to the multitude, a constant spectacle of fallen greatness; and that whenever the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch mounted on horseback, he placed his foot on the neck of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 Notwithstanding all the remonstrances of his allies, who repeatedly advised him to remember the vicissitude of fortune, to dread the returning power of Rome, and to make his illustrious captive the pledge of peace, not the object of insult, <LOC>Sapor</LOC> still remained inflexible.
 When <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> sunk under the weight of shame and grief, his skin, stuffed with straw, and formed into the likeness of a human figure, was preserved for ages in the most celebrated temple of Persia; a more real monument of triumph than the fancied trophies of brass and marble so often erected by <NORP>Roman</NORP> vanity.
 (150) The tale is moral and pathetic, but the truth of it may very fairly be called in question.
 The letters still extant from the princes of the <LOC>East</LOC> to <LOC>Sapor</LOC> are manifest forgeries; (151) nor is it natural to suppose that a jealous monarch should, even in the person of a rival, thus publicly degrade the majesty of kings.
 Whatever treatment the unfortunate <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> might experience in Persia, it is at least certain that the only emperor of <GPE>Rome</GPE> who had ever fallen into the hands of the enemy languished away his life in hopeless captivity.
 Character and administration of <PERSON>Gallienus</PERSON> The emperor Gallienus, who had long supported with impatience the censorial severity of his father and colleague, received the intelligence of his misfortunes with secret pleasure and avowed indifference.
 Whilst <GPE>Rome</GPE> lamented the fate of her sovereign, the savage coldness of his son was extolled by the servile courtiers as the perfect firmness of a hero and a stoic.
 (152) It is difficult to paint the light, the various, the inconstant character of Gallienus, which he displayed without constraint, as soon as he became sole possessor of the empire.
 In every art that he attempted his lively genius enabled him to succeed; and as his genius was destitute of judgment, he attempted every art except the important ones of war and government.
 He was a master of several curious but useless.
 sciences, a ready orator and elegant poet, (153) a skilful gardener, an excellent cook, and most contemptible prince.
 When the great emergencies of the state required his presence and attention, he was engaged in conversation with the philosopher Plotinus, (154) wasting his time in trifling or licentious pleasures, preparing his initiation to the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> mysteries, or soliciting a place in the <PERSON>Areopagus</PERSON> of Athens.
 His profuse magnificence insulted the general poverty; the solemn ridicule of his triumphs impressed a deeper sense of the public disgrace.
 (155) The repeated intelligence of invasions, defeats, and rebellions, he received with a careless smile; and singling out, with affected contempt, some particular production of the lost province, he carelessly asked whether <GPE>Rome</GPE> must be ruined unless it was supplied with linen from <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and <GPE>Arras</GPE> cloth from Gaul? There were, however, a few short moments in the life of <PERSON>Gallienus</PERSON> when, exasperated by some recent injury, he suddenly appeared the intrepid soldier and the cruel tyrant; till satiated with blood, or fatigued by resistance, he insensibly sunk into the natural mildness and indolence of his character.
 (156) The <CARDINAL>30</CARDINAL> tyrants At a time when the reins of government were held with so loose a hand, it is not surprising that a crowd of usurpers should start up in very province of the empire against the son of Valerian.
 It was probably some ingenious fancy, of comparing the <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> tyrants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> with the <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> tyrants of Athens, that induced the writers of the Augustan History to select that celebrated number, which has been gradually received into a popular appellation.
 (157) But in every light the parallel is idle and defective.
 What resemblance can we discover between a council of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> persons, the united oppressors of a single city, and an uncertain list of independent rivals, who rose and fell in irregular succession through the extent of a vast empire? Nor can the number of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> be completed, unless we include in the account the women and children who were honoured with the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> title.
 Their real number was no more than <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> The reign of Gallienus, distracted as it was, produced only <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> pretenders to the throne;Cyriades, Macrianus, Balista, Odenathus, and <PERSON>Zenobia</PERSON> in the East; in Gaul, and the western provinces, Posthumus, Lollianus, <PERSON>Victorinus</PERSON> and his mother Victoria, Marius, and Tetricus.
 In <GPE>Illyricum</GPE> and the confines of the Danube, Ingenuus, Regillianus, and Aureolus; in Pontus, (158) Saturninus; in Isauria, Trebellianus; <PERSON>Piso</PERSON> in Thessaly; <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> in Achaia; <GPE>Aemilianus</GPE> in Egypt; and <GPE>Celsus</GPE> in Africa.
 To illustrate the obscure monuments of the life and death of each individual would prove a laborious task, alike barren of instruction and of amusement.
 We may content ourselves with investigating some general characters that most strongly mark the condition of the times and the manners of the men, their pretensions, their motives, their fate, and the destructive consequences of their usurpation.
 (159) Character and merit of the tyrants It is sufficiently known that the odious appellation of <PERSON>Tyrant</PERSON> was often employed by the ancients to express the illegal seizure of supreme power, without any reference to the abuse of it.
 Several of the pretenders, who raised the standard of rebellion against the emperor Gallienus, were shining models of virtue, and almost all possessed a considerable share of vigour and ability.
 Their merit had recommended them to the favour of Valerian, and gradually promoted them to the most important commands of the empire.
 The generals, who assumed the title of Augustus, were either respected by their troops for their able conduct and severe discipline, or admired for valour and success in war, or beloved for frankness and generosity.
 The field of victory was often the scene of their election; and even the armourer Marius, the most contemptible of all the candidates for the purple, was distinguished however by intrepid courage, matchless strength, and blunt honesty.
 (160)Their obscure birth His mean and recent trade cast indeed an air of ridicule on his elevation; but his birth could not be more obscure than wasthat of the greater part of his rivals, who were born of peasants and enlisted in the army as private soldiers.
 In times of confusion, every active genius finds the place assigned him by Nature: in a general state of war, military merit is the road to glory and to greatness.
 Of the <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Tetricus</PERSON> only was a senator; <PERSON>Piso</PERSON> alone was a noble.
 The blood of Numa, through <CARDINAL>twenty-eight</CARDINAL> successive generations, ran in the veins of Calphurnius Piso, (161) who, by female alliances, claimed a right of exhibiting, in his house, the images of <PERSON>Crassus</PERSON> and of the great Pompey.
 (162) His ancestors had been repeatedly dignified with all the honours which the commonwealth could bestow; and of all the ancient families of <GPE>Rome</GPE> the <NORP>Calphurnian</NORP> alone had survived the tyranny of the Caesars.
 The personal qualities of <PERSON>Piso</PERSON> added new lustre to his race.
 The usurper Valens, by whose order he was killed, confessed, with deep remorse, that even an enemy ought to have respected the sanctity of <PERSON>Piso</PERSON> and although he died in arms against Gallienus, the senate, with the emperor's generous permission, decreed the triumphal ornaments to the memory of so virtuous a rebel.
 (163) The causes of their rebellion The lieutenants of <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> were grateful to the father, whom they esteemed.
 They disdained to serve the luxurious indolence of his unworthy son.
 The throne of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world was unsupported by any principle of loyalty; and treason against such a prince might easily be considered as patriotism to the state.
 Yet if we examine with candour the conduct of these usurpers, it will appear that they were much oftener driven into rebellion by their fears than urged to it by their ambition.
 They dreaded the cruel suspicions of Gallienus; they equally dreaded the capricious violence of their troops.
 If the dangerous favour of the army had imprudently declared them deserving of the purple, they were marked for sure destruction; and even prudence would counsel them to secure a short enjoyment of empire, and rather to try the fortune of war than to expect the hand of an executioner.
 When the clamour of the soldiers invested the reluctant victims with the ensigns of sovereign authority, they sometimes mourned in secret their approaching fate.
 Their violent deaths The apprehensions of <PERSON>Saturninus</PERSON> were justified by the repeated experience of revolutions.
 Of the <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> tyrants who started up under the reign of Gallienus, there was not <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> who enjoyed a life of peace or a natural death.
 As soon as they were invested with the bloody purple, they inspired their adherents with the same fears and ambition which had occasioned their own revolt.
 Encompassed with domestic conspiracy, military sedition, and civil war, they trembled on the edge of precipices, in which, after a longer or shorter term of anxiety, they were inevitably lost.
 The precarious monarchs received, however, such honours as the flattery of their respective armies and provinces could bestow; but their claim, founded on rebellion, could never obtain the sanction of law or history.
 Italy, Rome, and the senate constantly adhered to the cause of Gallienus, and he alone was considered as the sovereign of the empire.
 That prince condescended indeed to acknowledge the victorious arms of Odenathus, who deserved the honourable distinction, by the respectful conduct which he always maintained towards the son of Valerian.
 With the general applause of the Romans, and the consent of Gallienus, the senate conferred the title of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> on the brave <PERSON>Palmyrenian</PERSON> and seemed to intrust him with the government of the East, which he already possessed, in so independent a manner, that, like a private succession, he bequeathed it to his illustrious widow Zenobia.
 (165) Fatal consequences of these usurpation The rapid and perpetual transitions from the cottage to the throne and from the throne to the grave, might have amused an indifferent philosopher; were it possible for a philosopher to remain indifferent amidst the general calamities of human kind.
 The election of these precarious emperors, their power and their death, were equally destructive to their subjects and adherents.
 The price of their fatal elevation was instantly discharged to the troops, by an immense donative, drawn from the bowels of the exhausted people.
 However virtuous was their character, however pure their intentions, they found themselves reduced to the hard necessity of supporting their usurpation by frequent acts of rapine and cruelty.
 When they fell, they involved armies and provinces in their fall.
 There is still extant a most savage mandate from <PERSON>Gallienus</PERSON> to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his ministers, after the suppression of Ingenuus, who had assumed the purple in IIlyricum.
 Whilst the public forces of the state were dissipated in private quarrels, the defenceless provinces lay exposed to every invader.
 The bravest usurpers were compelled, by the perplexity of their situation, to conclude ignominious treaties with the common enemy, to purchase with oppressive tributes the neutrality or services of the barbarians, and to introduce hostile and independent nations into the heart of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarchy.
 (168)Such were the barbarians, and such the tyrants, who, under the reigns of <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> and Gallienus, dismembered the provinces, and reduced the empire to the lowest pitch of disgrace and ruin, from whence it seemed impossible that it should ever emerge.
 As far as the barrenness of materials would permit, we have attempted to trace, with order and perspicuity, the general events of that calamitous period.
 There still remain some particular facts; I.
 The disorders of Sicily; II.
 The tumults of Alexandria; and, III.
 The rebellion of the Isaurians, which may serve to reflect a strong light on the horrid picture.
 Disorders of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> I.
 Whenever numerous troops of banditti, multiplied by success and impunity, publicly defy, instead of eluding the justice of their country, we may safely infer that the excessive weakness of the government is felt and abused by the lowest ranks of the community.
 The situation of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> preserved it from the barbarians; nor could the disarmed province have supported an usurper.
 The sufferings of that once flourishing and still fertile island were inflicted by baser hands.
 A licentious crown of slaves and peasants reigned for a while over the plundered country, and renewed the memory of the servile wars of more ancient times.
 (169) Devastations, of which the husbandman was either the victim or the accomplice, must have ruined the agriculture of Sicily; and as the principal estates were the property of the opulent senators of Rome, who often enclosed within a farm the territory of an old republic, it is not improbable that this private injury might affect the capital more deeply than all the conquests of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> or the Persians.
 Tumults of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> II.
 The foundation of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> was a noble design, at once conceived and executed by he son of Philip.
 The beautiful and regular form of that great city, <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> only to <GPE>Rome</GPE> itself, comprehended a circumference of fifteen miles ; (170) it was peopled by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred thousand inhabitants, besides at least an equal number of slaves.
 (171) The lucrative trade of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> and <GPE>India</GPE> flowed through the port of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> to the capital and provinces of the empire.
 Idleness was unknown.
 Some were employed in blowing of glass, others in weaving of linen, others again manufacturing the papyrus.
 Either sex, and every age, was engaged in the pursuits of industry, nor did even the blind or the lame want occupations suited to their condition.
 (172) But the people of Alexandria, a various mixture of nations, united the vanity and inconstancy of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> with the superstition and obstinacy of the Egyptians.
 The most trifling occasion, a transient scarcity of flesh or lentils, the neglect of an accustomed salutation, a mistake of precedency in the public baths, or a religious dispute, (173) were at any time sufficient to kindle a sedition among that vast multitude, whose resentments were furious and implacable.
 (174) After the captivity of <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> and the insolence of his son had relaxed the authority of the laws, the <NORP>Alexandrians</NORP> abandoned themselves to the ungoverned rage of their passions, and their unhappy country was the theatre of a civil war, which continued (with a few short and suspicious truces) above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years.
 (175) All intercourse was cut off between the several quarters of the afflicted city, every street was polluted with blood, every building of strength converted into a citadel; nor did the tumults subside, till a considerable part of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> was irretrievably ruined.
 The spacious and magnificent district of Bruchion, with its palaces and museum, the residence of the kings and philosophers of Egypt, is described above a century afterwards as already reduced to its present state of dreary solitude.
 (176) Rebellion of the <NORP>Isaurians</NORP> III.
 The obscure rebellion of Trebellianus, who assumed the purple in Isauria, a petty province of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, was attended with strange and memorable consequences.
 The pageant of royalty was soon destroyed by an officer of Gallienus; but his followers, despairing of mercy, resolved to shake off their allegiance, not only to the emperor, but to the empire, and suddenly returned to the savage manners, from which they had never perfectly been reclaimed.
 Their craggy rocks, a branch of the wide extended Taurus, protected their inaccessible retreat.
 The tillage of some fertile valleys (177) supplied them with necessaries, and a habit of rapine with the luxuries of life.
 In the heart of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarchy, the <NORP>Isaurians</NORP> long continued a nation of wild barbarians.
 Succeeding princes, unable to reduce them to obedience either by arms or policy, were compelled to acknowledge their weakness by surrounding the hostile and independent spot with a strong chain of fortifications, (178) which often proved insufficient to restrain the incursions of these domestic foes.
 The Isaurians, gradually extending their territory to the sea-coast, subdued the western and mountainous part of Cilicia, formerly the nest of those daring pirates, against whom the republic had once been obliged to exert its utmost force, under the conduct of the great Pompey.
 (179) Famine and pestilence.
 Our habits of thinking so fondly connect the order of the universe with the fate of man, that this gloomy period of history has been decorated with inundations, earthquakes, uncommon meteors, preternatural darkness, and a crowd of prodigies fictitious or exaggerated.
 (180) But a long and general famine was a calamity of a more serious kind.
 It was the inevitable consequence of rapine and oppression, which extirpated the produce of the present, and the hope of future harvests.
 Famine is almost always followed by epidemical diseases, the effect of scanty and unwholesome food.
 Other causes must however have contributed to the furious plague, which, from the year <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and fifty to the year <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty-five, raged without interruption in every province, every city, and almost every family, of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
During some time five thousand persons died <DATE>daily</DATE> in Rome, and many towns, that had escaped the hands of the barbarians, were entirely depopulated.
 (181) Diminution of the human species We have the knowledge of a very curious circumstance, of some use perhaps in the melancholy calculation of human calamities.
 An exact register was kept at Alexandria, of all the citizens entitled to receive the distribution of corn.
 It was found that the ancient number of those comprised between the ages of forty and seventy had been equal to the whole sum of claimants, from fourteen to fourscore years of age, who remained alive after the reign of Gallienus.
 (182) Applying this authentic fact to the most correct tables of mortality, it evidently proves that above <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> the people of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> had perished; and could we venture to extend the analogy to the other provinces, we might suspect that war, pestilence, and famine had consumed, in a few years, the moiety of the human species.
 (183)
