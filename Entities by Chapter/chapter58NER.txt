D.
 1095-1099.
 About twenty years after the conquest of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> by the Turks, the holy sepulchre was visited by <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> the Hermit.
 a hermit of the name of Peter, a native of Amiens, in the province of <GPE>Picardy</GPE> (1) in France.
 His resentment and sympathy were excited by his own injuries and the oppression of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> name; he mingled his tears with those of the patriarch, and earnestly inquired, if no hopes of relief could be entertained from the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors of the East.
 The patriarch exposed the vices and weakness of the successors of Constantine.
 and <LOC>Europe</LOC> was obedient to the call of the hermit.
 The astonished patriarch dismissed him with epistles of credit and complaint; and no sooner did he land at Bari, than <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> hastened to kiss the feet of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 His stature was small, his appearance contemptible; but his eye was keen and lively; and he possessed that vehemence of speech, which seldom fails to impart the persuasion of the soul.
 (2) He was born of a gentleman's family, (for we must now adopt a modern idiom,) and his military service was under the neighbouring counts of Boulogne, the heroes of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade.
 But he soon relinquished the sword and the world; and if it be true, that his wife, however noble, was aged and ugly, he might withdraw, with the less reluctance, from her bed to a convent, and at length to a hermitage.
 In this austere solitude, his body was emaciated, his fancy was inflamed; whatever he wished, he believed; whatever he believed, he saw in dreams and revelations.
 From <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> the pilgrim returned an accomplished fanatic; but as he excelled in the popular madness of the times, Pope <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> received him as a prophet, applauded his glorious design, promised to support it in a general council, and encouraged him to proclaim the deliverance of the Holy Land.
 Invigorated by the approbation of the pontiff, his zealous missionary traversed.
 with speed and success, the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and France.
 His diet was abstemious, his prayers long and fervent, and the alms which he received with <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hand, he distributed with the other: his head was bare, his feet naked, his meagre body was wrapped in a coarse garment; he bore and displayed a weighty crucifix; and the ass on which he rode was sanctified, in the public eye, by the service of the man of God.
 He preached to innumerable crowds in the churches, the streets, and the highways: the hermit entered with equal confidence the palace and the cottage; and the people (for all was people) was impetuously moved by his call to repentance and arms.
 When he painted the sufferings of the natives and pilgrims of Palestine, every heart was melted to compassion; every breast glowed with indignation, when he challenged the warriors of the age to defend their brethren, and rescue their Saviour: his ignorance of art and language was compensated by sighs, and tears, and ejaculations; and <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> supplied the deficiency of reason by loud and frequent appeals to <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and his mother, to the saints and angels of paradise, with whom he had personally conversed.
 The most perfect orator of <GPE>Athens</GPE> might have envied the success of his eloquence; the rustic enthusiast inspired the passions which he felt, and <NORP>Christendom</NORP> expected with impatience the counsels and decrees of the supreme pontiff.
 <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> II.
 In the council of Placentia, A.
D.
 1095,March.
 The magnanimous spirit of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh had already embraced the design of arming <LOC>Europe</LOC> against Asia; the ardour of his zeal and ambition still breathes in his epistles: from either side of the Alps, fifty thousand <NORP>Catholics</NORP> had enlisted under the banner of St.
 Peter; (3) and his successor reveals his intention of marching at their head against the impious sectaries of Mahomet.
 But the glory or reproach of executing, though not in person, this holy enterprise, was reserved for <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the Second, (4) the most faithful of his disciples.
 He undertook the conquest of the East, whilst the larger portion of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was possessed and fortified by his rival <PERSON>Guibert</PERSON> of Ravenna, who contended with <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> for the name and honours of the pontificate.
 He attempted to unite the powers of the West, at a time when the princes were separated from the church, and the people from their princes, by the excommunication which himself and his predecessors had thundered against the emperor and the king of France.
 <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> the First, of France, supported with patience the censures which he had provoked by his scandalous life and adulterous marriage.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Fourth, of Germany, asserted the right of investitures, the prerogative of confirming his bishops by the delivery of the ring and crosier.
 But the emperor's party was crushed in <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and the Countess Mathilda; and the long quarrel had been recently envenomed by the revolt of his son <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> and the shame of his wife, (5) who, in the synods of <PERSON>Constance</PERSON> and Placentia, confessed the manifold prostitutions to which she had been exposed by a husband regardless of her honour and his own.
 (6) So popular was the cause of Urban, so weighty was his influence, that the council which he summoned at <GPE>Placentia</GPE> (7) was composed of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> bishops of Italy, France, Burgandy, Swabia, and Bavaria.
 Four thousand of the clergy, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand of the laity, attended this important meeting; and, as the most spacious cathedral would have been inadequate to the multitude, the session of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days was held in a plain adjacent to the city.
 The ambassadors of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> Comnenus, were introduced to plead the distress of their sovereign, and the danger of Constantinople, which was divided only by a narrow sea from the victorious Turks, the common enemies of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> name.
 In their suppliant address they flattered the pride of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes; and, appealing at once to their policy and religion, exhorted them to repel the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> on the confines of Asia, rather than to expect them in the heart of Europe.
 At the sad tale of the misery and perils of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> brethren, the assembly burst into tears; the most eager champions declared their readiness to march; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> ambassadors were dismissed with the assurance of a speedy and powerful succour.
 The relief of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was included in the larger and most distant project of the deliverance of Jerusalem; but the prudent <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> adjourned the final decision to a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> synod, which he proposed to celebrate in some city of <GPE>France</GPE> in the autumn of the same year.
 The short delay would propagate the flame of enthusiasm; and his firmest hope was in a nation of soldiers (8) still proud of the preeminence of their name, and ambitious to emulate their hero Charlemagne, (9) who, in the popular romance of Turpin, (10) had achieved the conquest of the Holy Land.
 A latent motive of affection or vanity might influence the choice of Urban: he was himself a native of France, a monk of Clugny, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of his countrymen who ascended the throne of St.
 Peter.
 The pope had illustrated his family and province; nor is there perhaps a more exquisite gratification than to revisit, in a conspicuous dignity, the humble and laborious scenes of our youth.
 Council of Clermont, A.
D.
 1095,November.
 It may occasion some surprise that the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff should erect, in the heart of France, the tribunal from whence he hurled his anathemas against the king; but our surprise will vanish so soon as we form a just estimate of a king of <GPE>France</GPE> of the eleventh century.
 (11) <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> was the great-grandson of <PERSON>Hugh</PERSON> Capet, the founder of the present race, who, in the decline of Charlemagne's posterity, added the regal title to his patrimonial estates of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and Orleans.
 In this narrow compass, he was possessed of wealth and jurisdiction; but in the rest of France, <PERSON>Hugh</PERSON> and his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> descendants were no more than the feudal lords of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> dukes and counts, of independent and hereditary power, (12) who disdained the control of laws and legal assemblies, and whose disregard of their sovereign was revenged by the disobedience of their inferior vassals.
 At Clermont, in the territories of the count of Auvergne, (13) the pope might brave with impunity the resentment of Philip; and the council which he convened in that city was not less numerous or respectable than the synod of Placentia.
 (14) Besides his court and council of <NORP>Roman</NORP> cardinals, he was supported by <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> archbishops and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty-five bishops: the number of mitred prelates was computed at <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred; and the fathers of the church were blessed by the saints and enlightened by the doctors of the age.
 From the adjacent kingdoms, a martial train of lords and knights of power and renown attended the council, (15) in high expectation of its resolves; and such was the ardour of zeal and curiosity, that the city was filled, and many thousands, in the month of November, erected their tents or huts in the open field.
 A session of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> days produced some useful or edifying canons for the reformation of manners; a severe censure was pronounced against the license of private war; the Truce of God (16) was confirmed, a suspension of hostilities during <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> days of the week; women and priests were placed under the safeguard of the church; and a protection of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years was extended to husbandmen and merchants, the defenceless victims of military rapine.
 But a law, however venerable be the sanction, cannot suddenly transform the temper of the times; and the benevolent efforts of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> deserve the less praise, since he labored to appease some domestic quarrels that he might spread the flames of war from the <LOC>Atlantic</LOC> to the Euphrates.
 From the synod of Placentia, the rumour of his great design had gone forth among the nations: the clergy on their return had preached in every diocese the merit and glory of the deliverance of the Holy Land; and when the pope ascended a lofty scaffold in the market-place of Clermont, his eloquence was addressed to a well-prepared and impatient audience.
 His topics were obvious, his exhortation was vehement, his success inevitable.
 The orator was interrupted by the shout of thousands, who with <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> voice, and in their rustic idiom, exclaimed aloud, "God wills it, God wills it.
" (17) The proposal was joyfully accepted; great numbers, both of the clergy and laity, impressed on their garments the sign of the cross, (18) and solicited the pope to march at their head.
 This dangerous honour was declined by the more prudent successor of Gregory, who alleged the schism of the church, and the duties of his pastoral office, recommending to the faithful, who were disqualified by sex or profession, by age or infirmity, to aid, with their prayers and alms, the personal service of their robust brethren.
 The name and powers of his legate he devolved on <PERSON>Adhemar</PERSON> bishop of Puy, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who had received the cross at his hands.
 The foremost of the temporal chiefs was <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> count of Thoulouse, whose ambassadors in the council excused the absence, and pledged the honour, of their master.
 After the confession and absolution of their sins, the champions of the cross were dismissed with a superfluous admonition to invite their countrymen and friends; and their departure for the Holy Land was fixed to the festival of the Assumption, the fifteenth of August, of the ensuing year.
 (19) Justice of the crusades? So familiar, and as it were so natural to man, is the practice of violence, that our indulgence allows the slightest provocation, the most disputable right, as a sufficient ground of national hostility.
 But the name and nature of a holy war demands a more rigorous scrutiny; nor can we hastily believe, that the servants of the Prince of Peace would unsheathe the sword of destruction, unless the motive were pure, the quarrel legitimate, and the necessity inevitable.
 The policy of an action may be determined from the tardy lessons of experience; but, before we act, our conscience should be satisfied of the justice and propriety of our enterprise.
 In the age of the crusades, the Christians, both of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, were persuaded of their lawfulness and merit; their arguments are clouded by the perpetual abuse of <WORK_OF_ART>Scripture</WORK_OF_ART> and rhetoric; but they seem to insist on the right of natural and religious defence, their peculiar title to the Holy Land, and the impiety of their <NORP>Pagan</NORP> and <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> foes.
 (20) I.
 The right of a just defence may fairly include our civil and spiritual allies: it depends on the existence of danger; and that danger must be estimated by the twofold consideration of the malice, and the power, of our enemies.
 A pernicious tenet has been imputed to the Mahometans, the duty of extirpating all other religions by the sword.
 This charge of ignorance and bigotry is refuted by the Koran, by the history of the <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> conquerors, and by their public and legal toleration of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But it cannot be denied, that the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> churches are depressed under their iron yoke; that, in peace and war, they assert a divine and indefeasible claim of universal empire; and that, in their orthodox creed, the unbelieving nations are continually threatened with the loss of religion or liberty.
 In the eleventh century, the victorious arms of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> presented a real and urgent apprehension of these losses.
 They had subdued, in less than <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, the kingdoms of Asia, as far as <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> and the Hellespont; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire tottered on the verge of destruction.
 Besides an honest sympathy for their brethren, the <NORP>Latins</NORP> had a right and interest in the support of Constantinople, the most important barrier of the West; and the privilege of defence must reach to prevent, as well as to repel, an impending assault.
 But this salutary purpose might have been accomplished by a moderate succour; and our calmer reason must disclaim the innumerable hosts, and remote operations, which overwhelmed <LOC>Asia</LOC> and depopulated Europe.
 II.
 <GPE>Palestine</GPE> could add nothing to the strength or safety of the Latins; and fanaticism alone could pretend to justify the conquest of that distant and narrow province.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> affirmed that their inalienable title to the promised land had been sealed by the blood of their divine Saviour; it was their right and duty to rescue their inheritance from the unjust possessors, who profaned his sepulchre, and oppressed the pilgrimage of his disciples.
 Vainly would it be alleged that the preeminence of Jerusalem, and the sanctity of Palestine, have been abolished with the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> law; that the God of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> is not a local deity, and that the recovery of <PERSON>Bethlem</PERSON> or Calvary, his cradle or his tomb, will not atone for the violation of the moral precepts of the gospel.
 Such arguments glance aside from the leaden shield of superstition; and the religious mind will not easily relinquish its hold on the sacred ground of mystery and miracle.
 III.
 But the holy wars which have been waged in every climate of the globe, from <GPE>Egypt</GPE> to Livonia, and from <GPE>Peru</GPE> to Hindostan, require the support of some more general and flexible tenet.
 It has been often supposed, and sometimes affirmed, that a difference of religion is a worthy cause of hostility; that obstinate unbelievers may be slain or subdued by the champions of the cross; and that grace is the sole fountain of dominion as well as of mercy.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years before the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade, the eastern and western provinces of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had been acquired about the same time, and in the same manner, by the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Arabia.
 Time and treaties had legitimated the conquest of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> Franks; but in the eyes of their subjects and neighbours, the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> princes were still tyrants and usurpers, who, by the arms of war or rebellion, might be lawfully driven from their unlawful possession.
 (21) Spiritual motives and indulgences.
 As the manners of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> were relaxed, their discipline of penance (22) was enforced; and with the multiplication of sins, the remedies were multiplied.
 In the primitive church, a voluntary and open confession prepared the work of atonement.
 In the middle ages, the bishops and priests interrogated the criminal; compelled him to account for his thoughts, words, and actions; and prescribed the terms of his reconciliation with God.
 But as this discretionary power might alternately be abused by indulgence and tyranny, a rule of discipline was framed, to inform and regulate the spiritual judges.
 This mode of legislation was invented by the Greeks; their penitentials (23) were translated, or imitated, in the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church; and, in the time of Charlemagne, the clergy of every diocese were provided with a code, which they prudently concealed from the knowledge of the vulgar.
 In this dangerous estimate of crimes and punishments, each case was supposed, each difference was remarked, by the experience or penetration of the monks; some sins are enumerated which innocence could not have suspected, and others which reason cannot believe; and the more ordinary offences of fornication and adultery, of perjury and sacrilege, of rapine and murder, were expiated by a penance, which, according to the various circumstances, was prolonged from <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> days to <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years.
 During this term of mortification, the patient was healed, the criminal was absolved, by a salutary regimen of fasts and prayers: the disorder of his dress was expressive of grief and remorse; and he humbly abstained from all the business and pleasure of social life.
 But the rigid execution of these laws would have depopulated the palace, the camp, and the city; the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of the <LOC>West</LOC> believed and trembled; but nature often rebelled against principle; and the magistrate labored without effect to enforce the jurisdiction of the priest.
 A literal accomplishment of penance was indeed impracticable: the guilt of adultery was multiplied by <DATE>daily</DATE> repetition; that of homicide might involve the massacre of a whole people; each act was separately numbered; and, in those times of anarchy and vice, a modest sinner might easily incur a debt of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years.
 His insolvency was relieved by a commutation, or indulgence: a year of penance was appreciated at twenty-six solidi (24) of silver, about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> pounds sterling, for the rich; at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> solidi, or <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> shillings, for the indigent: and these alms were soon appropriated to the use of the church, which derived, from the redemption of sins, an inexhaustible source of opulence and dominion.
 A debt of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, or <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, was enough to impoverish a plentiful fortune; the scarcity of gold and silver was supplied by the alienation of land; and the princely donations of <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> are expressly given for the remedy of their soul.
 It is a maxim of the civil law, that whosoever cannot pay with his purse, must pay with his body; and the practice of flagellation was adopted by the monks, a cheap, though painful equivalent.
 By a fantastic arithmetic, a year of penance was taxed at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand lashes; (25) and such was the skill and patience of a famous hermit, St.
 Dominic of the iron Cuirass, (26) that in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days he could discharge an entire century, by a whipping of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand stripes.
 His example was followed by many penitents of both sexes; and, as a vicarious sacrifice was accepted, a sturdy disciplinarian might expiate on his own back the sins of his benefactors.
 (27) These compensations of the purse and the person introduced, in the eleventh century, a more honourable mode of satisfaction.
 The merit of military service against the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Africa and <GPE>Spain</GPE> had been allowed by the predecessors of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the Second.
 In the council of Clermont, that pope proclaimed a plenary indulgence to those who should enlist under the banner of the cross; the absolution of all their sins, and a full receipt for all that might be due of canonical penance.
 (28) The cold philosophy of modern times is incapable of feeling the impression that was made on a sinful and fanatic world.
 At the voice of their pastor, the robber, the incendiary, the homicide, arose by <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> to redeem their souls, by repeating on the infidels the same deeds which they had exercised against their <NORP>Christian</NORP> brethren; and the terms of atonement were eagerly embraced by offenders of every rank and denomination.
 None were pure; none were exempt from the guilt and penalty of sin; and those who were the least amenable to the justice of God and the church were the best entitled to the temporal and eternal recompense of their pious courage.
 If they fell, the spirit of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy did not hesitate to adorn their tomb with the crown of martyrdom; (29) and should they survive, they could expect without impatience the delay and increase of their heavenly reward.
 They offered their blood to the Son of God, who had laid down his life for their salvation: they took up the cross, and entered with confidence into the way of the Lord.
 His providence would watch over their safety; perhaps his visible and miraculous power would smooth the difficulties of their holy enterprise.
 The cloud and pillar of <GPE>Jehovah</GPE> had marched before the <NORP>Israelites</NORP> into the promised land.
 Might not the <NORP>Christians</NORP> more reasonably hope that the rivers would open for their passage; that the walls of their strongest cities would fall at the sound of their trumpets; and that the sun would be arrested in his mid career, to allow them time for the destruction of the infidels? Temporal and carnal motives.
 Of the chiefs and soldiers who marched to the holy sepulchre, I will dare to affirm, that all were prompted by the spirit of enthusiasm; the belief of merit, the hope of reward, and the assurance of divine aid.
 But I am equally persuaded, that in many it was not the sole, that in some it was not the leading, principle of action.
 The use and abuse of religion are feeble to stem, they are strong and irresistible to impel, the stream of national manners.
 Against the private wars of the Barbarians, their bloody tournaments, licentious love, and judicial duels, the popes and synods might ineffectually thunder.
 It is a more easy task to provoke the metaphysical disputes of the Greeks, to drive into the cloister the victims of anarchy or despotism, to sanctify the patience of slaves and cowards, or to assume the merit of the humanity and benevolence of modern Christians.
 War and exercise were the reigning passions of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> or Latins; they were enjoined, as a penance, to gratify those passions, to visit distant lands, and to draw their swords against the nation of the East.
 Their victory, or even their attempt, would immortalize the names of the intrepid heroes of the cross; and the purest piety could not be insensible to the most splendid prospect of military glory.
 In the petty quarrels of Europe, they shed the blood of their friends and countrymen, for the acquisition perhaps of a castle or a village.
 They could march with alacrity against the distant and hostile nations who were devoted to their arms; their fancy already grasped the golden sceptres of Asia; and the conquest of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the <NORP>Normans</NORP> might exalt to royalty the hopes of the most private adventurer.
 Christendom, in her rudest state, must have yielded to the climate and cultivation of the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> countries; and their natural and artificial wealth had been magnified by the tales of pilgrims, and the gifts of an imperfect commerce.
 The vulgar, both the great and small, were taught to believe every wonder, of lands flowing with milk and honey, of mines and treasures, of gold and diamonds, of palaces of marble and jasper, and of odoriferous groves of cinnamon and frankincense.
 In this earthly paradise, each warrior depended on his sword to carve a plenteous and honourable establishment, which he measured only by the extent of his wishes.
 (30) Their vassals and soldiers trusted their fortunes to God and their master: the spoils of a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> emir might enrich the meanest follower of the camp; and the flavour of the wines, the beauty of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> women, (31) were temptations more adapted to the nature, than to the profession, of the champions of the cross.
 The love of freedom was a powerful incitement to the multitudes who were oppressed by feudal or ecclesiastical tyranny.
 Under this holy sign, the peasants and burghers, who were attached to the servitude of the glebe, might escape from a haughty lord, and transplant themselves and their families to a land of liberty.
 The monk might release himself from the discipline of his convent: the debtor might suspend the accumulation of usury, and the pursuit of his creditors; and outlaws and malefactors of every cast might continue to brave the laws and elude the punishment of their crimes.
 (32) Influence of example.
 These motives were potent and numerous: when we have singly computed their weight on the mind of each individual, we must add the infinite series, the multiplying powers, of example and fashion.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> proselytes became the warmest and most effectual missionaries of the cross: among their friends and countrymen they preached the duty, the merit, and the recompense, of their holy vow; and the most reluctant hearers were insensibly drawn within the whirlpool of persuasion and authority.
 The martial youths were fired by the reproach or suspicion of cowardice; the opportunity of visiting with an army the sepulchre of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was embraced by the old and infirm, by women and children, who consulted rather their zeal than their strength; and those who in the evening had derided the folly of their companions, were the most eager, the ensuing day, to tread in their footsteps.
 The ignorance, which magnified the hopes, diminished the perils, of the enterprise.
 Since the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> conquest, the paths of pilgrimage were obliterated; the chiefs themselves had an imperfect notion of the length of the way and the state of their enemies; and such was the stupidity of the people, that, at the sight of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> city or castle beyond the limits of their knowledge, they were ready to ask whether that was not the Jerusalem, the term and object of their labours.
 Yet the more prudent of the crusaders, who were not sure that they should be fed from heaven with a shower of quails or manna, provided themselves with those precious metals, which, in every country, are the representatives of every commodity.
 To defray, according to their rank, the expenses of the road, princes alienated their provinces, nobles their lands and castles, peasants their cattle and the instruments of husbandry.
 The value of property was depreciated by the eager competition of multitudes; while the price of arms and horses was raised to an exorbitant height by the wants and impatience of the buyers.
 (33) Those who remained at home, with sense and money, were enriched by the epidemical disease: the sovereigns acquired at a cheap rate the domains of their vassals; and the ecclesiastical purchasers completed the payment by the assurance of their prayers.
 The cross, which was commonly sewed on the garment, in cloth or silk, was inscribed by some zealots on their skin: a hot iron, or indelible liquor, was applied to perpetuate the mark; and a crafty monk, who showed the miraculous impression on his breast was repaid with the popular veneration and the richest benefices of Palestine.
 (34) Departure of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusaders, A.
D.
 1096, <DATE>March</DATE> and <DATE>May</DATE> etc.
 The fifteenth of August had been fixed in the council of <GPE>Clermont</GPE> for the departure of the pilgrims; but the day was anticipated by the thoughtless and needy crowd of plebeians, and I shall briefly despatch the calamities which they inflicted and suffered, before I enter on the more serious and successful enterprise of the chiefs.
 Early in the spring, from the confines of <GPE>France</GPE> and Lorraine, above <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> thousand of the populace of both sexes flocked round the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> missionary of the crusade, and pressed him with clamorous importunity to lead them to the holy sepulchre.
 The hermit, assuming the character, without the talents or authority, of a general, impelled or obeyed the forward impulse of his votaries along the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and Danube.
 Their wants and numbers soon compelled them to separate, and his lieutenant, Walter the Penniless, a valiant though needy soldier, conducted a van guard of pilgrims, whose condition may be determined from the proportion of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> horsemen to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand foot.
 The example and footsteps of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> were closely pursued by another fanatic, the monk Godescal, whose sermons had swept away <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> or twenty thousand peasants from the villages of Germany.
 Their rear was again pressed by a herd of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand, the most stupid and savage refuse of the people, who mingled with their devotion a brutal license of rapine, prostitution, and drunkenness.
 Some counts and gentlemen, at the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand horse, attended the motions of the multitude to partake in the spoil; but their genuine leaders (may we credit such folly?) were a goose and a goat, who were carried in the front, and to whom these worthy <NORP>Christians</NORP> ascribed an infusion of the divine spirit.
 (35) Of these, and of other bands of enthusiasts, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most easy warfare was against the Jews, the murderers of the Son of God.
 In the trading cities of the <FAC>Moselle</FAC> and the Rhine, their colonies were numerous and rich; and they enjoyed, under the protection of the emperor and the bishops, the free exercise of their religion.
 (36) At Verdun, Treves, Mentz, Spires, Worms, many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of that unhappy people were pillaged and massacred: (37) nor had they felt a more bloody stroke since the persecution of Hadrian.
 A remnant was saved by the firmness of their bishops, who accepted a feigned and transient conversion; but the more obstinate <NORP>Jews</NORP> opposed their fanaticism to the fanaticism of the Christians, barricaded their houses, and precipitating themselves, their families, and their wealth, into the rivers or the flames, disappointed the malice, or at least the avarice, of their implacable foes.
 Their destruction in <GPE>Hungary</GPE> and Asia, A.
D.
 1096.
 Between the frontiers of <GPE>Austria</GPE> and the seat of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> monarchy, the crusaders were compelled to traverse an interval of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles; the wild and desolate countries of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> (38) and Bulgaria.
 The soil is fruitful, and intersected with rivers; but it was then covered with morasses and forests, which spread to a boundless extent, whenever man has ceased to exercise his dominion over the earth.
 Both nations had imbibed the rudiments of Christianity; the <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> were ruled by their native princes; the <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> by a lieutenant of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; but, on the slightest provocation, their ferocious nature was rekindled, and ample provocation was afforded by the disorders of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> pilgrims Agriculture must have been unskilful and languid among a people, whose cities were built of reeds and timber, which were deserted in the summer season for the tents of hunters and shepherds.
 A scanty supply of provisions was rudely demanded, forcibly seized, and greedily consumed; and on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> quarrel, the crusaders gave a loose to indignation and revenge.
 But their ignorance of the country, of war, and of discipline, exposed them to every snare.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> praefect of <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> commanded a regular force; at the trumpet of the <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> king, the eighth or the <ORDINAL>tenth</ORDINAL> of his martial subjects bent their bows and mounted on horseback; their policy was insidious, and their retaliation on these pious robbers was unrelenting and bloody.
 (39) About a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the naked fugitives (and the hermit <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> was of the number) escaped to the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> mountains; and the emperor, who respected the pilgrimage and succour of the Latins, conducted them by secure and easy journeys to Constantinople, and advised them to await the arrival of their brethren.
 For a while they remembered their faults and losses; but no sooner were they revived by the hospitable entertainment, than their venom was again inflamed; they stung their benefactor, and neither gardens, nor palaces, nor churches, were safe from their depredations.
 For his own safety, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> allured them to pass over to the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> side of the Bosphorus; but their blind impetuosity soon urged them to desert the station which he had assigned, and to rush headlong against the Turks, who occupied the road to Jerusalem.
 The hermit, conscious of his shame, had withdrawn from the camp to Constantinople; and his lieutenant, Walter the Penniless, who was worthy of a better command, attempted without success to introduce some order and prudence among the herd of savages.
 They separated in quest of prey, and themselves fell an easy prey to the arts of the sultan.
 By a rumour that their foremost companions were rioting in the spoils of his capital, <PERSON>Soliman</PERSON> tempted the main body to descend into the plain of Nice: they were overwhelmed by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> arrows; and a pyramid of bones (40) informed their companions of the place of their defeat.
 Of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusaders, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand had already perished, before a single city was rescued from the infidels, before their graver and more noble brethren had completed the preparations of their enterprise.
 (41) The chiefs of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade.
 None of the great sovereigns of <LOC>Europe</LOC> embarked their persons in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fourth</ORDINAL> was not disposed to obey the summons of the pope: <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> of <GPE>France</GPE> was occupied by his pleasures; <PERSON>William</PERSON> <PERSON>Rufus</PERSON> of <GPE>England</GPE> by a recent conquest; the kings of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were engaged in a domestic war against the Moors; and the northern monarchs of Scotland, Denmark, (42) Sweden, and Poland, were yet strangers to the passions and interests of the South.
 The religious ardour was more strongly felt by the princes of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> order, who held an important place in the feudal system.
 Their situation will naturally cast under <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> distinct heads the review of their names and characters; but I may escape some needless repetition, by observing at once, that courage and the exercise of arms are the common attribute of these <NORP>Christian</NORP> adventurers.
 <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of Bouillon.
.
 I.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rank both in war and council is justly due to <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of Bouillon; and happy would it have been for the crusaders, if they had trusted themselves to the sole conduct of that accomplished hero, a worthy representative of Charlemagne, from whom he was descended in the female line.
 His father was of the noble race of the counts of Boulogne: Brabant, the lower province of Lorraine, (43) was the inheritance of his mother; and by the emperor's bounty he was himself invested with that ducal title, which has been improperly transferred to his lordship of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> in the Ardennes.
 (44) In the service of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Fourth, he bore the great standard of the empire, and pierced with his lance the breast of Rodolph, the rebel king: <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who ascended the walls of Rome; and his sickness, his vow, perhaps his remorse for bearing arms against the pope, confirmed an early resolution of visiting the holy sepulchre, not as a pilgrim, but a deliverer.
 His valour was matured by prudence and moderation; his piety, though blind, was sincere; and, in the tumult of a camp, he practised the real and fictitious virtues of a convent.
 Superior to the private factions of the chiefs, he reserved his enmity for the enemies of Christ; and though he gained a kingdom by the attempt, his pure and disinterested zeal was acknowledged by his rivals.
 <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> (45) was accompanied by his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers, by <PERSON>Eustace</PERSON> the elder, who had succeeded to the county of Boulogne, and by the younger, Baldwin, a character of more ambiguous virtue.
 The duke of Lorraine, was alike celebrated on either side of the Rhine: from his birth and education, he was equally conversant with the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Teutonic</NORP> languages: the barons of France, Germany, and Lorraine, assembled their vassals; and the confederate force that marched under his banner was composed of fourscore thousand foot and about ten thousand horse.
 <PERSON>Hugh</PERSON> of Vernadois, etc.
 II.
 In the parliament that was held at Paris, in the king's presence, about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months after the council of Clermont, Hugh, count of Vermandois, was the most conspicuous of the princes who assumed the cross.
 But the appellation of the Great was applied, not so much to his merit or possessions, (though neither were contemptible,) as to the royal birth of the brother of the king of France.
 (46) Robert, duke of Normandy, was the eldest son of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror; but on his father's death he was deprived of the kingdom of England, by his own indolence and the activity of his brother Rufus.
 The worth of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was degraded by an excessive levity and easiness of temper: his cheerfulness seduced him to the indulgence of pleasure; his profuse liberality impoverished the prince and people; his indiscriminate clemency multiplied the number of offenders; and the amiable qualities of a private man became the essential defects of a sovereign.
 For the trifling sum of ten thousand marks, he mortgaged <GPE>Normandy</GPE> during his absence to the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> usurper; (47) but his engagement and behaviour in the holy war announced in <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> a reformation of manners, and restored him in some degree to the public esteem.
 Another <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was count of Flanders, a royal province, which, in this century, gave <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> queens to the thrones of France, England, and Denmark: he was surnamed the Sword and <PERSON>Lance</PERSON> of the Christians; but in the exploits of a soldier he sometimes forgot the duties of a general.
 Stephen, count of Chartres, of Blois, and of Troyes, was <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the richest princes of the age; and the number of his castles has been compared to the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five days of the year.
 His mind was improved by literature; and, in the council of the chiefs, the eloquent <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> (48) was chosen to discharge the office of their president.
 These <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> were the principal leaders of the French, the Normans, and the pilgrims of the <NORP>British</NORP> isles: but the list of the barons who were possessed of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> towns would exceed, says a contemporary, the catalogue of the Trojan war.
 (49) <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> of Tholouse.
 III.
 In the south of France, the command was assumed by <PERSON>Adhemar</PERSON> bishop of Puy, the pope's legate, and by <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> count of St.
 Giles and <PERSON>Thoulouse</PERSON> who added the prouder titles of duke of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> and marquis of Provence.
 The former was a respectable prelate, alike qualified for this world and the next.
 The latter was a veteran warrior, who had fought against the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Spain, and who consecrated his declining age, not only to the deliverance, but to the perpetual service, of the holy sepulchre.
 His experience and riches gave him a strong ascendant in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> camp, whose distress he was often able, and sometimes willing, to relieve.
 But it was easier for him to extort the praise of the Infidels, than to preserve the love of his subjects and associates.
 His eminent qualities were clouded by a temper haughty, envious, and obstinate; and, though he resigned an ample patrimony for the cause of God, his piety, in the public opinion, was not exempt from avarice and ambition.
 (50) A mercantile, rather than a martial, spirit prevailed among his provincials, (51) a common name, which included the natives of <LOC>Auvergne</LOC> and Languedoc, (52) the vassals of the kingdom of <GPE>Burgundy</GPE> or Arles.
 From the adjacent frontier of <GPE>Spain</GPE> he drew a band of hardy adventurers; as he marched through Lombardy, a crowd of <NORP>Italians</NORP> flocked to his standard, and his united force consisted of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand horse and foot.
 If <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to enlist and the last to depart, the delay may be excused by the greatness of his preparation and the promise of an everlasting farewell.
 <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> and Tancred.
 IV.
 The name of Bohemond, the son of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, was already famous by his double victory over the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; but his father's will had reduced him to the principality of Tarentum, and the remembrance of his <NORP>Eastern</NORP> trophies, till he was awakened by the rumour and passage of the <NORP>French</NORP> pilgrims.
 It is in the person of this <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> chief that we may seek for the coolest policy and ambition, with a small allay of religious fanaticism.
 His conduct may justify a belief that he had secretly directed the design of the pope, which he affected to <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> with astonishment and zeal: at the siege of Amalphi, his example and discourse inflamed the passions of a confederate army; he instantly tore his garment to supply crosses for the numerous candidates, and prepared to visit <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> at the head of ten thousand horse and twenty thousand foot.
 Several princes of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> race accompanied this veteran general; and his cousin <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> (53) was the partner, rather than the servant, of the war.
 In the accomplished character of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> we discover all the virtues of a perfect knight, (54) the true spirit of chivalry, which inspired the generous sentiments and social offices of man far better than the base philosophy, or the baser religion, of the times.
 Chivalry.
 Between the age of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> and that of the crusades, a revolution had taken place among the Spaniards, the Normans, and the French, which was gradually extended to the rest of Europe.
 The service of the infantry was degraded to the plebeians; the cavalry formed the strength of the armies, and the honourable name of miles , or soldier, was confined to the gentlemen (55) who served on horseback, and were invested with the character of knighthood.
 The dukes and counts, who had usurped the rights of sovereignty, divided the provinces among their faithful barons: the barons distributed among their vassals the fiefs or benefices of their jurisdiction; and these military tenants, the peers of each other and of their lord, composed the noble or equestrian order, which disdained to conceive the peasant or burgher as of the same species with themselves.
 The dignity of their birth was preserved by pure and equal alliances; their sons alone, who could produce <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> quarters or lines of ancestry without spot or reproach, might legally pretend to the honour of knighthood; but a valiant plebeian was sometimes enriched and ennobled by the sword, and became the father of a new race.
 A single knight could impart, according to his judgment, the character which he received; and the warlike sovereigns of <LOC>Europe</LOC> derived more glory from this personal distinction than from the lustre of their diadem.
 This ceremony, of which some traces may be found in <NORP>Tacitus</NORP> and the woods of Germany, (56) was in its origin simple and profane; the candidate, after some previous trial, was invested with the sword and spurs; and his cheek or shoulder was touched with a slight blow, as an emblem of the last affront which it was lawful for him to endure.
 But superstition mingled in every public and private action of life: in the holy wars, it sanctified the profession of arms; and the order of chivalry was assimilated in its rights and privileges to the sacred orders of priesthood.
 The bath and white garment of the novice were an indecent copy of the regeneration of baptism: his sword, which he offered on the altar, was blessed by the ministers of religion: his solemn reception was preceded by fasts and vigils; and he was created a knight in the name of God, of St.
 George, and of St.
 Michael the archangel.
 He swore to accomplish the duties of his profession; and education, example, and the public opinion, were the inviolable guardians of his oath.
 As the champion of God and the ladies, (I blush to unite such discordant names,) he devoted himself to speak the truth; to maintain the right; to protect the distressed; to practise courtesy, a virtue less familiar to the ancients; to pursue the infidels; to despise the allurements of ease and safety; and to vindicate in every perilous adventure the honour of his character.
 The abuse of the same spirit provoked the illiterate knight to disdain the arts of industry and peace; to esteem himself the sole judge and avenger of his own injuries; and proudly to neglect the laws of civil society and military discipline.
 Yet the benefits of this institution, to refine the temper of Barbarians, and to infuse some principles of faith, justice, and humanity, were strongly felt, and have been often observed.
 The asperity of national prejudice was softened; and the community of religion and arms spread a similar colour and generous emulation over the face of Christendom.
 Abroad in enterprise and pilgrimage, at home in martial exercise, the warriors of every country were perpetually associated; and impartial taste must prefer a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> tournament to the <EVENT>Olympic</EVENT> games of classic antiquity.
 (57) Instead of the naked spectacles which corrupted the manners of the Greeks, and banished from the stadium the virgins and matrons, the pompous decoration of the lists was crowned with the presence of chaste and high-born beauty, from whose hands the conqueror received the prize of his dexterity and courage.
 The skill and strength that were exerted in wrestling and boxing bear a distant and doubtful relation to the merit of a soldier; but the tournaments, as they were invented in France, and eagerly adopted both in the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, presented a lively image of the business of the field.
 The single combats, the general skirmish, the defence of a pass, or castle, were rehearsed as in actual service; and the contest, both in real and mimic war, was decided by the superior management of the horse and lance.
 The lance was the proper and peculiar weapon of the knight: his horse was of a large and heavy breed; but this charger, till he was roused by the approaching danger, was usually led by an attendant, and he quietly rode a pad or palfrey of a more easy pace.
 His helmet and sword, his greaves and buckler, it would be superfluous to describe; but I may remark, that, at the period of the crusades, the armour was less ponderous than in later times; and that, instead of a massy cuirass, his breast was defended by a hauberk or coat of mail.
 When their long lances were fixed in the rest, the warriors furiously spurred their horses against the foe; and the light cavalry of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and <NORP>Arabs</NORP> could seldom stand against the direct and impetuous weight of their charge.
 Each knight was attended to the field by his faithful squire, a youth of equal birth and similar hopes; he was followed by his archers and men at arms, and four, or five, or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> soldiers were computed as the furniture of a complete lance .
 In the expeditions to the neighbouring kingdoms or the Holy Land, the duties of the feudal tenure no longer subsisted; the voluntary service of the knights and their followers were either prompted by zeal or attachment, or purchased with rewards and promises; and the numbers of each squadron were measured by the power, the wealth, and the fame, of each independent chieftain.
 They were distinguished by his banner, his armorial coat, and his cry of war; and the most ancient families of <LOC>Europe</LOC> must seek in these achievements the origin and proof of their nobility.
 In this rapid portrait of chivalry I have been urged to anticipate on the story of the crusades, at once an effect and a cause, of this memorable institution.
 (58) <DATE>March</DATE> of the princes to Constantinople, A.
D.
 1096, August 15-A.
D.
 1097, May.
 Such were the troops, and such the leaders, who assumed the cross for the deliverance of the holy sepulchre.
 As soon as they were relieved by the absence of the plebeian multitude, they encouraged each other, by interviews and messages, to accomplish their vow, and hasten their departure.
 Their wives and sisters were desirous of partaking the danger and merit of the pilgrimage: their portable treasures were conveyed in bars of silver and gold; and the princes and barons were attended by their equipage of hounds and hawks to amuse their leisure and to supply their table.
 The difficulty of procuring subsistence for so many myriads of men and horses engaged them to separate their forces: their choice or situation determined the road; and it was agreed to meet in the neighbourhood of Constantinople, and from thence to begin their operations against the Turks.
 From the banks of the <FAC>Meuse</FAC> and the Moselle, <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> followed the direct way of Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria; and, as long as he exercised the sole command every step afforded some proof of his prudence and virtue.
 On the confines of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> he was stopped <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> weeks by a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people, to whom the name, or at least the abuse, of the cross was justly odious.
 The <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> still smarted with the wounds which they had received from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> pilgrims: in their turn they had abused the right of defence and retaliation; and they had reason to apprehend a severe revenge from a hero of the same nation, and who was engaged in the same cause.
 But, after weighing the motives and the events, the virtuous duke was content to pity the crimes and misfortunes of his worthless brethren; and his <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> deputies, the messengers of peace, requested in his name a free passage and an equal market.
 To remove their suspicions, <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> trusted himself, and afterwards his brother, to the faith of Carloman, king of Hungary, who treated them with a simple but hospitable entertainment: the treaty was sanctified by their common gospel; and a proclamation, under pain of death, restrained the animosity and license of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> soldiers.
 From <GPE>Austria</GPE> to Belgrade, they traversed the plains of Hungary, without enduring or offering an injury; and the proximity of Carloman, who hovered on their flanks with his numerous cavalry, was a precaution not less useful for their safety than for his own.
 They reached the banks of the Save; and no sooner had they passed the river, than the king of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> restored the hostages, and saluted their departure with the fairest wishes for the success of their enterprise.
 With the same conduct and discipline, <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> pervaded the woods of <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> and the frontiers of Thrace; and might congratulate himself that he had almost reached the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> term of his pilgrimage, without drawing his sword against a <NORP>Christian</NORP> adversary.
 After an easy and pleasant journey through Lombardy, from <GPE>Turin</GPE> to Aquileia, <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> and his provincials marched <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> days through the savage country of <GPE>Dalmatia</GPE> (59) and Sclavonia.
 The weather was a perpetual fog; the land was mountainous and desolate; the natives were either fugitive or hostile: loose in their religion and government, they refused to furnish provisions or guides; murdered the stragglers; and exercised by <TIME>night</TIME> and day the vigilance of the count, who derived more security from the punishment of some captive robbers than from his interview and treaty with the prince of Scodra.
 (60) His march between <GPE>Durazzo</GPE> and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was harassed, without being stopped, by the peasants and soldiers of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; and the same faint and ambiguous hostility was prepared for the remaining chiefs, who passed the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> from the coast of Italy.
 <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> had arms and vessels, and foresight and discipline; and his name was not forgotten in the provinces of <GPE>Epirus</GPE> and Thessaly.
 Whatever obstacles he encountered were surmounted by his military conduct and the valour of Tancred; and if the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince affected to spare the Greeks, he gorged his soldiers with the full plunder of an heretical castle.
 (61) The nobles of <GPE>France</GPE> pressed forwards with the vain and thoughtless ardour of which their nation has been sometimes accused.
 From the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to <GPE>Apulia</GPE> the march of <PERSON>Hugh</PERSON> the Great, of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Roberts, and of <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> of Chartres, through a wealthy country, and amidst the applauding Catholics, was a devout or triumphant progress: they kissed the feet of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; and the golden standard of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> was delivered to the brother of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch.
 (62) But in this visit of piety and pleasure, they neglected to secure the season, and the means of their embarkation: the <DATE>winter</DATE> was insensibly lost: their troops were scattered and corrupted in the towns of Italy.
 They separately accomplished their passage, regardless of safety or dignity; and within <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> months from the feast of the Assumption, the day appointed by Urban, all the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes had reached Constantinople.
 But the count of <NORP>Vermandois</NORP> was produced as a captive; his foremost vessels were scattered by a tempest; and his person, against the law of nations, was detained by the lieutenants of Alexius.
 Yet the arrival of <PERSON>Hugh</PERSON> had been announced by <CARDINAL>four-and-twenty</CARDINAL> knights in golden armour, who commanded the emperor to revere the general of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians, the brother of the king of kings.
 (63) Policy of the emperor <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> Comnenus, A.
D.
 1096, December - A.
D.
 1097, May.
 In some oriental tale I have read the fable of a shepherd, who was ruined by the accomplishment of his own wishes: he had prayed for water; the <LOC>Ganges</LOC> was turned into his grounds, and his flock and cottage were swept away by the inundation.
 Such was the fortune, or at least the apprehension of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> Comnenus, whose name has already appeared in this history, and whose conduct is so differently represented by his daughter Anne, (64) and by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> writers.
 (65) In the council of Placentia, his ambassadors had solicited a moderate succour, perhaps of ten thousand soldiers, but he was astonished by the approach of so many potent chiefs and fanatic nations.
 The emperor fluctuated between hope and fear, between timidity and courage; but in the crooked policy which he mistook for wisdom, I cannot believe, I cannot discern, that he maliciously conspired against the life or honour of the <NORP>French</NORP> heroes.
 The promiscuous multitudes of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> the Hermit were savage beasts, alike destitute of humanity and reason: nor was it possible for <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> to prevent or deplore their destruction.
 The troops of <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> and his peers were less contemptible, but not less suspicious, to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 Their motives might be pure and pious: but he was equally alarmed by his knowledge of the ambitious Bohemond, and his ignorance of the <NORP>Transalpine</NORP> chiefs: the courage of the <NORP>French</NORP> was blind and headstrong; they might be tempted by the luxury and wealth of Greece, and elated by the view and opinion of their invincible strength: and <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> might be forgotten in the prospect of Constantinople.
 After a long march and painful abstinence, the troops of <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> encamped in the plains of Thrace; they heard with indignation, that their brother, the count of Vermandois, was imprisoned by the Greeks; and their reluctant duke was compelled to indulge them in some freedom of retaliation and rapine.
 They were appeased by the submission of Alexius: he promised to supply their camp; and as they refused, in the midst of winter, to pass the Bosphorus, their quarters were assigned among the gardens and palaces on the shores of that narrow sea.
 But an incurable jealousy still rankled in the minds of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, who despised each other as slaves and Barbarians.
 Ignorance is the ground of suspicion, and suspicion was inflamed into <DATE>daily</DATE> provocations: prejudice is blind, hunger is deaf; and <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> is accused of a design to starve or assault the <NORP>Latins</NORP> in a dangerous post, on all sides encompassed with the waters.
 (66) <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> sounded his trumpets, burst the net, overspread the plain, and insulted the suburbs; but the gates of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> were strongly fortified; the ramparts were lined with archers; and, after a doubtful conflict, both parties listened to the voice of peace and religion.
 The gifts and promises of the emperor insensibly soothed the fierce spirit of the western strangers; as a <NORP>Christian</NORP> warrior, he rekindled their zeal for the prosecution of their holy enterprise, which he engaged to <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> with his troops and treasures.
 On the return of spring, <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> was persuaded to occupy a pleasant and plentiful camp in Asia; and no sooner had he passed the Bosphorus, than the <NORP>Greek</NORP> vessels were suddenly recalled to the opposite shore.
 The same policy was repeated with the succeeding chiefs, who were swayed by the example, and weakened by the departure, of their foremost companions.
 By his skill and diligence, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> prevented the union of any <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of the confederate armies at the same moment under the walls of Constantinople; and before the feast of the <EVENT>Pentecost</EVENT> not a <NORP>Latin</NORP> pilgrim was left on the coast of Europe.
 He obtains the homage of the crusaders.
 The same arms which threatened <LOC>Europe</LOC> might deliver Asia, and repel the <NORP>Turks</NORP> from the neighbouring shores of the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> and Hellespont.
 The fair provinces from <GPE>Nice</GPE> to <GPE>Antioch</GPE> were the recent patrimony of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor; and his ancient and perpetual claim still embraced the kingdoms of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Egypt.
 In his enthusiasm, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> indulged, or affected, the ambitious hope of leading his new allies to subvert the thrones of the East; but the calmer dictates of reason and temper dissuaded him from exposing his royal person to the faith of unknown and lawless Barbarians.
 His prudence, or his pride, was content with extorting from the <NORP>French</NORP> princes an oath of homage and fidelity, and a solemn promise, that they would either restore, or hold, their <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> conquests as the humble and loyal vassals of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 Their independent spirit was fired at the mention of this foreign and voluntary servitude: they successively yielded to the dexterous application of gifts and flattery; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> proselytes became the most eloquent and effectual missionaries to multiply the companions of their shame.
 The pride of <PERSON>Hugh</PERSON> of <NORP>Vermandois</NORP> was soothed by the honours of his captivity; and in the brother of the <NORP>French</NORP> king, the example of submission was prevalent and weighty.
 In the mind of <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> every human consideration was subordinate to the glory of God and the success of the crusade.
 He had firmly resisted the temptations of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> and Raymond, who urged the attack and conquest of Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> esteemed his virtues, deservedly named him the champion of the empire, and dignified his homage with the filial name and the rights of adoption.
 (67) The hateful <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was received as a true and ancient ally; and if the emperor reminded him of former hostilities, it was only to praise the valour that he had displayed, and the glory that he had acquired, in the fields of <GPE>Durazzo</GPE> and Larissa.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was lodged and entertained, and served with <NORP>Imperial</NORP> pomp: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day, as he passed through the gallery of the palace, a door was carelessly left open to expose a pile of gold and silver, of silk and gems, of curious and costly furniture, that was heaped, in seeming disorder, from the floor to the roof of the chamber.
 — "It is your own," replied a <NORP>Greek</NORP> attendant, who watched the motions of his soul; and Bohemond, after some hesitation, condescended to accept this magnificent present.
 The <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> was flattered by the assurance of an independent principality; and <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> eluded, rather than denied, his daring demand of the office of great domestic, or general of the East.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Roberts, the son of the conqueror of England, and the kinsmen of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> queens, (68) bowed in their turn before the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne.
 A private letter of <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> of <PERSON>Chartres</PERSON> attests his admiration of the emperor, the most excellent and liberal of men, who taught him to believe that he was a favourite, and promised to educate and establish his youngest son.
 In his southern province, the count of St.
 Giles and <PERSON>Thoulouse</PERSON> faintly recognized the supremacy of the king of France, a prince of a foreign nation and language.
 At the head of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand men, he declared that he was the soldier and servant of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> alone, and that the <NORP>Greek</NORP> might be satisfied with an equal treaty of alliance and friendship.
 His obstinate resistance enhanced the value and the price of his submission; and he shone, says the princess Anne, among the Barbarians, as the sun amidst the stars of heaven.
 His disgust of the noise and insolence of the French, his suspicions of the designs of Bohemond, the emperor imparted to his faithful Raymond; and that aged statesman might clearly discern, that however false in friendship, he was sincere in his enmity.
 (69) The spirit of chivalry was last subdued in the person of Tancred; and none could deem themselves dishonoured by the imitation of that gallant knight.
 He disdained the gold and flattery of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; assaulted in his presence an insolent patrician; escaped to <LOC>Asia</LOC> in the habit of a private soldier; and yielded with a sigh to the authority of Bohemond, and the interest of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> cause.
 The best and most ostensible reason was the impossibility of passing the sea and accomplishing their vow, without the license and the vessels of Alexius; but they cherished a secret hope, that as soon as they trod the continent of Asia, their swords would obliterate their shame, and dissolve the engagement, which on his side might not be very faithfully performed.
 The ceremony of their homage was grateful to a people who had long since considered pride as the substitute of power.
 High on his throne, the emperor sat mute and immovable: his majesty was adored by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes; and they submitted to kiss either his feet or his knees, an indignity which their own writers are ashamed to confess and unable to deny.
 (70) Insolence of the Franks.
 Private or public interest suppressed the murmurs of the dukes and counts; but a <NORP>French</NORP> baron (he is supposed to be <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> of <GPE>Paris</GPE> (71)) presumed to ascend the throne, and to place himself by the side of Alexius.
 The sage reproof of <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> provoked him to exclaim, in his barbarous idiom, The emperor maintained his silence, dissembled his indignation, and questioned his interpreter concerning the meaning of the words, which he partly suspected from the universal language of gesture and countenance.
 Before the departure of the pilgrims, he endeavoured to learn the name and condition of the audacious baron.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> dismissed the challenger with some prudent advice for his conduct in the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> warfare; and history repeats with pleasure this lively example of the manners of his age and country.
 Their review and numbers,A.
D.
 1097, May.
 The conquest of <LOC>Asia</LOC> was undertaken and achieved by Alexander, with thirty-five thousand <NORP>Macedonians</NORP> and Greeks; (73) and his best hope was in the strength and discipline of his phalanx of infantry.
 The principal force of the crusaders consisted in their cavalry; and when that force was mustered in the plains of Bithynia, the knights and their martial attendants on horseback amounted to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand fighting men, completely armed with the helmet and coat of mail.
 The value of these soldiers deserved a strict and authentic account; and the flower of <NORP>European</NORP> chivalry might furnish, in a <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> effort, this formidable body of heavy horse.
 A part of the infantry might be enrolled for the service of scouts, pioneers, and archers; but the promiscuous crowd were lost in their own disorder; and we depend not on the eyes and knowledge, but on the belief and fancy, of a chaplain of Count Baldwin, (74) in the estimate of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand pilgrims able to bear arms, besides the priests and monks, the women and children of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> camp.
 The reader starts; and before he is recovered from his surprise, I shall add, on the same testimony, that if all who took the cross had accomplished their vow, above SIX MILLIONS would have migrated from <LOC>Europe</LOC> to Asia.
 Under this oppression of faith, I derive some relief from a more sagacious and thinking writer, (75) who, after the same review of the cavalry, accuses the credulity of the priest of Chartres, and even doubts whether the <NORP>Cisalpine</NORP> regions (in the geography of a Frenchman) were sufficient to produce and pour forth such incredible multitudes.
 The coolest scepticism will remember, that of these religious volunteers great numbers never beheld <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Nice.
 Of enthusiasm the influence is irregular and transient: many were detained at home by reason or cowardice, by poverty or weakness; and many were repulsed by the obstacles of the way, the more insuperable as they were unforeseen, to these ignorant fanatics.
 The savage countries of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> and <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> were whitened with their bones: their vanguard was cut in pieces by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan; and the loss of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> adventure, by the sword, or climate, or fatigue, has already been stated at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 Yet the myriads that survived, that marched, that pressed forwards on the holy pilgrimage, were a subject of astonishment to themselves and to the Greeks.
 The copious energy of her language sinks under the efforts of the princess Anne: (76) the images of locusts, of leaves and flowers, of the sands of the sea, or the stars of heaven, imperfectly represent what she had seen and heard; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> exclaims, that <LOC>Europe</LOC> was loosened from its foundations, and hurled against Asia.
 The ancient hosts of <PERSON>Darius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> labour under the same doubt of a vague and indefinite magnitude; but I am inclined to believe, that a larger number has never been contained within the lines of a single camp, than at the siege of Nice, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> operation of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes.
 Their motives, their characters, and their arms, have been already displayed.
 Of their troops the most numerous portion were natives of France: the Low Countries, the banks of the Rhine, and Apulia, sent a powerful reinforcement: some bands of adventurers were drawn from Spain, Lombardy, and England; (77) and from the distant bogs and mountains of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> or <GPE>Scotland</GPE> (78) issued some naked and savage fanatics, ferocious at home but unwarlike abroad.
 Had not superstition condemned the sacrilegious prudence of depriving the poorest or weakest <NORP>Christian</NORP> of the merit of the pilgrimage, the useless crowd, with mouths but without hands, might have been stationed in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire, till their companions had opened and secured the way of the Lord.
 A small remnant of the pilgrims, who passed the Bosphorus, was permitted to visit the holy sepulchre.
 Their northern constitution was scorched by the rays, and infected by the vapours, of a <NORP>Syrian</NORP> sun.
 They consumed, with heedless prodigality, their stores of water and provision: their numbers exhausted the inland country: the sea was remote, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were unfriendly, and the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of every sect fled before the voracious and cruel rapine of their brethren.
 In the dire necessity of famine, they sometimes roasted and devoured the flesh of their infant or adult captives.
 Among the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Saracens, the idolaters of <LOC>Europe</LOC> were rendered more odious by the name and reputation of Cannibals; the spies, who introduced themselves into the kitchen of Bohemond, were shown several human bodies turning on the spit: and the artful <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> encouraged a report, which increased at the same time the abhorrence and the terror of the infidels.
 (79) Siege of Nice, A.
D.
 1097,May 14-June 20.
 I have expiated with pleasure on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the crusaders, as they paint the manners and character of Europe: but I shall abridge the tedious and uniform narrative of their blind achievements, which were performed by strength and are described by ignorance.
 From their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> station in the neighbourhood of Nicomedia, they advanced in successive divisions; passed the contracted limit of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire; opened a road through the hills, and commenced, by the siege of his capital, their pious warfare against the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan.
 His kingdom of <GPE>Roum</GPE> extended from the <NORP>Hellespont</NORP> to the confines of Syria, and barred the pilgrimage of Jerusalem, his name was Kilidge-Arslan, or Soliman, (80) of the race of Seljuk, and son of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conqueror; and in the defence of a land which the <NORP>Turks</NORP> considered as their own, he deserved the praise of his enemies, by whom alone he is known to posterity.
 Yielding to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> impulse of the torrent, he deposited his family and treasure in Nice; retired to the mountains with fifty thousand horse; and twice descended to assault the camps or quarters of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> besiegers, which formed an imperfect circle of above <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> miles.
 The lofty and solid walls of <GPE>Nice</GPE> were covered by a deep ditch, and flanked by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> towers; and on the verge of Christendom, the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were trained in arms, and inflamed by religion.
 Before this city, the <NORP>French</NORP> princes occupied their stations, and prosecuted their attacks without correspondence or subordination: emulation prompted their valour; but their valour was sullied by cruelty, and their emulation degenerated into envy and civil discord.
 In the siege of Nice, the arts and engines of antiquity were employed by the Latins; the mine and the battering-ram, the tortoise, and the belfrey or movable turret, artificial fire, and the catapult and balist, the sling, and the crossbow for the casting of stones and darts.
 (81) In the space of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> weeks much labour and blood were expended, and some progress, especially by Count Raymond, was made on the side of the besiegers.
 But the <NORP>Turks</NORP> could protract their resistance and secure their escape, as long as they were masters of the Lake (82) Ascanius, which stretches several miles to the westward of the city.
 The means of conquest were supplied by the prudence and industry of Alexius; a great number of boats was transported on sledges from the sea to the lake; they were filled with the most dexterous of his archers; the flight of the sultana was intercepted; <GPE>Nice</GPE> was invested by land and water; and a <NORP>Greek</NORP> emissary persuaded the inhabitants to accept his master's protection, and to save themselves, by a timely surrender, from the rage of the savages of Europe.
 In the moment of victory, or at least of hope, the crusaders, thirsting for blood and plunder, were awed by the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> banner that streamed from the citadel; and <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> guarded with jealous vigilance this important conquest.
 The murmurs of the chiefs were stifled by honour or interest; and after a halt of <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> days, they directed their march towards <GPE>Phrygia</GPE> under the guidance of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> general, whom they suspected of a secret connivance with the sultan.
 The consort and the principal servants of <PERSON>Soliman</PERSON> had been honourably restored without ransom; and the emperor's generosity to the miscreants (83) was interpreted as treason to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> cause.
 Battle of Dorylaeum, A.
D.
 1097, July 4.
 <PERSON>Soliman</PERSON> was rather provoked than dismayed by the loss of his capital: he admonished his subjects and allies of this strange invasion of the Western Barbarians; the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> emirs obeyed the call of loyalty or religion; the <NORP>Turkman</NORP> hordes encamped round his standard; and his whole force is loosely stated by the <NORP>Christians</NORP> at <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred, or even <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> thousand horse.
 Yet he patiently waited till they had left behind them the sea and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> frontier; and hovering on the flanks, observed their careless and confident progress in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns beyond the view of each other.
 Some miles before they could reach <PERSON>Dorylaeum</PERSON> in Phrygia, the left, and least numerous, division was surprised, and attacked, and almost oppressed, by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> cavalry.
 (84) The heat of the weather, the clouds of arrows, and the barbarous onset, overwhelmed the crusaders; they lost their order and confidence, and the fainting fight was sustained by the personal valour, rather than by the military conduct, of Bohemond, Tancred, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> of Normandy.
 They were revived by the welcome banners of Duke Godfrey, who flew to their succour, with the count of Vermandois, and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> thousand horse; and was followed by <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> of Tholouse, the bishop of Puy, and the remainder of the sacred army.
 Without a moment's pause, they formed in new order, and advanced to a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> battle.
 They were received with equal resolution; and, in their common disdain for the unwarlike people of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia, it was confessed on both sides, that the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and the <NORP>Franks</NORP> were the only nations entitled to the appellation of soldiers.
 (85) Their encounter was varied, and balanced by the contrast of arms and discipline; of the direct charge, and wheeling evolutions; of the couched lance, and the brandished javelin; of a weighty broadsword, and a crooked sabre; of cumbrous armour, and thin flowing robes; and of the long <NORP>Tartar</NORP> bow, and the arbalist or crossbow, a deadly weapon, yet unknown to the Orientals.
 (86) As long as the horses were fresh, and the quivers full, <PERSON>Soliman</PERSON> maintained the advantage of the day; and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Christians</NORP> were pierced by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> arrows.
 In the evening, swiftness yielded to strength: on either side, the numbers were equal or at least as great as any ground could hold, or any generals could manage; but in turning the hills, the last division of <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> and his provincials was led, perhaps without design on the rear of an exhausted enemy; and the long contest was determined.
 Besides a nameless and unaccounted multitude, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Pagan</NORP> knights were slain in the battle and pursuit; the camp of <PERSON>Soliman</PERSON> was pillaged; and in the variety of precious spoil, the curiosity of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> was amused with foreign arms and apparel, and the new aspect of dromedaries and camels.
 The importance of the victory was proved by the hasty retreat of the sultan: reserving ten thousand guards of the relics of his army, <PERSON>Soliman</PERSON> evacuated the kingdom of Roum, and hastened to implore the aid, and kindle the resentment, of his <NORP>Eastern</NORP> brethren.
 <DATE>March</DATE> through the lesser Asia, July-September.
 In a march of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles, the crusaders traversed the Lesser Asia, through a wasted land and deserted towns, without finding either a friend or an enemy.
 The geographer (87) may trace the position of Dorylaeum, <GPE>Antioch</GPE> of Pisidia, Iconium, Archelais, and Germanicia, and may compare those classic appellations with the modern names of <NORP>Eskishehr</NORP> the old city, <NORP>Akshehr</NORP> the white city, Cogni, Erekli, and Marash.
 As the pilgrims passed over a desert, where a draught of water is exchanged for silver, they were tormented by intolerable thirst; and on the banks of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rivulet, their haste and intemperance were still more pernicious to the disorderly throng.
 They climbed with toil and danger the steep and slippery sides of Mount Taurus; many of the soldiers cast away their arms to secure their footsteps; and had not terror preceded their van, the long and trembling file might have been driven down the precipice by a handful of resolute enemies.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> of their most respectable chiefs, the duke of <PERSON>Lorraine</PERSON> and the count of Tholouse, were carried in litters: <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> was raised, as it is said by miracle, from a hopeless malady; and <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> had been torn by a bear, as he pursued that rough and perilous chase in the mountains of Pisidia.
 <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> founds the principality of Edessa, A.
D.
 1097-1151.
 To improve the general consternation, the cousin of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> and the brother of <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> were detached from the main army with their respective squadrons of five, and of seven, <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> knights.
 They overran in a rapid career the hills and sea-coast of Cilicia, from <GPE>Cogni</GPE> to the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> gates: the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> standard was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> planted on the walls of <GPE>Tarsus</GPE> and Malmistra; but the proud injustice of <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> at length provoked the patient and generous Italian; and they turned their consecrated swords against each other in a private and profane quarrel.
 Honour was the motive, and fame the reward, of Tancred; but fortune smiled on the more selfish enterprise of his rival.
 (88) He was called to the assistance of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> or <NORP>Armenian</NORP> tyrant, who had been suffered under the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> yoke to reign over the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of Edessa.
 <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> accepted the character of his son and champion: but no sooner was he introduced into the city, than he inflamed the people to the massacre of his father, occupied the throne and treasure, extended his conquests over the hills of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and the plain of Mesopotamia, and founded the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> principality of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> or Latins, which subsisted fifty-four years beyond the Euphrates.
 (89) <PERSON>Seige</PERSON> of Antioch, A.
D.
 1097, October 21- A.
D.
 1098, June 3.
.
 Before the <NORP>Franks</NORP> could enter Syria, the summer, and even the autumn, were completely wasted: the siege of Antioch, or the separation and repose of the army during the <DATE>winter</DATE> season, was strongly debated in their council: the love of arms and the holy sepulchre urged them to advance; and reason perhaps was on the side of resolution, since every hour of delay abates the fame and force of the invader, and multiplies the resources of defensive war.
 The capital of <GPE>Syria</GPE> was protected by the River Orontes; and the iron bridge, of <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> arches, derives its name from the massy gates of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> towers which are constructed at either end.
 They were opened by the sword of the duke of Normandy: his victory gave entrance to <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand crusaders, an account which may allow some scope for losses and desertion, but which clearly detects much exaggeration in the review of Nice.
 In the description of Antioch, (90) it is not easy to define a middle term between her ancient magnificence, under the successors of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> and Augustus, and the modern aspect of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> desolation.
 The Tetrapolis, or <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> cities, if they retained their name and position, must have left a large vacuity in a circumference of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles; and that measure, as well as the number of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> towers, are not perfectly consistent with the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> gates, so often mentioned in the history of the siege.
 Yet <GPE>Antioch</GPE> must have still flourished as a great and populous capital.
 At the head of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> emirs, Baghisian, a veteran chief, commanded in the place: his garrison was composed of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> or twenty thousand foot: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Moslems</NORP> are said to have fallen by the sword; and their numbers were probably inferior to the Greeks, Armenians, and Syrians, who had been no more than <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> years the slaves of the house of Seljuk.
 From the remains of a solid and stately wall, it appears to have arisen to the height of threescore feet in the valleys; and wherever less art and labour had been applied, the ground was supposed to be defended by the river, the morass, and the mountains.
 Notwithstanding these fortifications, the city had been repeatedly taken by the Persians, the Arabs, the Greeks, and the Turks; so large a circuit must have yielded many pervious points of attack; and in a siege that was formed about the middle of October, the vigour of the execution could alone justify the boldness of the attempt.
 Whatever strength and valour could perform in the field was abundantly discharged by the champions of the cross: in the frequent occasions of sallies, of forage, of the attack and defence of convoys, they were often victorious; and we can only complain, that their exploits are sometimes enlarged beyond the scale of probability and truth.
 The sword of <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> (91) divided a <PERSON>Turk</PERSON> from the shoulder to the haunch; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> half of the infidel fell to the ground, while the other was transported by his horse to the city gate.
 As <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> of <GPE>Normandy</GPE> rode against his antagonist, and that head was instantly cloven to the breast by the resistless stroke of his descending falchion.
 But the reality or the report of such gigantic prowess (92) must have taught the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> to keep within their walls: and against those walls of earth or stone, the sword and the lance were unavailing weapons.
 In the slow and successive labours of a siege, the crusaders were supine and ignorant, without skill to contrive, or money to purchase, or industry to use, the artificial engines and implements of assault.
 In the conquest of Nice, they had been powerfully assisted by the wealth and knowledge of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor: his absence was poorly supplied by some <NORP>Genoese</NORP> and <NORP>Pisan</NORP> vessels, that were attracted by religion or trade to the coast of Syria: the stores were scanty, the return precarious, and the communication difficult and dangerous.
 Indolence or weakness had prevented the <NORP>Franks</NORP> from investing the entire circuit; and the perpetual freedom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> gates relieved the wants and recruited the garrison of the city.
 At the end of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months, after the ruin of their cavalry, and an enormous loss by famine, desertion and fatigue, the progress of the crusaders was imperceptible, and their success remote, if the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Ulysses, the artful and ambitious Bohemond, had not employed the arms of cunning and deceit.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> were numerous and discontented: Phirouz, a <NORP>Syrian</NORP> renegade, had acquired the favour of the emir and the command of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> towers; and the merit of his repentance disguised to the Latins, and perhaps to himself, the foul design of perfidy and treason.
 A secret correspondence, for their mutual interest, was soon established between <PERSON>Phirouz</PERSON> and the prince of Tarento; and <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> declared in the council of the chiefs, that he could deliver the city into their hands.
 But he claimed the sovereignty of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> as the reward of his service; and the proposal which had been rejected by the envy, was at length extorted from the distress, of his equals.
 The nocturnal surprise was executed by the <NORP>French</NORP> and <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes, who ascended in person the scaling-ladders that were thrown from the walls: their new proselyte, after the murder of his too scrupulous brother, embraced and introduced the servants of Christ; the army rushed through the gates; and the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> soon found, that although mercy was hopeless, resistance was impotent.
 But the citadel still refused to surrender; and the victims themselves were speedily encompassed and besieged by the innumerable forces of Kerboga, prince of Mosul, who, with <CARDINAL>twenty-eight</CARDINAL> <NORP>Turkish</NORP> emirs, advanced to the deliverance of Antioch.
 Five-and-twenty days the <NORP>Christians</NORP> spent on the verge of destruction; and the proud lieutenant of the caliph and the sultan left them only the choice of servitude or death.
 (93) Victory of the crusaders, A.
D.
 1098, June 28.
 In this extremity they collected the relics of their strength, sallied from the town, and in a single memorable day, annihilated or dispersed the host of <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Arabians, which they might safely report to have consisted of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 (94) Their supernatural allies I shall proceed to consider: the human causes of the victory of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> were the fearless despair of the Franks; and the surprise, the discord, perhaps the errors, of their unskilful and presumptuous adversaries.
 The battle is described with as much disorder as it was fought; but we may observe the tent of Kerboga, a movable and spacious palace, enriched with the luxury of Asia, and capable of holding above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand persons; we may distinguish his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand guards, who were cased, the horse as well as the men, in complete steel.
 Their famine and distress at Antioch.
 In the eventful period of the siege and defence of Antioch, the crusaders were alternately exalted by victory or sunk in despair; either swelled with plenty or emaciated with hunger.
 A speculative reasoner might suppose, that their faith had a strong and serious influence on their practice; and that the soldiers of the cross, the deliverers of the holy sepulchre, prepared themselves by a sober and virtuous life for the <DATE>daily</DATE> contemplation of martyrdom.
 Experience blows away this charitable illusion; and seldom does the history of profane war display such scenes of intemperance and prostitution as were exhibited under the walls of Antioch.
 The grove of <PERSON>Daphne</PERSON> no longer flourished; but the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> air was still impregnated with the same vices; the <NORP>Christians</NORP> were seduced by every temptation (95) that nature either prompts or reprobates; the authority of the chiefs was despised; and sermons and edicts were alike fruitless against those scandalous disorders, not less pernicious to military discipline, than repugnant to evangelic purity.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the siege and the possession of Antioch, the <NORP>Franks</NORP> consumed with wanton and thoughtless prodigality the frugal subsistence of weeks and months: the desolate country no longer yielded a supply; and from that country they were at length excluded by the arms of the besieging Turks.
 Disease, the faithful companion of want, was envenomed by the rains of the winter, the summer heats, unwholesome food, and the close imprisonment of multitudes.
 The pictures of famine and pestilence are always the same, and always disgustful; and our imagination may suggest the nature of their sufferings and their resources.
 The remains of treasure or spoil were eagerly lavished in the purchase of the vilest nourishment; and dreadful must have been the calamities of the poor, since, after paying <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> marks of silver for a goat and <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> for a lean camel, (96) the count of <GPE>Flanders</GPE> was reduced to beg a dinner, and Duke <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> to borrow a horse.
 Sixty thousand horse had been reviewed in the camp: before the end of the siege they were diminished to <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand, and scarcely <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> fit for service could be mustered on the day of battle.
 Weakness of body and terror of mind extinguished the ardent enthusiasm of the pilgrims; and every motive of honour and religion was subdued by the desire of life.
 (97) Among the chiefs, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> heroes may be found without fear or reproach: <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> was supported by his magnanimous piety; <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> by ambition and interest; and <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> declared, in the true spirit of chivalry, that as long as he was at the head of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> knights, he would never relinquish the enterprise of Palestine.
 But the count of <GPE>Tholouse</GPE> and <GPE>Provence</GPE> was suspected of a voluntary indisposition; the duke of <GPE>Normandy</GPE> was recalled from the sea-shore by the censures of the church: <PERSON>Hugh</PERSON> the Great, though he led the vanguard of the battle, embraced an ambiguous opportunity of returning to <GPE>France</GPE> and Stephen, count of Chartres, basely deserted the standard which he bore, and the council in which he presided.
 The soldiers were discouraged by the flight of William, viscount of Melun, surnamed the Carpenter, from the weighty strokes of his axe; and the saints were scandalized by the fall of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> the Hermit, who, after arming <LOC>Europe</LOC> against Asia, attempted to escape from the penance of a necessary fast.
 Of the multitude of recreant warriors, the names (says an historian) are blotted from the book of life; and the opprobrious epithet of the rope-dancers was applied to the deserters who dropped in the <TIME>night</TIME> from the walls of Antioch.
 The emperor Alexius, (98) who seemed to advance to the succour of the Latins, was dismayed by the assurance of their hopeless condition.
 They expected their fate in silent despair; oaths and punishments were tried without effect; and to rouse the soldiers to the defence of the walls, it was found necessary to set fire to their quarters.
 Legend of the Holy Lance.
 For their salvation and victory, they were indebted to the same fanaticism which had led them to the brink of ruin.
 In such a cause, and in such an army, visions, prophecies, and miracles, were frequent and familiar.
 In the distress of Antioch, they were repeated with unusual energy and success: St.
 Ambrose had assured a pious ecclesiastic, that <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years of trial must precede the season of deliverance and grace; the deserters were stopped by the presence and reproaches of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> himself; the dead had promised to arise and combat with their brethren; the <PERSON>Virgin</PERSON> had obtained the pardon of their sins; and their confidence was revived by a visible sign, the seasonable and splendid discovery of the HOLY LANCE.
 The policy of their chiefs has on this occasion been admired, and might surely be excused; but a pious baud is seldom produced by the cool conspiracy of many persons; and a voluntary impostor might depend on the support of the wise and the credulity of the people.
 Of the diocese of Marseilles, there was a priest of low cunning and loose manners, and his name was <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> Bartholemy.
 He presented himself at the door of the council-chamber, to disclose an apparition of St.
 Andrew, which had been thrice reiterated in his sleep with a dreadful menace, if he presumed to suppress the commands of Heaven.
 The pope's legate, the bishop of Puy, affected to listen with coldness and distrust; but the revelation was eagerly accepted by Count Raymond, whom his faithful subject, in the name of the apostle, had chosen for the guardian of the holy lance.
 The experiment was resolved; and on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day after a due preparation of prayer and fasting, the priest of <GPE>Marseilles</GPE> introduced <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> trusty spectators, among whom were the count and his chaplain; and the church doors were barred against the impetuous multitude.
 The ground was opened in the appointed place; but the workmen, who relieved each other, dug to the depth of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> feet without discovering the object of their search.
 In the evening, when Count <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> had withdrawn to his post, and the weary assistants began to murmur, Bartholemy, in his shirt, and without his shoes, boldly descended into the pit; the darkness of the hour and of the place enabled him to secrete and deposit the head of a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> lance; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> sound, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gleam, of the steel was saluted with a devout rapture.
 The holy lance was drawn from its recess, wrapped in a veil of silk and gold, and exposed to the veneration of the crusaders; their anxious suspense burst forth in a general shout of joy and hope, and the desponding troops were again inflamed with the enthusiasm of valour.
 Whatever had been the arts, and whatever might be the sentiments of the chiefs, they skilfully improved this fortunate revolution by every aid that discipline and devotion could afford.
 The soldiers were dismissed to their quarters with an injunction to fortify their minds and bodies for the approaching conflict, freely to bestow their last pittance on themselves and their horses, and to expect with the dawn of day the signal of victory.
 On the festival of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and St.
 Paul, the gates of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> were thrown open: a martial psalm, "Let the Lord arise, and let his enemies be scattered!" was chanted by a procession of priests and monks; the battle array was marshalled in <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> divisions, in honour of the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> apostles; and the holy lance, in the absence of Raymond, was entrusted to the hands of his chaplain.
 The influence of his relic or trophy, was felt by the servants, and perhaps by the enemies, of Christ; (99) and its potent energy was heightened by an accident, a stratagem, or a rumour, of a miraculous complexion.
 Celestial warriors.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> knights, in white garments and resplendent arms, either issued, or seemed to issue, from the hills: the voice of Adhemar, the pope's legate, proclaimed them as the martyrs St.
 George, St.
 Theodore, and St.
 Maurice: the tumult of battle allowed no time for doubt or scrutiny; and the welcome apparition dazzled the eyes or the imagination of a fanatic army.
 In the season of danger and triumph, the revelation of <PERSON>Bartholemy</PERSON> of <GPE>Marseilles</GPE> was unanimously asserted; but as soon as the temporary service was accomplished, the personal dignity and liberal arms which the count of <GPE>Tholouse</GPE> derived from the custody of the holy lance, provoked the envy, and awakened the reason, of his rivals.
 A <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> clerk presumed to sift, with a philosophic spirit, the truth of the legend, the circumstances of the discovery, and the character of the prophet; and the pious <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> ascribed their deliverance to the merits and intercession of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> alone.
 For a while, the <NORP>Provincials</NORP> defended their national palladium with clamours and arms and new visions condemned to death and hell the profane sceptics who presumed to scrutinize the truth and merit of the discovery.
 The prevalence of incredulity compelled the author to submit his life and veracity to the judgment of God.
 A pile of dry faggots, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> feet high and <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> long, was erected in the midst of the camp; the flames burnt fiercely to the elevation of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> cubits; and a narrow path of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> inches was left for the perilous trial.
 The unfortunate priest of <GPE>Marseilles</GPE> traversed the fire with dexterity and speed; but the thighs and belly were scorched by the intense heat; he expired the next day; and the logic of believing minds will pay some regard to his dying protestations of innocence and truth.
 Some efforts were made by the <NORP>Provincials</NORP> to substitute a cross, a ring, or a tabernacle, in the place of the holy lance, which soon vanished in contempt and oblivion.
 (100) Yet the revelation of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> is gravely asserted by succeeding historians: and such is the progress of credulity, that miracles most doubtful on the spot, and at the moment, will be received with implicit faith at a convenient distance of time and space.
 The state of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and caliphs of Egypt.
 The prudence or fortune of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> had delayed their invasion till the decline of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> empire.
 (101) Under the manly government of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> sultans, the kingdoms of <LOC>Asia</LOC> were united in peace and justice; and the innumerable armies which they led in person were equal in courage, and superior in discipline, to the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of the West.
 But at the time of the crusade, the inheritance of Malek Shaw was disputed by his <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> sons; their private ambition was insensible of the public danger; and, in the vicissitudes of their fortune, the royal vassals were ignorant, or regardless, of the true object of their allegiance.
 The <CARDINAL>twenty-eight</CARDINAL> emirs who marched with the standard or <ORG>Kerboga</ORG> were his rivals or enemies: their hasty levies were drawn from the towns and tents of <GPE>Mesopotamia</GPE> and Syria; and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> veterans were employed or consumed in the civil wars beyond the Tigris.
 The caliph of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> embraced this opportunity of weakness and discord to recover his ancient possessions; and his sultan <PERSON>Aphdal</PERSON> besieged <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> and Tyre, expelled the children of Ortok, and restored in <GPE>Palestine</GPE> the civil and ecclesiastical authority of the Fatimites.
 (102) They heard with astonishment of the vast armies of <NORP>Christians</NORP> that had passed from <LOC>Europe</LOC> to Asia, and rejoiced in the sieges and battles which broke the power of the Turks, the adversaries of their sect and monarchy.
 But the same <NORP>Christians</NORP> were the enemies of the prophet; and from the overthrow of <GPE>Nice</GPE> and Antioch, the motive of their enterprise, which was gradually understood, would urge them forwards to the banks of the Jordan, or perhaps of the Nile.
 An intercourse of epistles and embassies, which rose and fell with the events of war, was maintained between the throne of <GPE>Cairo</GPE> and the camp of the Latins; and their adverse pride was the result of ignorance and enthusiasm.
 The ministers of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> declared in a haughty, or insinuated in a milder, tone, that their sovereign, the true and lawful commander of the faithful, had rescued <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> from the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> yoke; and that the pilgrims, if they would divide their numbers, and lay aside their arms, should find a safe and hospitable reception at the sepulchre of Jesus.
 In the belief of their lost condition, the caliph <PERSON>Mostali</PERSON> despised their arms and imprisoned their deputies: the conquest and victory of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> prompted him to solicit those formidable champions with gifts of horses and silk robes, of vases, and purses of gold and silver; and in his estimate of their merit or power, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> place was assigned to Bohemond, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> to Godfrey.
 In either fortune, the answer of the crusaders was firm and uniform: they disdained to inquire into the private claims or possessions of the followers of Mahomet; whatsoever was his name or nation, the usurper of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> was their enemy; and instead of prescribing the mode and terms of their pilgrimage, it was only by a timely surrender of the city and province, their sacred right, that he could deserve their alliance, or deprecate their impending and irresistible attack.
 (103) Delay of the Franks, A.
D.
 1098, July- A.
D.
 1099, May.
 Yet this attack, when they were within the view and reach of their glorious prize, was suspended above ten months after the defeat of Kerboga.
 The zeal and courage of the crusaders were chilled in the moment of victory; and instead of marching to improve the consternation, they hastily dispersed to enjoy the luxury, of Syria.
 The causes of this strange delay may be found in the want of strength and subordination.
 In the painful and various service of Antioch, the cavalry was annihilated; many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of every rank had been lost by famine, sickness, and desertion: the same abuse of plenty had been productive of a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> famine; and the alternative of intemperance and distress had generated a pestilence, which swept away above fifty thousand of the pilgrims.
 Few were able to command, and none were willing to obey; the domestic feuds, which had been stifled by common fear, were again renewed in acts, or at least in sentiments, of hostility; the fortune of <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> excited the envy of their companions; the bravest knights were enlisted for the defence of their new principalities; and Count <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> exhausted his troops and treasures in an idle expedition into the heart of Syria.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> was consumed in discord and disorder; a sense of honour and religion was rekindled in the spring; and the private soldiers, less susceptible of ambition and jealousy, awakened with angry clamours the indolence of their chiefs.
 Their march to Jerusalem, A.
D.
 1099, <DATE>May</DATE> 13-June 6.
 In the month of May, the relics of this mighty host proceeded from <GPE>Antioch</GPE> to Laodicea: about <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> thousand Latins, of whom no more than <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horse, and twenty thousand foot, were capable of immediate service.
 Their easy march was continued between Mount Libanus and the sea-shore: their wants were liberally supplied by the coasting traders of <GPE>Genoa</GPE> and Pisa; and they drew large contributions from the emirs of Tripoli, Tyre, Sidon, Acre, and Caesarea, who granted a free passage, and promised to follow the example of Jerusalem.
 From <GPE>Caesarea</GPE> they advanced into the midland country; their clerks recognized the sacred geography of Lydda, Ramla, Emmaus, and Bethlem, and as soon as they descried the holy city, the crusaders forgot their toils and claimed their reward.
 (104) <PERSON>Seige</PERSON> and conquest of Jerusalem, A.
D.
 1099, June 7 - July 15.
 <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> has derived some reputation from the number and importance of her memorable sieges.
 It was not till after a long and obstinate contest that <GPE>Babylon</GPE> and <GPE>Rome</GPE> could prevail against the obstinacy of the people, the craggy ground that might supersede the necessity of fortifications, and the walls and towers that would have fortified the most accessible plain.
 (105) These obstacles were diminished in the age of the crusades.
 The bulwarks had been completely destroyed and imperfectly restored: the Jews, their nation, and worship, were forever banished; but nature is less changeable than man, and the site of Jerusalem, though somewhat softened and somewhat removed, was still strong against the assaults of an enemy.
 By the experience of a recent siege, and a <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years' possession, the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> had been taught to discern, and in some degree to remedy, the defects of a place, which religion as well as honour forbade them to resign.
 Aladin, or Iftikhar, the caliph's lieutenant, was entrusted with the defence: his policy strove to restrain the native <NORP>Christians</NORP> by the dread of their own ruin and that of the holy sepulchre; to animate the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> by the assurance of temporal and eternal rewards.
 His garrison is said to have consisted of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Arabians; and if he could muster twenty thousand of the inhabitants, it must be confessed that the besieged were more numerous than the besieging army.
 (106) Had the diminished strength and numbers of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> allowed them to grasp the whole circumference of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand yards, (about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> miles and a half, (107)) to what useful purpose should they have descended into the valley of Ben Hinnom and torrent of Cedron, (108) or approach the precipices of the south and east, from whence they had nothing either to hope or fear? Their siege was more reasonably directed against the northern and western sides of the city.
 <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> erected his standard on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> swell of Mount Calvary: to the left, as far as St.
 Stephen's gate, the line of attack was continued by <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Roberts; and Count <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> established his quarters from the citadel to the foot of Mount Sion, which was no longer included within the precincts of the city.
 On the fifth day, the crusaders made a general assault, in the fanatic hope of battering down the walls without engines, and of scaling them without ladders.
 By the dint of brutal force, they burst the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> barrier; but they were driven back with shame and slaughter to the camp: the influence of vision and prophecy was deadened by the too frequent abuse of those pious stratagems; and time and labour were found to be the only means of victory.
 The time of the siege was indeed fulfilled in <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> days, but they were <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> days of calamity and anguish.
 A repetition of the old complaint of famine may be imputed in some degree to the voracious or disorderly appetite of the Franks; but the stony soil of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> is almost destitute of water; the scanty springs and hasty torrents were dry in the summer season; nor was the thirst of the besiegers relieved, as in the city, by the artificial supply of cisterns and aqueducts.
 The circumjacent country is equally destitute of trees for the uses of shade or building, but some large beams were discovered in a cave by the crusaders: a wood near Sichem, the enchanted grove of Tasso, (109) was cut down: the necessary timber was transported to the camp by the vigour and dexterity of Tancred; and the engines were framed by some <NORP>Genoese</NORP> artists, who had fortunately landed in the harbour of Jaffa.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> movable turrets were constructed at the expense, and in the stations, of the duke of <PERSON>Lorraine</PERSON> and the count of Tholouse, and rolled forwards with devout labour, not to the most accessible, but to the most neglected, parts of the fortification.
 Raymond's Tower was reduced to ashes by the fire of the besieged, but his colleague was more vigilant and successful; the enemies were driven by his archers from the rampart; the draw-bridge was let down; and on a Friday, at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> in the afternoon, the day and hour of the passion, <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> stood victorious on the walls of Jerusalem.
 His example was followed on every side by the emulation of valour; and about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> years after the conquest of Omar, the holy city was rescued from the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> yoke.
 In the pillage of public and private wealth, the adventurers had agreed to respect the exclusive property of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> occupant; and the spoils of the great mosque, <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> lamps and massy vases of gold and silver, rewarded the diligence, and displayed the generosity, of Tancred.
 A bloody sacrifice was offered by his mistaken votaries to the God of the Christians: resistance might provoke but neither age nor sex could mollify, their implacable rage: they indulged themselves <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in a promiscuous massacre; (110) and the infection of the dead bodies produced an epidemical disease.
 After <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Moslems</NORP> had been put to the sword, and the harmless <NORP>Jews</NORP> had been burnt in their synagogue, they could still reserve a multitude of captives, whom interest or lassitude persuaded them to spare.
 Of these savage heroes of the cross, <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> alone betrayed some sentiments of compassion; yet we may praise the more selfish lenity of Raymond, who granted a capitulation and safe-conduct to the garrison of the citadel.
 (111) The holy sepulchre was now free; and the bloody victors prepared to accomplish their vow.
 Bareheaded and barefoot, with contrite hearts, and in an humble posture, they ascended the hill of Calvary, amidst the loud anthems of the clergy; kissed the stone which had covered the Saviour of the world; and bedewed with tears of joy and penitence the monument of their redemption.
 This union of the fiercest and most tender passions has been variously considered by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> philosophers; by the one, (112) as easy and natural; by the other, (113) as absurd and incredible.
 Perhaps it is too rigorously applied to the same persons and the same hour; the example of the virtuous <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> awakened the piety of his companions; while they cleansed their bodies, they purified their minds; nor shall I believe that the most ardent in slaughter and rapine were the foremost in the procession to the holy sepulchre.
 Election and reign of <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of Bouillon, A.
D.
 1099, July 23-A.
D.
 1100, July 18.
 Eight days after this memorable event, which Pope <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> did not live to hear, the <NORP>Latin</NORP> chiefs proceeded to the election of a king, to guard and govern their conquests in Palestine.
 <PERSON>Hugh</PERSON> the Great, and <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> of Chartres, had retired with some loss of reputation, which they strove to regain by a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> crusade and an honourable death.
 <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> was established at Edessa, and <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> at Antioch; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Roberts, the duke of <GPE>Normandy</GPE> (114) and the count of Flanders, preferred their fair inheritance in the <LOC>West</LOC> to a doubtful competition or a barren sceptre.
 The jealousy and ambition of <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> were condemned by his own followers, and the free, the just, the unanimous voice of the army proclaimed <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most worthy of the champions of Christendom.
 His magnanimity accepted a trust as full of danger as of glory; but in a city where his Saviour had been crowned with thorns, the devout pilgrim rejected the name and ensigns of royalty; and the founder of the kingdom of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> contented himself with the modest title of Defender and Baron of the Holy Sepulchre.
 His government of a single year, (115) too short for the public happiness, was interrupted in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fortnight by a summons to the field, by the approach of the vizier or sultan of Egypt, who had been too slow to prevent, but who was impatient to avenge, the loss of Jerusalem.
 Battle of Ascalon, A.
D.
 1099, August 12.
 His total overthrow in the battle of <GPE>Ascalon</GPE> sealed the establishment of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> in Syria, and signalized the valour of the <NORP>French</NORP> princes who in this action bade a long farewell to the holy wars.
 Some glory might be derived from the prodigious inequality of numbers, though I shall not count the myriads of horse and foot on the side of the Fatimites; but, except <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Ethiopians</NORP> or Blacks, who were armed with flails or scourges of iron, the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of the <LOC>South</LOC> fled on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, and afforded a pleasing comparison between the active valour of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and the sloth and effeminacy of the natives of Egypt.
 After suspending before the holy sepulchre the sword and standard of the sultan, the new king (he deserves the title) embraced his departing companions, and could retain only with the gallant <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> knights, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand foot-soldiers for the defence of Palestine.
 His sovereignty was soon attacked by a new enemy, the only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> against whom <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> was a coward.
 Adhemar, bishop of Puy, who excelled both in council and action, had been swept away in the last plague at Antioch: the remaining ecclesiastics preserved only the pride and avarice of their character; and their seditious clamours had required that the choice of a bishop should precede that of a king.
 The revenue and jurisdiction of the lawful patriarch were usurped by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: the exclusion of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Syrians</NORP> was justified by the reproach of heresy or schism; (116) and, under the iron yoke of their deliverers, the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> <NORP>Christians</NORP> regretted the tolerating government of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> caliphs.
 Daimbert, archbishop of Pisa, had long been trained in the secret policy of Rome: he brought a fleet at his countrymen to the succour of the Holy Land, and was installed, without a competitor, the spiritual and temporal head of the church.
 The new patriarch (117) immediately grasped the sceptre which had been acquired by the toil and blood of the victorious pilgrims; and both <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> and <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> submitted to receive at his hands the investiture of their feudal possessions.
 Nor was this sufficient; <PERSON>Daimbert</PERSON> claimed the immediate property of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> and Jaffa; instead of a firm and generous refusal, the hero negotiated with the priest; a <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of either city was ceded to the church; and the modest bishop was satisfied with an eventual reversion of the rest, on the death of <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> without children, or on the future acquisition of a new seat at <GPE>Cairo</GPE> or Damascus.
 The kingdom of Jerusalem, A.
D.
 1099-1187.
 Without this indulgence, the conqueror would have almost been stripped of his infant kingdom, which consisted only of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> and Jaffa, with about twenty villages and towns of the adjacent country.
 (118) Within this narrow verge, the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> were still lodged in some impregnable castles: and the husbandman, the trader, and the pilgrim, were exposed to <DATE>daily</DATE> and domestic hostility.
 By the arms of <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> himself, and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Baldwins, his brother and cousin, who succeeded to the throne, the <NORP>Latins</NORP> breathed with more ease and safety; and at length they equalled, in the extent of their dominions, though not in the <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of their subjects, the ancient princes of <GPE>Judah</GPE> and Israel.
 (119) After the reduction of the maritime cities of Laodicea, Tripoli, Tyre, and Ascalon, (120) which were powerfully assisted by the fleets of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, and even of <GPE>Flanders</GPE> and Norway, (121) the range of sea-coast from <GPE>Scanderoon</GPE> to the borders of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> was possessed by the <NORP>Christian</NORP> pilgrims.
 If the prince of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> disclaimed his supremacy, the counts of <PERSON>Edessa</PERSON> and <GPE>Tripoli</GPE> owned themselves the vassals of the king of Jerusalem: the <NORP>Latins</NORP> reigned beyond the Euphrates; and the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> cities of Hems, Hamah, Damascus, and Aleppo, were the only relics of the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> conquests in Syria.
 (122) The laws and language, the manners and titles, of the <NORP>French</NORP> nation and <NORP>Latin</NORP> church, were introduced into these transmarine colonies.
 According to the feudal jurisprudence, the principal states and subordinate baronies descended in the line of male and female succession: (123) but the children of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conquerors, (124) a motley and degenerate race, were dissolved by the luxury of the climate; the arrival of new crusaders from <LOC>Europe</LOC> was a doubtful hope and a casual event.
 The service of the feudal tenures (125) was performed by <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-six knights, who might expect the aid of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> more under the banner of the count of Tripoli; and each knight was attended to the field by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> squires or archers on horseback.
 (126) Five thousand and seventy-five serjeants, most probably foot-soldiers, were supplied by the churches and cities; and the whole legal militia of the kingdom could not exceed eleven thousand men, a slender defence against the surrounding myriads of <NORP>Saracens</NORP> and Turks.
 (127) But the firmest bulwark of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> was founded on the knights of the Hospital of St.
 John, (128) and of the temple of Solomon; (129) on the strange association of a monastic and military life, which fanaticism might suggest, but which policy must approve.
 The flower of the nobility of <LOC>Europe</LOC> aspired to wear the cross, and to profess the vows, of these respectable orders; their spirit and discipline were immortal; and the speedy donation of <CARDINAL>twenty-eight</CARDINAL> thousand farms, or manors, (130) enabled them to support a regular force of cavalry and infantry for the defence of Palestine.
 The austerity of the convent soon evaporated in the exercise of arms; the world was scandalized by the pride, avarice, and corruption of these <NORP>Christian</NORP> soldiers; their claims of immunity and jurisdiction disturbed the harmony of the church and state; and the public peace was endangered by their jealous emulation.
 But in their most dissolute period, the knights of their hospital and temple maintained their fearless and fanatic character: they neglected to live, but they were prepared to die, in the service of Christ; and the spirit of chivalry, the parent and offspring of the crusades, has been transplanted by this institution from the holy sepulchre to the Isle of Malta.
 (131) Assise of Jerusalem, A.
D.
 1099-1369.
 The spirit of freedom, which pervades the feudal institutions, was felt in its strongest energy by the volunteers of the cross, who elected for their chief the most deserving of his peers.
 Amidst the slaves of Asia, unconscious of the lesson or example, a model of political liberty was introduced; and the laws of the <NORP>French</NORP> kingdom are derived from the purest source of equality and justice.
 Of such laws, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and indispensable condition is the assent of those whose obedience they require, and for whose benefit they are designed.
 No sooner had <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> accepted the office of supreme magistrate, than he solicited the public and private advice of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> pilgrims, who were the best skilled in the statutes and customs of Europe.
 From these materials, with the counsel and approbation of the patriarch and barons, of the clergy and laity, <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> composed the ASSISE OF JERUSALEM, (132) a precious monument of feudal jurisprudence.
 The new code, attested by the seals of the king, the patriarch, and the viscount of Jerusalem, was deposited in the holy sepulchre, enriched with the improvements of succeeding times, and respectfully consulted as often as any doubtful question arose in the tribunals of Palestine.
 With the kingdom and city all was lost: (133) the fragments of the written law were preserved by jealous tradition (134) and variable practice till the middle of the thirteenth century: the code was restored by the pen of John d'Ibelin, count of Jaffa, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the principal feudatories; (135) and the final revision was accomplished in the year <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-nine, for the use of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> kingdom of Cyprus.
 (136) Court of peers.
 The justice and freedom of the constitution were maintained by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tribunals of unequal dignity, which were instituted by <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> after the conquest of Jerusalem.
 The king, in person, presided in the upper court, the court of the barons.
 Of these the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> most conspicuous were the prince of Galilee, the lord of <GPE>Sidon</GPE> and Caesarea, and the counts of <PERSON>Jaffa</PERSON> and Tripoli, who, perhaps with the constable and marshal, (137) were in a special manner the compeers and judges of each other.
 But all the nobles, who held their lands immediately of the crown, were entitled and bound to attend the king's court; and each baron exercised a similar jurisdiction on the subordinate assemblies of his own feudatories.
 The connection of lord and vassal was honourable and voluntary: reverence was due to the benefactor, protection to the dependant; but they mutually pledged their faith to each other; and the obligation on either side might be suspended by neglect or dissolved by injury.
 The cognizance of marriages and testaments was blended with religion, and usurped by the clergy: but the civil and criminal causes of the nobles, the inheritance and tenure of their fiefs, formed the proper occupation of the supreme court.
 Each member was the judge and guardian both of public and private rights.
 It was his duty to assert with his tongue and sword the lawful claims of the lord; but if an unjust superior presumed to violate the freedom or property of a vassal, the confederate peers stood forth to maintain his quarrel by word and deed.
 They boldly affirmed his innocence and his wrongs; demanded the restitution of his liberty or his lands; suspended, after a fruitless demand, their own service; rescued their brother from prison; and employed every weapon in his defence, without offering direct violence to the person of their lord, which was ever sacred in their eyes.
 (138) In their pleadings, replies, and rejoinders, the advocates of the court were subtle and copious; but the use of argument and evidence was often superseded by judicial combat; and the Assise of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> admits in many cases this barbarous institution, which has been slowly abolished by the laws and manners of Europe.
 <PERSON>Law</PERSON> of judicial combats.
 The trial by battle was established in all criminal cases which affected the life, or limb, or honour, of any person; and in all civil transactions, of or above the value of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mark of silver.
 It appears that in criminal cases the combat was the privilege of the accuser, who, except in a charge of treason, avenged his personal injury, or the death of those persons whom he had a right to represent; but wherever, from the nature of the charge, testimony could be obtained, it was necessary for him to produce witnesses of the fact.
 In civil cases, the combat was not allowed as the means of establishing the claim of the demandant; but he was obliged to produce witnesses who had, or assumed to have, knowledge of the fact.
 The combat was then the privilege of the defendant; because he charged the witness with an attempt by perjury to take away his right.
 He came therefore to be in the same situation as the appellant in criminal cases.
 It was not then as a mode of proof that the combat was received, nor as making negative evidence, (according to the supposition of Montesquieu; (139)) but in every case the right to offer battle was founded on the right to pursue by arms the redress of an injury; and the judicial combat was fought on the same principle, and with the same spirit, as a private duel.
 Champions were only allowed to women, and to men maimed or past the age of sixty.
 The consequence of a defeat was death to the person accused, or to the champion or witness, as well as to the accuser himself: but in civil cases, the demandant was punished with infamy and the loss of his suit, while his witness and champion suffered ignominious death.
 In many cases it was in the option of the judge to award or to refuse the combat: but <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> are specified, in which it was the inevitable result of the challenge; if a faithful vassal gave the lie to his compeer, who unjustly claimed any portion of their lord's demesnes; or if an unsuccessful suitor presumed to impeach the judgment and veracity of the court.
 He might impeach them, but the terms were severe and perilous: in the same day he successively fought all the members of the tribunal, even those who had been absent; a single defeat was followed by death and infamy; and where none could hope for victory, it is highly probable that none would adventure the trial.
 In the Assise of Jerusalem, the legal subtlety of the count of <PERSON>Jaffa</PERSON> is more laudably employed to elude, than to facilitate, the judicial combat, which he derives from a principle of honour rather than of superstition.

 Among the causes which enfranchised the plebeians from the yoke of feudal tyranny, the institution of cities and corporations is <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most powerful; and if those of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> are coeval with the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade, they may be ranked with the most ancient of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world.
 Many of the pilgrims had escaped from their lords under the banner of the cross; and it was the policy of the <NORP>French</NORP> princes to tempt their stay by the assurance of the rights and privileges of freemen.
 It is expressly declared in the Assise of Jerusalem, that after instituting, for his knights and barons, the court of peers, in which he presided himself, <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> established a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> tribunal, in which his person was represented by his viscount.
 The jurisdiction of this inferior court extended over the burgesses of the kingdom; and it was composed of a select number of the most discreet and worthy citizens, who were sworn to judge, according to the laws of the actions and fortunes of their equals.
 (141) In the conquest and settlement of new cities, the example of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> was imitated by the kings and their great vassals; and above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> similar corporations were founded before the loss of the Holy Land.
 Syrians.
 Another class of subjects, the Syrians, (142) or <NORP>Oriental</NORP> Christians, were oppressed by the zeal of the clergy, and protected by the toleration of the state.
 <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> listened to their reasonable prayer, that they might be judged by their own national laws.
 A <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> court was instituted for their use, of limited and domestic jurisdiction: the sworn members were Syrians, in blood, language, and religion; but the office of the president (in Arabic, of the rais) was sometimes exercised by the viscount of the city.
 Villains and slaves.
 At an immeasurable distance below the nobles, the burgesses, and the strangers, the Assise of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> condescends to mention the villains and slaves, the peasants of the land and the captives of war, who were almost equally considered as the objects of property.
 The relief or protection of these unhappy men was not esteemed worthy of the care of the legislator; but he diligently provides for the recovery, though not indeed for the punishment, of the fugitives.
 Like hounds, or hawks, who had strayed from the lawful owner, they might be lost and claimed: the slave and falcon were of the same value; but <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> slaves, or <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> oxen, were accumulated to equal the price of the war- horse; and a sum of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pieces of gold was fixed, in the age of chivalry, as the equivalent of the more noble animal.
