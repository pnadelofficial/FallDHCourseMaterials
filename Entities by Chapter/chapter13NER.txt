 As the reign of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was more illustrious than that of any of his predecessors, so was his birth more abject and obscure.
 The strong claims of merit and of violence had frequently superseded the ideal prerogatives of nobility; but a distinct line of separation was hitherto preserved between the free and the servile part of mankind.
 The parents of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> had been slaves in the house of Anulinus, a <NORP>Roman</NORP> senator; nor was he himself distinguished by any other name than that which he derived from a small town in Dalmatia, from whence his mother deduced her origin.
 (1) It is, however, probable that his father obtained the freedom of the family, and that he soon acquired an office of scribe, which was commonly exercised by persons of his condition.
 (2) Favourable oracles, or rather the consciousness of superior merit, prompted his aspiring son to pursue the profession of arms and the hopes of fortune; and it would be extremely curious to observe the graduation of arts and accidents which enabled him in the end to fulfil those oracles, and to display that merit to the world.
 <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was successively promoted to the government of Maesia, the honours of the consulship, and the important command of the guards of the palace.
 He distinguished his abilities in the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war; and after the death of Numerian, the slave, by the confession and judgment of his rivals, was declared the most worthy of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> throne.
 The malice of religious zeal, whilst it arraigns the savage fierceness of his colleague Maximian, has affected to cast suspicion on the personal courage of the emperor Diocletian.
 (3) It would not be easy to persuade us of the cowardice of a soldier of fortune who acquired and preserved the esteem of the legions, as well as the favour of so many warlike princes.
 Yet even calumny is sagacious enough to discover and to attack the most vulnerable part.
 The valour of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was never found inadequate to his duty, or to the occasion; but he appears not to have possessed the daring and generous spirit of a hero, who courts danger and fame, disdains artifice, and boldly challenges the allegiance of his equals.
 His abilities were useful rather than splendid - a vigorous mind improved by the experience and study of mankind; dexterity and application in business; a judicious mixture of liberality and economy, of mildness and rigour; profound dissimulation under the disguise of military frankness; steadiness to pursue his ends; flexibility to vary his means; and, above all, the great art of submitting his own passions, as well as those of others, to the interest of his ambition, and of colouring his ambition with the most specious pretences of justice and public utility.
 Like Augustus, <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> may be considered as the founder of a new empire.
 Like the adopted son of Caesar, he was distinguished as a statesman rather than as a warrior; nor did either of those princes employ force, whenever their purpose could be effected by policy.
 His clemency and victory.
 The victory of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was remarkable for its singular mildness.
 A people accustomed to applaud the clemency of the conqueror, if the usual punishments of death, exile, and confiscation were inflicted with any degree of temper and equity, beheld, with the most pleasing astonishment, a civil war, the flames of which were extinguished in the field of battle.
 <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> received into his confidence Aristobulus, the principal minister of the house of Carus, respected the lives, the fortunes, and the dignity of his adversaries, and even continued in their respective stations the greater number of the servants of Carinus.
 (4) It is not improbable that motives of prudence might assist the humanity of the artful Dalmatian: of these servants, many had purchased his favour by secret treachery; in others, he esteemed their grateful fidelity to an unfortunate master.
 The discerning judgment of Aurelian, of Probus, and of Carus, had filled the several departments of the state and army with officers of approved merit, whose removal would have injured the public service, without promoting the interest of the successor.
 Such a conduct, however, displayed to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world the fairest prospect of the new reign, and he emperor affected to confirm this favourable prepossession by declaring that, among all the virtues of his predecessors, he was the most ambitious of imitating the humane philosophy of <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> Antoninus.
 (5) Association and character of Maximian.
 A.
D.
 286.
 April 1.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> considerable action of his reign seemed to evince his sincerity as well as his moderation.
 After the example of Marcus, he gave himself a colleague in the person of Maximian, on whom he bestowed at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> the title of Caesar, and afterwards that of Augustus.
 (6) But the motives of his conduct, as well as the object of his choice, were of a very different nature from those of his admired predecessor.
 By investing a luxurious youth with the honours of the purple, <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> had discharged a debt of private gratitude, at the expense, indeed, of the happiness of the state.
 By associating a friend and a fellow-soldier to the favours of government, Diocletian, in a time of public danger, provided for the defence both of the <LOC>East</LOC> and of the West.
 <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> was born a peasant, and, like Aurelian, in the territory of Sirmium.
 Ignorant of Letters, (7) careless of laws, the rusticity of his appearance and manners still betrayed in the most elevated fortune the meanness of his extraction.
 War was the only art which he professed.
 In a long course of service he had distinguished himself on every frontier of the empire; and though his military talents were formed to obey rather than to command, though, perhaps, he never attained the skill of a consummate general, he was capable, by his valour, constancy, and experience, of executing the most arduous undertakings.
 Nor were the vices of <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> less useful to his benefactor.
 Insensible to pity, and fearless of consequences, he was the ready instrument of every act of cruelty which the policy of that artful prince might at once suggest and disclaim.
 As soon as a bloody sacrifice had been offered to prudence or to revenge, Diocletian, by his seasonable intercession, saved the remaining few whom he had never designed to punish, gently censured the severity of his stern colleague, and enjoyed the comparison of a golden and an iron age, which was universally applied to their opposite maxims of government.
 Notwithstanding the difference of their characters, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors maintained, on the throne, that friendship which they had contracted in a private station.
 The haughty, turbulent spirit of Maximian, so fatal afterwards to himself and to the public peace, was accustomed to respect the genius of Diocletian, and confessed the ascendant of reason over brutal violence.
 (8) From a motive either of pride or superstition, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors assumed the titles, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of Jovius, the other of Herculius.
 Whilst the motion of the world (such was the language of their venal orators) was maintained by the all-seeing wisdom of Jupiter, the invincible arm of <ORG>Hercules</ORG> purged the earth from monsters and tyrants.

 March 1.
 But even the omnipotence of <PRODUCT>Jovius</PRODUCT> and <GPE>Herculius</GPE> was insufficient to sustain the weight of the public administration.
 The prudence of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> discovered that the empire, assailed on every side by the barbarians, required on every side the presence of a great army and of an emperor.
 With this view, he resolved once more to divide his unwieldy power, and, with the inferior title of Caesar, to confer on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals of approved merit an equal share of the sovereign authority.
 (10) Galerius, surnamed Armentarius, from his original profession of a herdsman, and Constantius, who from his pale complexion had acquired the denomination of Chlorus, (11) were the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> persons invested with the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> honours of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> purple.
 In describing the country, extraction, and manners of Herculius, we have already delineated those of Galerius, who was often, and not improperly, styled the younger Maximian, though, in many instances both of virtue and ability, he appears to have possessed a manifest superiority over the elder.
 The birth of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was less obscure than that of his colleagues.
 Eutropius, his father, was <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most considerable nobles of Dardania, and his mother was the niece of the emperor Claudius.
 (12) Although the youth of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> had been spent in arms, he was endowed with a mild and amiable disposition, and the popular voice had long since acknowledged him worthy of the rank which he at last attained.
 To strengthen the bonds of political, by those of domestic, union, each of the emperors assumed the character of a father to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the Caesars, <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> to Galerius, and <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> to Constantius; and each, obliging them to repudiate their former wives, bestowed his daughter in marriage on his adopted son.
 (13) These <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> princes distributed among themselves the wide extent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 Departments and harmony of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> princes.
 The defence of Gaul, Spain, (14) and <GPE>Britain</GPE> was intrusted to Constantius: <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> was stationed on the banks of the Danube, as the safeguard of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> provinces.
 <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> were considered as the department of Maximian; and for his peculiar portion <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> reserved Thrace, Egypt, and the rich countries of Asia.
 Every <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> was sovereign within his own jurisdiction; but their united authority extended over the whole monarchy, and each of them was prepared to assist his colleagues with his counsels or presence.
 The Caesars, in their exalted rank, revered the majesty of the emperors, and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> younger princes invariably acknowledged, by their gratitude and obedience, the common parent of their fortunes.
 The suspicious jealousy of power found not any place among them; and the singular happiness of their union has been compared to a chorus of music, whose harmony was regulated and maintained by the skilful hand of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> artist.
 (15) Series of events.
 This important measure was not carried into execution till about six years after the association of Maximian, and that interval of time had not been destitute of memorable incidents.
 But we have preferred for the sake of perspicuity, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to describe the more perfect form of Diocletian's government, and afterwards to relate the actions of his reign, following rather the natural order of the events than the dates of a very doubtful chronology.
 A.
D.
 287.
 State of the peasants of Gaul.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit of Maximian, though it is mentioned in a few words by our imperfect writers, deserves, from its singularity, to be recorded in a history of human manners.
 He suppressed the peasants of Gaul, who, under the appellation of Bagaudae, (16) had risen in a general insurrection; very similar to those which in the fourteenth century successively afflicted both <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 (17) It should seem that very many of those institutions, referred by an easy solution to the feudal system, are derived from the <NORP>Celtic</NORP> barbarians.
 When <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> subdued the Gauls, that great nation was already divided into <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> orders of men the clergy, the nobility, and the common people.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> governed by superstition, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> by arms, but the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> and last was not of any weight or account in their public councils.
 It was very natural for the plebeians, oppressed by debt or apprehensive of injuries, to implore the protection of some powerful chief, who acquired over their persons and property the same absolute rights as, among the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Romans, a master exercised over his slaves.
 (18) The greatest part of the nation was gradually reduced in a state of servitude; compelled to perpetual labour on the estates of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> nobles, and confined to the soil, either by the real weight of fetters, or by the no less cruel and forcible restraints of the laws.
 During the long series of troubles which agitated Gaul, from the reign of <PERSON>Gallienus</PERSON> to that of Diocletian, the condition of those servile peasants was peculiarly miserable; and they experienced at once the complicated tyranny of their masters, of the barbarians, of the soldiers, and of the officers of the revenue.
 (19) Their rebellion.
 Their patience was at last provoked into despair.
 On every side they rose in multitudes, armed with rustic weapons, and with irresistible fury.
 The ploughman became a foot soldier, the shepherd mounted on horseback, the deserted villages and open towns were abandoned to the flames, and the ravages of the peasants equalled those of the fiercest barbarians.
 (20) They asserted the natural rights of men, but they asserted those rights with the most savage cruelty.
 The <NORP>Gallic</NORP> nobles, justly dreading their revenge, either took refuge in the fortified cities, or fled from the wild scene of anarchy.
 The peasants reigned without control, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of their most daring leaders had the folly and rashness to assume the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> ornaments.
 (21) Their power soon expired at the approach of the legions.
 The strength of union and discipline obtained an easy victory over a licentious and divided multitude.
 (22) and chastisement.
 A severe retaliation was inflicted on the peasants who were found in arms: the affrighted remnant returned to their respective habitations, and their unsuccessful effort for freedom served only to confirm their slavery.
 So strong and uniform is the current of popular passions, that we might almost venture, from very scanty materials, to relate the particulars of this war but we are not disposed to believe that the principal leaders, <PERSON>Aelianus</PERSON> and Amandus, were Christians, (23) or to insinuate that the rebellion, as it happened in the time of Luther, was occasioned by the abuse of those benevolent principles of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> which inculcate the natural freedom of mankind.
 Revolt of <PERSON>Carausius</PERSON> in Britain.
 <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> had no sooner recovered <LOC>Gaul</LOC> from the hands of the peasants, than he lost <GPE>Britain</GPE> by the usurpation of Carausius.
 Ever since the rash but successful enterprise of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> under the reign of Probus, their daring countrymen had constructed squadrons of light brigantines, in which they incessantly ravaged the provinces adjacent to the ocean.
 (24) To repel their desultory incursions, it was found necessary to create a naval power and the judicious measure was prosecuted with prudence and vigour.
 Gessoriacum, or Boulogne, in the straits of the <NORP>British</NORP> Channel, was chosen by the emperor for the station of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> fleet; and the command of it was intrusted to Carausius, a <NORP>Menapian</NORP> of the meanest origin, (25) but who had long signalised his skill as a pilot and his valour as a soldier.
 The integrity of the new admiral corresponded not with his abilities.
 When the <NORP>German</NORP> pirates sailed from their own harbours he connived at their passage, but he diligently intercepted their return, and appropriated to his own use an ample share of the spoil which they had acquired.
 The wealth of <PERSON>Carausius</PERSON> was, on this occasion, very justly considered as an evidence of his guilt; and <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> had already given orders for his death.
 But the crafty <NORP>Menapian</NORP> foresaw and prevented the severity of the emperor.
 By his liberality he had attached to his fortunes the fleet which he commanded, and secured the barbarians in his interest.
 From the port of <PRODUCT>Boulogne</PRODUCT> he sailed over to Britain, persuaded the legions and the auxiliaries which guarded that island to embrace his party, and boldly assuming, with the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> purple, the title of Augustus, defied the justice and the arms of his injured sovereign.
 (26) Importance of Britain.
 When <GPE>Britain</GPE> was thus dismembered from the empire its importance was sensibly felt and its loss sincerely lamented.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> celebrated, and perhaps magnified, the extent of that noble island, provided on every side with convenient harbours; the temperature of the climate, and the fertility of the soil, alike adapted for the production of corn.
 or of vines; the valuable minerals with which it abounded; its rich pastures covered with innumerable flocks, and its woods free from wild beasts or venomous serpents.
 Above all, they regretted the large amount of the revenue of Britain, whilst they confessed that such a province well deserved to become the seat of an independent monarchy.
 (27) Power of Carausius.
 During the space of seven years it was possessed by Carausius; and fortune continued propitious to a rebellion supported with courage and ability.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> emperor defended the frontiers of his dominions against the <NORP>Caledonians</NORP> of the North, invited from the continent a great number of skilful artists, and displayed, on a variety of coins that are still extant, his taste and opulence.
 Born on the confines of the Franks, he courted the friendship of that formidable people by the flattering imitation of their dress and manners.
 The bravest of their youths he enlisted among his land or sea forces; and, in return for their useful alliance, he communicated to the barbarians the dangerous knowledge of military and naval arts.
 <PERSON>Carausius</PERSON> still preserved the possession of <PRODUCT>Boulogne</PRODUCT> and the adjacent country.
 His fleets rode triumphant in the channel, commanded the mouths of the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and of the Rhine, ravaged the coasts of the ocean, and diffused beyond the Columns of <ORG>Hercules</ORG> the terror of his name.
 Under his command, Britain, destined in a future age to obtain the empire of the sea, already assumed its natural and respectable station of a maritime power.
 (28) A.

 Acknowledged by the other emperor.
 By seizing the fleet of Boulogne, <PERSON>Carausius</PERSON> had deprived his master of the means of pursuit and revenge.
 And when, after a vast expense of time and labour, a new armament was launched into the water, (29) the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> troops, unaccustomed to that element, were easily baffled and defeated by the veteran sailors of the usurper.
 This disappointed effort was soon productive of a treaty of peace.
 <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and his colleague, who justly dreaded the enterprising spirit of Carausius, resigned to him the sovereignty of Britain, and reluctantly admitted their perfidious servant to a participation of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> honours.
 (30) But the adoption of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> restored new vigour to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms; and while the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> was guarded by the presence of Maximian, his brave associate <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> assumed the conduct of the <NORP>British</NORP> war.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> enterprise was against the important place of Boulogne.
 A stupendous mole, raised across the entrance of the harbour, intercepted all hopes of relief.
 The town surrendered after an obstinate defence; and a considerable part of the naval strength of <PERSON>Carausius</PERSON> fell into the hands of the besiegers.
 During the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years which <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> employed in preparing a fleet adequate to the conquest of Britain, he secured the coast of Gaul, invaded the country of the Franks, and deprived the usurper of the assistance of those powerful allies.
 A.
D.
 294.
 His death.
 Before the preparations were finished, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> received the intelligence of the tyrant's death, and it was considered as a sure presage of the approaching victory.
 The servants of <PERSON>Carausius</PERSON> imitated the example of treason which he had given.
 He was murdered by his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> minister Allectus, and the assassin succeeded to his power and to his danger.
 But he possessed not equal abilities either to exercise the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> or to repel the other.
 He beheld with anxious terror the opposite shores of the continent, already filled with arms, with troops, and with vessels; for <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> had very prudently divided his forces, that he might likewise divide the attention and resistance of the enemy.
 A.
D.
 296.
 Recovery of <GPE>Britain</GPE> by Constantius.
 The attack was at length made by the principal squadron, which, under the command of the praefect Asclepiodotus, an officer of distinguished merit, had been assembled in the mouth of the Seine.
 So imperfect in those times was the art of navigation, that orators have celebrated the daring courage of the Romans, who ventured to set sail with a side wind, and on a stormy day.
 The weather proved favourable to their enterprise.
 Under the cover of a thick fog they escaped the fleet of Allectus, which had been stationed off the Isle of Wight to receive them, landed in safety on some part of the western coast, and convinced the <NORP>Britons</NORP> that a superiority of naval strength will not always protect their country from a foreign invasion.
 <PERSON>Asclepiodotus</PERSON> had no sooner disembarked the imperial troops than he set fire to his ships; and, as the expedition proved fortunate, his heroic conduct was universally admired.
 The usurper had posted himself near London, to expect the formidable attack of Constantius, who commanded in person the fleet of Boulogne; but the descent of a new enemy required his immediate presence in the West.
 He performed this long march in so precipitate a manner that he encountered the whole force of the praefect with a small body of harassed and disheartened troops.
 The engagement was soon terminated by the total defeat and death of Allectus; a single battle, as it has often happened, decided the fate of this great island; and when <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> landed on the shores of Kent, he found them covered with obedient subjects.
 Their acclamations were loud and unanimous; and the virtues of the conqueror may induce us to believe that they sincerely rejoiced in a revolution which, after a separation of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years, restored <GPE>Britain</GPE> to the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (31) Defence of the frontiers.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> had none but domestic enemies to dread; and as long as the governors preserved their fidelity, and the troops their discipline, the incursions of the naked savages of <GPE>Scotland</GPE> or <GPE>Ireland</GPE> could never materially affect the safety of the province.
 The peace of the continent, and the defence of the principal rivers which bounded the empire, were objects of far greater difficulty and importance.
 The policy of Diocletian, which inspired the councils of his associates, provided for the public tranquillity, by encouraging a spirit of dissension among the barbarians, and by strengthening the fortifications of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> limit.
 Fortifications.
 In the <LOC>East</LOC> he fixed a line of camps from <GPE>Egypt</GPE> to the <NORP>Persian</NORP> dominions, and, for every camp, he instituted an adequate number of stationary troops, commanded by their respective officers, and supplied with every kind of arms, from the new arsenals which he had formed at Antioch, Emesa, and Damascus.
 (32) Nor was the precaution of the emperor less watchful against the well-known valour of the barbarians of Europe.
 From the mouth of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to that of the Danube, the ancient camps, towns, and citadels were diligently re-established, and, in the most exposed places, new ones were skilfully constructed; the strictest vigilance was introduced among the garrisons of the frontier, and every expedient was practised that could render the long chain of fortifications firm and impenetrable.
 (33) A barrier so respectable was seldom violated, and the barbarians often turned against each other their disappointed rage.
 Dissension of the barbarians.
 The Goths, the Vandals, the Gepidae, the Burgundians, the Alemanni, wasted each other's strength by destructive hostilities: and whosoever vanquished, they vanquished the enemies of Rome.
 The subjects of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> enjoyed the bloody spectacle, and congratulated each other that the mischiefs of civil war were now experienced only by the barbarians.
 (34) Conduct of the emperors.
 Notwithstanding the policy of Diocletian, it was impossible to maintain an equal and undisturbed tranquillity during a reign of twenty years, and along a frontier of many <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles.
 Sometimes the barbarians suspended their domestic animosities, and the relaxed vigilance of the garrisons sometimes gave a passage to their strength or dexterity.
 Whenever the provinces were invaded, <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> conducted himself with that calm dignity which he always affected or possessed; reserved his presence for such occasions as were worthy of his interposition, never exposed his person or reputation to any unnecessary danger, ensured his success by every means that prudence could suggest, and displayed, with ostentation, the consequences of his victory.
 In wars of a more difficult nature, and more doubtful event, he employed the rough valour of Maximian; and that faithful soldier was content to ascribe his own victories to the wise counsels and auspicious influence of his benefactor.
 <PERSON>Valour</PERSON> of the Caesars.
 But after the adoption of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Caesars, the emperors, themselves retiring to a less laborious scene of action, devolved on their adopted sons the defence of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and of the Rhine.
 The vigilant <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> was never reduced to the necessity of vanquishing an army of barbarians on the <NORP>Roman</NORP> territory.
 (35) The brave and active <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> delivered <LOC>Gaul</LOC> from a very furious inroad of the Alemanni; and his victories of <LOC>Langres</LOC> and <PERSON>Vindonissa</PERSON> appear to have been actions of considerable danger and merit.
 As he traversed the open country with a feeble guard, he was encompassed on a sudden by the superior multitude of the enemy.
 He retreated with difficulty towards Langres; but, in the general consternation, the citizens refused to open their gates, and the wounded prince was drawn up the wall by the means of a rope.
 But, on the news of his distress, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops hastened from all sides to his relief, and before the evening he had satisfied his honour and revenge by the slaughter of six thousand Alemanni.
 (36) From the monuments of those times the obscure traces of several other victories over the barbarians of <NORP>Sarmatia</NORP> and <GPE>Germany</GPE> might possibly be collected; but the tedious search would not be rewarded either with amusement or with instruction Treatment of the barbarians The conduct which the emperor <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> had adopted in the disposal of the vanquished was imitated by <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and his associates.
 The captive barbarians, exchanging death for slavery, were distributed among the provincials, and assigned to those districts (in Gaul, the territories of Amiens, Beauvais, Carnbray, Treves, Langres, and Troyes, are particularly specified) (37) which had been depopulated by the calamities of war.
 They were usefully employed as shepherds and husbandmen, but were denied the exercise of arms, except when it was found expedient to enrol them in the military service.
 Nor did the emperors refuse the property of lands, with a less servile tenure, to such of the barbarians as solicited the protection of Rome.
 They granted a settlement to several colonies of the Carpi, the Bastarnae, and the Sarmatians; and, by a dangerous indulgence, permitted them in some measure to retain their national manners and independence.
 (38) Among the provincials it was a subject of flattering exultation that the barbarian, so lately an object of terror, now cultivated their lands, drove their cattle to the neighbouring fair, and contributed by his labour to the public plenty.
 They congratulated their masters on the powerful accession of subjects and soldiers; but they forgot to observe that multitudes of secret enemies, insolent from favour, or desperate from oppression, were introduced into the heart of the empire.
 (39) Wars of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Egypt.
 While the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> exercised their valour on the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and Danube, the presence of the emperors was required on the southern confines of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 From the <LOC>Nile</LOC> to Mount Atlas <LOC>Africa</LOC> was in arms.
 A confederacy of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <NORP>Moorish</NORP> nations issued from their deserts to invade the peaceful provinces.
 (40) <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had assumed the purple at Carthage.
 (41) Achilleus at Alexandria, and even the Blemmyes, renewed, or rather continued, their incursions into the Upper Egypt.
 Scarcely any circumstances have been preserved of the exploits of <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> in the western parts of Africa; but it appears, by the event, that the progress of his arms was rapid and decisive, that he vanquished the fiercest barbarians of Mauritania, and that he removed them from the mountains, whose inaccessible strength had inspired their inhabitants with a lawless confidence, and habituated them to a life of rapine and violence.

 Conduct of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> in Egypt.
 Diocletian, on his side, opened the campaign in <GPE>Egypt</GPE> by the siege of Alexandria, cut off the aqueducts which conveyed the waters of the <LOC>Nile</LOC> into every <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of that immense city, (43) and, rendering his camp impregnable to the sallies of the besieged multitude, he pushed his reiterated attacks with caution and vigour.
 After a siege of eight months, Alexandria, wasted by the sword and by fire, implored the clemency of the conqueror, but it experienced the full extent of his severity.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens perished in a promiscuous slaughter, and there were few obnoxious persons in <GPE>Egypt</GPE> who escaped a sentence either of death or at least of exile.
 (44) The fate of <LOC>Busiris</LOC> and of <LOC>Coptos</LOC> was still more melancholy than that of Alexandria; those proud cities, the former distinguished by its antiquity, the latter enriched by the passage of the <NORP>Indian</NORP> trade, were utterly destroyed by the arms and by the severe order of Diocletian.
 (45) The character of the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> nation, insensible to kindness, but extremely susceptible of fear, could alone justify this excessive rigour.
 The seditions of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> had often affected the tranquillity and subsistence of <GPE>Rome</GPE> itself.
 Since the usurpation of Firmus, the province of Upper Egypt, incessantly relapsing into rebellion, had embraced the alliance of the savages of Ethiopia.
 The number of the Blemmyes, scattered between the island of <LOC>Meroe</LOC> and the Red Sea, was very inconsiderable, their disposition was unwarlike, their weapons rude and inoffensive.
 (46) Yet in the public disorders these barbarians, whom antiquity, shocked with the deformity of their figure, had almost excluded from the human species, presumed to rank themselves among the enemies of Rome.
 (47) Such had been the unworthy allies of the Egyptians; and while the attention of the state was engaged in more serious wars, their vexatious inroads might again harass the repose of the province.
 With a view of opposing to the <NORP>Blemmyes</NORP> a suitable adversary, <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> persuaded the Nobatae, or people of Nubia, to remove from their ancient habitations in the deserts of Libya, and resigned to them an extensive but unprofitable territory above <GPE>Syene</GPE> and the cataracts of the Nile, with the stipulation that they should ever respect and guard the frontier of the empire.
 The treaty long subsisted; and till the establishment of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> introduced stricter notions of religious worship, it was annually ratified by a solemn sacrifice in the isle of Elephantine, in which the Romans, as well as the barbarians, adored the same visible or invisible powers of the universe.
 (48) At the same time that <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> chastised the past crimes of the Egyptians, he provided for their future safety and happiness by many wise regulations, which were confirmed and enforced under the succeeding reigns.
 (49) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> very remarkable edict which he published, instead of being condemned as the effect of jealous tyranny, deserves to be applauded as an act of prudence and humanity.
 He supresses books of alchymy.
 He caused a diligent inquiry to be made "for all the ancient books which treated of the admirable art of making gold and silver, and without pity committed them to the flames; apprehensive, as we are assured, lest the opulence of the <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> should inspire them with confidence to rebel against the empire.
" (50) But if <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> had been convinced of the reality of that valuable art, far from extinguishing the memory, he would have converted the operation of it to the benefit of the public revenue.
 It is much more likely that his good sense discovered to him the folly of such magnificent pretensions, and that he was desirous of preserving the reason and fortunes of his subjects from the mischievous pursuit.
 Novelty and progress of that art.
 It may be remarked that these ancient books, so liberally ascribed to Pythagoras, to Solomon, or to Hermes, were the pious frauds of more recent adepts.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were inattentive either to the use or to the abuse of chemistry.
 In that immense register, where <PERSON>Pliny</PERSON> has deposited the discoveries the arts, and the errors of mankind, there is not the least mention of the transmutation of metals; and the persecution of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> is the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> authentic event in the history of alchemy.
 The conquest of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> by the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> diffused that vain science over the globe.
 Congenial to the avarice of the human heart, it was studied in <GPE>China</GPE> as in Europe, with equal eagerness and with equal success.
 The darkness of the middle ages ensured a favourable reception to every tale of wonder, and the revival of learning gave new vigour to hope, and suggested more specious arts of deception.
 Philosophy, with the aid of experience, has at length banished the study of alchemy; and the present age, however desirous of riches, is content to seek them by the humbler means of commerce and industry.
 (51) The <NORP>Persian</NORP> war.
 The reduction of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> was immediately followed by the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war.
 It was reserved for the reign of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> to vanquish that powerful nation, and to extort a confession from the successors of <PERSON>Artaxerxes</PERSON> of the superior majesty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 <PERSON>Tiridates</PERSON> the Armenian.
 We have observed, under the reign of Valerian, that <GPE>Armenia</GPE> was subdued by the perfidy and the arms of the Persians, and that, after the assassination of Chosroes, his son Tiridates, the infant heir of the monarchy, was saved by the fidelity of his friends, and educated under the protection of the emperors.
 <PERSON>Tiridates</PERSON> derived from his exile such advantages as he could never have obtained on the throne of Armenia; the early knowledge of adversity, of mankind, and of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> discipline.
 He signalised his youth by deeds of valour, and displayed a matchless dexterity, as well as strength, in every martial exercise, and even in the less honourable contests of the <NORP>Olympian</NORP> games.
 (52) Those qualities were more nobly exerted in the defence of his benefactor Licinius.
 (53) That officer, in the sedition which occasioned the death of Probus, was exposed to the most imminent danger, and the enraged soldiers were forcing their way into his tent when they were checked by the single arm of the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> prince.
 The gratitude of <PERSON>Tiridates</PERSON> contributed soon afterwards to his restoration.
 <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> was in every station the friend and companion of Galerius, and the merit of Galerius, long before he was raised to the dignity of Caesar, had been known and esteemed by Diocletian.
 In the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> year of that emperor's reign, <PERSON>Tiridates</PERSON> was invested with the kingdom of Armenia.
 The justice of the measure was not less evident than its expediency.
 It was time to rescue from the usurpation of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch an important territory, which, since the reign of Nero, had been always granted under the protection of the empire to a younger branch of the house of Arsaces.
 (54) A.

 286.
 His restoration to the throne of Armenia.
 When <PERSON>Tiridates</PERSON> appeared on the frontiers of Armenia, he was received with an unfeigned transport of joy and loyalty.
 During twenty-six years the country had experienced the real and imaginary hardships of a foreign yoke.
 The <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarchs adorned their new conquest with magnificent buildings; but those monuments had been erected at the expense of the people, and were abhorred as badges of slavery.
 State of the country.
 The apprehension of a revolt had inspired the most rigorous precautions: oppression had been aggravated by insult, and the consciousness of the public hatred had been productive of every measure that could render it still more implacable.
 We have already remarked the intolerant spirit of the <NORP>Magian</NORP> religion.
 The statues of the deified kings of Armenia, and the sacred images of the sun and moon, were broke in pieces by the zeal of the conqueror and the perpetual fire of <GPE>Ormuzd</GPE> was kindled and preserved upon as altar erected on the summit of Mount Bagavan.
 (55) Revolt of the people and nobles.
 It was natural that a people exasperated by so many injuries should arm with zeal in the cause of their independence, their religion, and their hereditary sovereign.
 The torrent bore down every obstacle, and the <NORP>Persian</NORP> garrisons retreated before its fury.
 The nobles of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> flew to the standard of Tiridates, all alleging their past merit, offering their future service, and soliciting from the new king those honours and rewards from which they had been excluded with disdain under the foreign government.
 (56) The command of the army was bestowed on Artavasdes, whose father had saved the infancy of Tiridates, and whose family had been massacred for that generous action.
 The brother of <PERSON>Artavasdes</PERSON> obtained the government of a province.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> military dignities was conferred on the satrap Otas, a man of singular temperance and fortitude, who presented to the king his sister, (57) and a considerable treasure, both of which, in a sequestered fortress, <PERSON>Otas</PERSON> had preserved from violation.
 Story of Mamgo.
 Among the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> nobles appeared an ally whose fortunes are too remarkable to pass unnoticed.
 His name was Mamgo, his origin was Scythian, and the horde which acknowledged his authority had encamped a very few years before on the skirts of the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> empire, (58) which at that time extended as far as the neighbourhood of Sogdiana.
 (59) Having incurred the displeasure of his master, Mamgo, with his followers, retired to the banks of the Oxus, and implored the protection of Sapor.
 The emperor of <GPE>China</GPE> claimed the fugitive, and alleged the rights of sovereignty.
 The <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch pleaded the laws of hospitality, and with some difficulty avoided a war by the promise that he would banish <PERSON>Mamgo</PERSON> to the uttermost parts of the West, a punishment, as he described it, not less dreadful than death itself.
 <GPE>Armenia</GPE> was chosen for the place of exile, and a large district was assigned to the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> horde, on which they might feed their flocks and herds, and remove their encampment from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> place to another, according to the different seasons of the year.
 They were employed to repel the invasion of Tiridates; but their leader, after weighing the obligations and injuries which he had received from the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch, resolved to abandon his party.
 The <NORP>Armenian</NORP> prince, who was well acquainted with the merit as well as power of Mamgo, treated him with distinguished respect; and, by admitting him into his confidence, acquired a brave and faithful servant, who contributed very effectually to his restoration.
 (60) The <NORP>Persians</NORP> recover Armenia.
 For a while fortune appeared to favour the enterprising valour of Tiridates.
 He not only expelled the enemies of his family and country from the whole extent of Armenia, but in the prosecution of his revenge he carried his arms, or at least his incursions, into the heart of Assyria.
 The historian who has preserved the name of <PERSON>Tiridates</PERSON> from oblivion, celebrates, with a degree of national enthusiasm, his personal prowess and, in the true spirit of eastern romance, describes the giants and the elephants that fell beneath his invincible arm.
 It is from other information that we discover the distracted state of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarchy, to which the king of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> was indebted for some part of his advantages.
 The throne was disputed by the ambition of contending brothers; and Hormuz, after exerting without success the strength of his own party, had recourse to the dangerous assistance of the barbarians who inhabited the banks of the Caspian Sea.
 (61) The civil war was, however, soon terminated, either by a victory or by a reconciliation; and Narses, who was universally acknowledged as king of Persia, directed his whole force against the foreign enemy.
 The contest then became too unequal: nor was the valour of the hero able to withstand the power of the monarch.
 Tiridates, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time expelled from the throne of Armenia, once more took refuge in the court of the emperors.
 <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> soon re-established his authority over the revolted province; and, loudly complaining of the protection afforded by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to rebels and fugitives, aspired to the conquest of the East.
 (62) War between the <NORP>Persians</NORP> and the Romans.
 A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>296</CARDINAL> Neither prudence nor honour could permit the emperors to forsake the cause of the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> king, and it was resolved to exert the force of the empire in the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war.
 Diocletian, with the calm dignity which he constantly assumed, fixed his own station in the city of Antioch, from whence he prepared and directed the military operations.
 (63) The conduct of the legions was intrusted to the intrepid valour of Galerius, who, for that important purpose, was removed from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Euphrates.
Defeat of Galerius.
 The armies soon encountered each other in the plains of Mesopotamia, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles were fought with various and doubtful success; but the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> engagement was of a more decisive nature, and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army received a total overthrow, which is attributed to the rashness of Galerius, who, with an inconsiderable body of troops, attacked the innumerable host of the Persians.
 (64) But the consideration of the country that was the scene of action may suggest another reason for his defeat.
 The same ground on which <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> was vanquished had been rendered memorable by the death of <PERSON>Crassus</PERSON> and the slaughter of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> legions.
 It was a plain of more than sixty miles, which extended from the hills of <GPE>Carrhae</GPE> to the Euphrates; a smooth and barren surface of sandy desert, without a hillock, without a tree, and without a spring of fresh water.
 (65) The steady infantry of the Romans, fainting with heat and thirst, could neither hope for victory if they preserved their ranks, nor break their ranks without exposing themselves to the most imminent danger.
 In this situation they were gradually encompassed by the superior numbers, harassed by the rapid evolutions and destroyed by the arrows of the barbarian cavalry.
 The king of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> had signalised his valour in the battle, and acquired personal glory by the public misfortune.
 He was pursued as far as the Euphrates; his horse was wounded, and it appeared impossible for him to escape the victorious enemy.
 In this extremity <PERSON>Tiridates</PERSON> embraced the only refuge which he saw before him: he dismounted and plunged into the stream.
 His armour was heavy, the river very deep, and at those parts at least half a mile in breadth; (66) yet such was his strength and dexterity, that he reached in safety the opposite bank.
 (67) With regard to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, we are ignorant of the circumstances of his escape; His reception by Diocletian.
 but when he returned to Antioch, <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> received him, not with the tenderness of a friend and colleague, but with the indignation of an offended sovereign.
 The haughtiest of men, clothed in his purple, but humbled by the sense of his fault and misfortune, was obliged to follow the emperor's chariot above a mile on foot, and to exhibit, before the whole court, the spectacle of his disgrace.
 (68) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> campaign of Galerius.
 A.
D.
 297.
 As soon as <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> had indulged his private resentment, and asserted the majesty of supreme power, he yielded to the submissive entreaties of the Caesar, and permitted him to retrieve his own honour, as well as that of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms.
 In the room of the unwarlike troops of Asia, which had most probably served in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> expedition, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army was drawn from the veterans and new levies of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier, and a considerable body of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> auxiliaries were taken into the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> pay.
 (69) At the head of a chosen army of twenty-five thousand men <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> again passed the Euphrates; but, instead of exposing his legions in the open plains of Mesopotamia, he advanced through the mountains of Armenia, where he found the inhabitants devoted to his cause, and the country as favourable to the operations of infantry as it was inconvenient for the motions of cavalry.
 (70)His victory.
 Adversity had confirmed the <NORP>Roman</NORP> discipline, while the barbarians, elated by success, were become so negligent and remiss that, in the moment when they least expected it, they were surprised by the active conduct of Galerius, who, attended only by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> horsemen, had with his own eyes secretly examined the state and position of their camp.
 A surprise, especially in the night-time, was for the most part fatal to a <NORP>Persian</NORP> army.
 On this occasion the impetuous attack of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> spread disorder and dismay over the camp of the barbarians.
 A slight resistance was followed by a dreadful carnage, and in the general confusion the wounded monarch (for <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> commanded his armies in person) fled towards the deserts of Media.
 His sumptuous tents, and those of his satraps, afforded an immense booty to the conqueror; and an incident is mentioned which proves the rustic but martial ignorance of the legions in the elegant superfluities of life.
 A bag of shining leather, filled with pearls, fell into the hands of a private soldier; he carefully preserved the bag, but he threw away its contents, judging that whatever was of no use could not possibly be of any value.
 (72)and behaviour to his royal captives.
 The principal loss of <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> was of a much more affecting nature.
 Several of his wives, his sisters, and children, who had attended the army, were made captives in the defeat.
 But though the character of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> had in general very little affinity with that of Alexander, he imitated, after his victory, the amiable behaviour of the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> towards the family of Darius.
 The wives and children of <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> were protected from violence and rapine, conveyed to a place of safety, and treated; with every mark of respect and tenderness that was due from a generous enemy to their age, their sex, and their royal dignity.
 (73) Negotiation for peace.
 While the <LOC>East</LOC> anxiously expected the decision of this great contest, the emperor Diocletian, having assembled in <GPE>Syria</GPE> a strong army of observation, displayed from a distance the resources of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> power, and reserved himself for any future emergency of the war.
 On the intelligence of the victory he condescended to advance towards the frontier, with a view of moderating, by his presence and counsels, the pride of Galerius.
 The interview of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes at <PRODUCT>Nisibis</PRODUCT> was accompanied with every expression of respect on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> side, and of esteem on the other.
 It was in that city that they soon afterwards gave audience to the ambassador of the Great King.
 (74) The power, or at least the spirit, of <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> had been broken by his last defeat; and he considered an immediate peace as the only means that could stop the progress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms.
 He despatched Apharban, a servant who possessed his favour and confidence, with a commission to negotiate a treaty, or rather to receive whatever conditions the conqueror should impose.
Speech of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> ambassador.
 <PERSON>Apharban</PERSON> opened the conference by expressing his master's gratitude for the generous treatment of his family, and by soliciting the liberty of those illustrious captives.
 He celebrated the valour of Galerius, without degrading the reputation of Narses, and thought it no dishonour to confess the superiority of the victorious <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> over a monarch who had surpassed in glory all the princes of his race.
 Notwithstanding the justice of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> cause, he was empowered to submit the present differences to the decision of the emperors themselves; convinced as he was that, in the midst of prosperity, they would not be unmindful of the vicissitudes of fortune.
 <PERSON>Apharban</PERSON> concluded his discourse in the style of <NORP>Eastern</NORP> allegory, by observing that the <NORP>Roman</NORP> and <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarchies were the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> eyes of the world, which would remain imperfect and mutilated if either of them should be put out.
 Answer of Gallerius.
 "It well becomes the Persians," replied Galerius, with a transport of fury which seemed to convulse his whole frame, "it well becomes the <NORP>Persians</NORP> to expatiate on the vicissitudes of fortune, and calmly to read us lectures on the virtues of moderation.
 Let them remember their own moderation towards the unhappy Valerian.
 They vanquished him by fraud, they treated him with indignity.
 They detained him till the last moment of his life in shameful captivity, and after his death they exposed his body to perpetual ignominy.
" Softening, however, his tone, <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> insinuated to the ambassador that it had never been the practice of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to trample on a prostrate enemy; and that, on this occasion, they should consult their own dignity rather than the <NORP>Persian</NORP> merit.
 He dismissed <PERSON>Apharban</PERSON> with a hope that <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> would soon be informed on what conditions he night obtain, from the clemency of the emperors, a lasting peace and the restoration of his wives and children.
 In this conference we may discover the fierce passions of Galerius, as well as his deference to the superior wisdom and authority of Diocletian.
 The ambition of the former grasped at the conquest of the East, and had proposed to reduce <GPE>Persia</GPE> into the state of a province.
 Moderation of Diocletian.
 The prudence of the latter, who adhered to the moderate policy of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and the Antonines, embraced the favourable opportunity of terminating a successful war by an honourable and advantageous peace.
 (75) Conclusion.
 In pursuance of their promise, the emperors soon afterwards appointed Sicorius Probus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their secretaries, to acquaint the <NORP>Persian</NORP> court with their final resolution.
 As the minister of peace, he was received with every mark of politeness and friendship; but, under the pretence of allowing him the necessary repose after so long a journey, the audience of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> was deferred from day to day, and he attended the slow motions of the king, till at length he was admitted to his presence, near the river Asprudus, in Media.
 The secret motive of <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> in this delay had been to collect such a military force as might enable him, though sincerely desirous of peace, to negotiate with the greater weight and dignity.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> persons only assisted at this important conference, the minister Apharban, the praefect of the guards, and an officer who had commanded on the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> frontier.
 (76) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> condition proposed by the ambassador is not at present of a very intelligible nature; that the city of <PRODUCT>Nisibis</PRODUCT> might be established for the place of mutual exchange, or, as we should formerly have termed it, for the staple of trade, between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires.
 There is no difficulty in conceiving the intention of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes to improve their revenue by some restraints upon commerce; but as <PRODUCT>Nisibis</PRODUCT> was situated within their own dominions, and as they were masters both of the imports and exports, it should seem that such restraints were the objects of an internal law, rather than of a foreign treaty.
 To render them more effectual, some stipulations were probably required on the side of the king of Persia, which appeared so very repugnant either to his interest or to his dignity that <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> could not be persuaded to subscribe them.
 As this was the only article to which he refused his consent, it was no longer insisted on; and the emperors either suffered the trade to flow in its natural channels, or contented themselves with such restrictions as it depended on their own authority to establish.
 And articles of the treaty As soon as this difficulty was removed, a solemn peace was concluded and ratified between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations.
 The conditions of a treaty so glorious to the empire, and so necessary to Persia, may deserve a more peculiar attention, as the history of <GPE>Rome</GPE> presents very few transactions of a similar nature; most of her wars having either been terminated by absolute conquest, or waged against barbarians ignorant of the use of letters.
The <PRODUCT>Aboras</PRODUCT> fixed as the limits between the empires.
 I.
 The Aboras, or, as it is called by Xenophon, the Araxes, was fixed as the boundary between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> monarchies.
 (77) That river, which rose near the Tigris, was increased, a few miles below Nisibis, by the little stream of the Mygdonius, passed under the walls of Singara, and fell into the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> at Circesium, a frontier town which, by the care of Diocletian, was very strongly fortified.
 (78) Mesopotamia, the object of so many wars, was ceded to the empire; and the Persians, by this treaty, renounced all pretensions to that great province II.
 They relinquished to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> provinces beyond the Tigris.
 (79)Cession of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> provinces beyond the Tigris.
 Their situation formed a very useful barrier, and their natural strength was soon improved by art and military skill.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> of these, to the north of the river, were districts of obscure fame and inconsiderable extent - Intiline, Zabdicene, Arzanene, and Moxoene; but on the east of the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> the empire acquired the large and mountainous territory of Carduene, the ancient seat of the Carduchians, who preserved for many ages their manly freedom in the heart of the despotic monarchies of Asia.
 The <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Greeks</NORP> traversed their country after a painful march, or rather engagement, of seven days; and it is confessed by their leader, in his incomparable relation of the retreat, that they suffered more from the arrows of the <NORP>Carduchians</NORP> than from the power of the Great King.
 (80) Their posterity, the Curds, with very little alteration either of name or manners, acknowledged the nominal sovereignty of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan.
 Armenia.
 III.
 It is almost needless to observe that Tiridates, the faithful ally of Rome, was restored to the throne of his fathers, and that the rights of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> supremacy were fully asserted and secured.
 The limits of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> were extended as far as the forests of <LOC>Sintha</LOC> in Media, and this increase of dominion was not so much an act of liberality as of justice.
 Of the provinces already mentioned beyond the Tigris, the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> had been dismembered by the <PERSON>Parthians</PERSON> from the crown of Armenia; (81) and when the <NORP>Romans</NORP> acquired the possession of them, they stipulated, at the expense of the usurpers, an ample compensation, which invested their ally with the extensive and fertile country of Atropatene.
 Its principal city, in the same situation perhaps as the modern Tauris, was frequently honoured with the residence of Tiridates; and as it sometimes bore the name of Ecbatana, he imitated, in the buildings and fortifications, the splendid capital of the Medes.
 (82)Iberia.
 IV.
 The country of <GPE>Iberia</GPE> was barren, its inhabitants rude and savage.
 But they were accustomed to the use of arms, and they separated from the empire barbarians much fiercer and more formidable than themselves.
 The narrow defiles of Mount Caucasus were in their hands, and it was in their choice either to admit or to exclude the wandering tribes of Sarmatia, whenever a rapacious spirit urged them to penetrate into the richer climates of the South.
 (83) The nomination of the kings of Iberia, which was resigned by the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch to the emperors, contributed to the strength and security of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> power in Asia.
 (84) The <LOC>East</LOC> enjoyed a profound tranquillity during forty years; and the treaty between the rival monarchies was strictly observed till the death of Tiridates; when a new generation, animated with different views and different passions, succeeded to the government of the world; and the grandson of <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> undertook a long and memorable war against the princes of the house of Constantine.
 Triumph of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> amd Maximian.
 A.
D.
 303.
 November <CARDINAL>20</CARDINAL> The arduous work of rescuing the distressed empire from tyrants and barbarians had now been completely achieved by a succession of <NORP>IIlyrian</NORP> peasants.
 As soon as <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> entered into the twentieth year of his reign, he celebrated that memorable era, as well as the success of his arms by the pomp of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> triumph.
 (85) Maximian, the equal partner of his power, was his only companion in the glory of that day.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> had fought and conquered, but the merit of their exploits was ascribed, according to the rigour of ancient maxims, to the auspicious influence of their fathers and emperors.
 (86) The triumph of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> was less magnificent, perhaps, than those of <PERSON>Aurelian</PERSON> and Probus, but it was dignified by several circumstances of superior fame and good fortune.
 <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Britain, the Rhine, the Danube, and the Nile, furnished their respective trophies; but the most distinguished ornament was of a more singular nature, a <NORP>Persian</NORP> victory followed by an important conquest.
 The representations of rivers, mountains, and provinces were carried before the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> car.
 The images of the captive wives, the sisters, and the children of the Great <PERSON>King</PERSON> afforded a new and grateful spectacle to the vanity of the people.
 (87) In the eyes of posterity this triumph is remarkable by a distinction of a less honourable kind.
 It was the last that <GPE>Rome</GPE> ever beheld.
 Soon after this period the emperors ceased to vanquish, and <GPE>Rome</GPE> ceased to be the capital of the empire.
 Long absence of the emperor from <GPE>Rome</GPE> .
 The spot on which <GPE>Rome</GPE> was founded had been consecrated by ancient ceremonies and imaginary miracles.
 The presence of some god, or the memory of some hero, seemed to animate every part of the city, and the empire of the world had been promised to the Capitol.
 (88) The native <NORP>Romans</NORP> felt and confessed the power of this agreeable illusion.
 It was derived from their ancestors, had grown up with their earliest habits of life, and was protected, in some measure, by the opinion of political utility.
 The form and the seat of government were intimately blended together, nor was it esteemed possible to transport the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> without destroying the other.
 (89) But the sovereignty of the capital was gradually annihilated in the extent of conquest; the provinces rose to the same level, and the vanquished nations acquired the name and privileges, without imbibing the partial affections, of Romans.
 During a long period, however, the remains of the ancient constitution and the influence of custom preserved the dignity of Rome.
 The emperors, though perhaps of <NORP>African</NORP> or <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> extraction, respected their adopted country as the seat of their power and the centre of their extensive dominions.
 The emergencies of war very frequently required their presence on the Frontiers; but <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes who fixed, in time of peace, their ordinary residence in the provinces and their conduct, however it might be suggested by private motives, was justified by very specious considerations of policy.
Their residence at Milan.
 The court of the emperor of the <LOC>West</LOC> was, for the most part, established at Milan, whose situation, at the foot of the Alps, appeared far more convenient than that of Rome, for the important purpose of watching the motions of the barbarians of Germany.
 <GPE>Milan</GPE> soon assumed the splendour of an imperial city.
 The houses are described as numerous and well built; the manners of the people as polished and liberal.
 A circus, a theatre, a mint, a palace, baths, which bore the name of their founder Maximian; porticoes adorned with statues, and a double circumference of walls, contributed to the beauty of the new capital.
 Nor did it seem oppressed even by the proximity of Rome.
 (90) To rival the majesty of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was the ambition likewise of Diocletian, and Nicomedia.
 who employed his leisure and the wealth of the <LOC>East</LOC> in the embellishment of Nicomedia, a city placed on the verge of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, almost at an equal distance between the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the Euphrates.
 By the taste of the monarch, and at the expense of the people, <GPE>Nicomedia</GPE> acquired, in he space of a few years, a degree of magnificence which might appear to have required the labour of ages, and became inferior only to Rome, Alexandria, and <GPE>Antioch</GPE> in extent or populousness.
 (91) The life of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> was a life of action, and a considerable portion of it was spent in camps, or in their long and frequent marches; but whenever the public business allowed them any relaxation, they seemed to have retired with pleasure to their favourite residences of <GPE>Nicomedia</GPE> and Milan.
 Till Diocletian, in the twentieth year of his reign, celebrated his <NORP>Roman</NORP> triumph, it is extremely doubtful whether he ever visited the ancient capital of the empire.
 Even on that memorable occasion his stay did not exceed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months.
 Disgusted with the licentious familiarity of the people, he quitted <GPE>Rome</GPE> with precipitation thirteen days before it was expected that he should have appeared in the senate invested with the ensigns of the consular dignity.
 (92) Debasement of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of the senate.
 The dislike expressed by <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> towards <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <NORP>Roman</NORP> freedom was not the effect of momentary caprice, but the result of the most artful policy.
 The crafty prince had framed a new system of <ORG>Imperial</ORG> government, which was afterwards completed by the family of Constantine; and as the image of the old constitution was religiously preserved in the senate, he resolved to deprive that order of its small remains of power and consideration.
 We may recollect, about eight years before the elevation of Diocletian, the transient greatness and the ambitious hopes of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 As long as that enthusiasm prevailed, many of the nobles imprudently displayed their zeal in the cause of freedom; and after the successors of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> had withdrawn their countenance from the <NORP>republican</NORP> party, the senators were unable to disguise their impotent resentment.
 As the sovereign of Italy, <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> was intrusted with the care of extinguishing this troublesome rather than dangerous spirit, and the task was perfectly suited to his cruel temper.
 The most illustrious members of the senate, whom <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> always affected to esteem, were involved, by his colleague, in the accusation of imaginary plots; and the possession of an elegant villa, or a well-cultivated estate, was interpreted as a convincing evidence of guilt.
 (93) The camp of the Praetorians, which had so long oppressed, began to protect, the majesty of Rome; and as those haughty troops were conscious of the decline of their power, they were naturally disposed to unite their strength with the authority of the senate.
 By the prudent measures of Diocletian, the numbers of the <NORP>Praetorians</NORP> were insensibly reduced, their privileges abolished, (94) and their place supplied by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> faithful legions of Illyricum, New bodies of guards, <NORP>Jovians</NORP> and Herculians.
 who, under the new titles of <NORP>Jovians</NORP> and Herculians, were appointed to perform the service of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> guards.
 (95) But the most fatal though secret wound which the senate received from the hands of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> was inflicted by the inevitable operation of their absence.
 As long as the emperors resided at Rome, that assembly might be oppressed, but it could scarcely be neglected.
 The successors of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> exercised the power of dictating whatever laws their wisdom or caprice might suggest; but those laws were ratified by the sanction of the senate.
 The model of ancient freedom was preserved in its deliberations and decrees; and wise princes, who respected the prejudices of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, were in some measure obliged to assume the language and behaviour suitable to the general and <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate of the republic.
 In the armies and in the provinces they displayed the dignity of monarchs; and when they fixed their residence at a distance from the capital, they forever laid aside the dissimulation which <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> had recommended to his successors.
 In the exercise of the legislative as well as the executive power, the sovereign advised with his ministers, instead of consulting the great council of the nation.
 The name of the senate was mentioned with honour till the last period of the empire; the vanity of its members was still flattered with honorary distinctions; (96) but the assembly which had so long been the source, and so long the instrument of power, was respectfully suffered to sink into oblivion.
 The senate of Rome, losing all connection with the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court and the actual constitution, was left a venerable but useless monument of antiquity on the Capitoline hill.
 Civil magistrates laid aside.
 When the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes had lost sight of the senate and of their ancient capital, they easily forgot the origin and nature of their legal power.
 The civil offices of consul, of proconsul, of censor, and of tribune, by the union of which it had been formed, betrayed to the people its <NORP>republican</NORP> extraction.
 Those modest titles were laid aside; (97) and if they still distinguished their high station by the appellation of Emperor, or IMPERATOR, that word was understood in a new and more dignified sense, and no longer denoted the general of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies, but the sovereign of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 <ORG>Imperial</ORG> dignity and titles.
 The name of Emperor, which was at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of a military nature, was associated with another of a more servile kind.
 The epithet of DOMINUS, or LORD, in its primitive signification, was expressive not of the authority of a prince over his subjects, or of a commander over his soldiers, but of the despotic power of a master over his domestic slaves.
 (98) Viewing it in that odious light, it had been rejected with abhorrence by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Caesars.
 Their resistance insensibly became more feeble, and the name less odious; till at length the style of our Lord and <PERSON>Emperor</PERSON> was not only bestowed by flattery, but was regularly admitted into the laws and public monuments.
 Such lofty epithets were sufficient to elate and satisfy the most excessive vanity; and if the successors of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> still declined the title of King, it seems to have been the effect not so much of their moderation as of their delicacy.
 Wherever the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> tongue was in use (and it was the language of government throughout the empire), the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> title, as it was peculiar to themselves, conveyed a more respectable idea than the name of king, which they must have shared with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> barbarian chieftains; or which, at the best, they could derive only from Romulus, or from Tarquin.
 But the sentiments of the <LOC>East</LOC> were very different from those of the West.
 From the earliest period of history, the sovereigns of <LOC>Asia</LOC> had been celebrated in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language by the title of BASILEUS, or King; and since it was considered as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> distinction among men, it was soon employed by the servile provincials of the <LOC>East</LOC> in their humble addresses to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> throne.
 (99) Even the attributes, or at least the titles, of the DIVINITY were usurped by <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and Maximian, who transmitted them to a succession of <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperors.
 (100) Such extravagant compliments, however, soon lose their impiety by losing their meaning; and when the ear is once accustomed to the sound, they are heard with indifference as vague though excessive professions of respect.
 <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> assumes the diadem, and introduces the <NORP>Persian</NORP> ceremonial.
 From the time of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to that of Diocletian, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes, conversing in a familiar manner among their fellow-citizens, were saluted only with the same respect that was usually paid to senators and magistrates.
 Their principal distinction was the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> or military robe of purple; whilst the senatorial garment was marked by a broad, and the equestrian by a narrow, band or stripe of the same honourable colour.
 The pride, or rather the policy, of Diocletian, engaged that artful prince to introduce the stately magnificence of the court of Persia.
 (101) He ventured to assume the diadem, an ornament detested by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> as the odious ensign of royalty, and the use of which had been considered as the most desperate act of the madness of Caligula.
 It was no more than a broad white fillet set with pearls, which encircled the emperor's head.
 The sumptuous robes of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and his successors were of silk and gold; and it is remarked with indignation that even their shoes were studded with the most precious gems.
 The access to their sacred person was every day rendered more difficult by the institution of new forms and ceremonies.
 The avenues of the palace were strictly guarded by the various schools, as they began to be called, of domestic officers.
 The interior apartments were intrusted to the jealous vigilance of the eunuchs; the increase of whose numbers and influence was the most infallible symptom of the progress of despotism.
 When a subject was at length admitted to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> presence, he was obliged, whatever might be his rank, to fall prostrate on the ground, and to adore, according to the eastern fashion, the divinity of his lord and master.
 (102) <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was a man of sense, who, in the course of private as well as public life, had formed a just estimate both of himself and of mankind: nor is it easy to conceive that in substituting the manners of <GPE>Persia</GPE> to those of <GPE>Rome</GPE> he was seriously actuated by so mean a principle as that of vanity.
 He flattered himself that an ostentation of splendour and luxury would subdue the imagination of the multitude; that the monarch would be less exposed to the rude licence of the people and the soldiers, as his person was secluded from the public view; and that habits of submission would insensibly be productive of sentiments of veneration.
 Like the modesty affected by Augustus, the state maintained by <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was a theatrical representation; but it must be confessed that, of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> comedies, the former was of a much more liberal and manly character than the latter.
 It was the aim of the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> to disguise, and the object of the other to display, the unbounded power which the emperors possessed over the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 New form of administration, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Augusti, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Caesars.
 Ostentation was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> principle of the new system instituted by Diocletian.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> was division.
 He divided the empire, the provinces, and every branch of the civil as well as military administration.
 He multiplied the wheels of the machine of government, and rendered its operations less rapid but more secure.
 Whatever advantages and whatever defects might attend these innovations, they must be ascribed in a very great degree to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> inventor, but as the new frame of policy was gradually improved and completed by succeeding princes, it will be more satisfactory to delay the consideration of it till the season of its full maturity and perfection.
 (103) Reserving, therefore, for the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> a more exact picture of the new empire, we shall content ourselves with describing the principal and decisive outline, as it was traced by the hand of Diocletian.
 He had associated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> colleagues in the exercise of the supreme power; and as he was convinced that the abilities of a single man were inadequate to the public defence, he considered the joint administration of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> princes not as a temporary expedient, but as a fundamental law of the constitution.
 It was his intention that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> elder princes should be distinguished by the use of the diadem and the title of Augusti; that, as affection or esteem might direct their choice, they should regularly call to their assistance <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> subordinate colleagues; and that the Caesars, rising in their turn to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rank, should supply an uninterrupted succession of emperors.
 The empire was divided into <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> parts.
 The <LOC>East</LOC> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> were the most honourable, the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> the most laborious stations.
 The former claimed the presence of the Augusti, the latter were intrusted to the administration of the Caesars.
 The strength of the legions was in the hands of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> partners of sovereignty, and the despair of successively vanquishing <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> formidable rivals might intimidate the ambition of an aspiring general.
 In their civil government the emperors were supposed to exercise the undivided power of the monarch, and their edicts, inscribed with their joint names, were received in all the provinces as promulgated by their mutual councils and authority.
 Notwithstanding these precautions, the political union of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world was gradually dissolved, and a principle of division was introduced, which, in the course of a few years, occasioned the perpetual separation of the eastern and western empires.
 Increase of taxes.
 The system of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was accompanied with another very material disadvantage, which cannot even at present be totally overlooked; a more expensive establishment, and consequently an increase of taxes, and the oppression of the people.
 Instead of a modest family of slaves and freedmen, such as had contented the simple greatness of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> magnificent courts were established in the various parts of the empire, and as many <NORP>Roman</NORP> kings contended with each other and with the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch for the vain superiority of pomp and luxury.
 The number of ministers, of magistrates, of officers, and of servants, who filled the different departments of the state, was multiplied beyond the example of former times; and (if we may borrow the warm expression of a contemporary), "when the proportion of those who received exceeded the proportion of those who contributed, the provinces were oppressed by the weight of tributes.
" (104) From this period to the extinction of the empire, it would be easy to deduce an uninterrupted series of clamours and complaints.
 According to his religion and situation, each writer chooses either Diocletian, or Constantine, or Valens, or Theodosius, for the object of his invectives; but they unanimously agree in representing the burden of the public impositions, and particularly the land-tax and capitation, as the intolerable and increasing grievance of their own times.
 From such a concurrence, an impartial historian, who is obliged to extract truth from satire, as well as from panegyric, will be inclined to divide the blame among the princes whom they accuse, and to ascribe their exactions much less to their personal vices than to the uniform system of their administration.
 The emperor <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was indeed the author of that system; but during his reign the growing evil was confined within the bounds of modesty and discretion, and he deserves the reproach of establishing pernicious precedents, rather than of exercising actual oppression.
 (105) It may be added, that his revenues were managed with prudent economy; and that, after all the current expenses were discharged, there still remained in the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> treasury an ample provision either for judicious liberality or for any emergency of the state.
 Abdication of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and Maximian.
 It was in the twenty <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> year of his reign that <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> executed his memorable resolution of abdicating the empire; an action more naturally to have been expected from the elder or the younger <PERSON>Antoninus</PERSON> than from a prince who had never practised the lessons of philosophy either in the attainment or in the use of supreme power.
 <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> acquired the glory of giving to the world the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> example of a resignation (106) which has not been very frequently imitated by succeeding monarchs.
 Resemblance to <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the Fifth.
 The parallel of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the Fifth, however, will naturally offer itself to our mind, not only since the eloquence of a modern historian has rendered that name so familiar to an <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> reader, but from the very striking resemblance between the characters of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, whose political abilities were superior to their military genius, and whose specious virtues were much less the effect of nature than of art.
 The abdication of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> appears to have been hastened by the vicissitude of fortune; and the disappointment of his favourite schemes urged him to relinquish a power which he found inadequate to his ambition.
 But the reign of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> had flowed with a; tide of uninterrupted success; nor was it till after he had vanquished all his enemies, and accomplished all his designs, that he seems to have entertained any serious thoughts of resigning the empire.
 Neither <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> were arrived at a very advanced period of life; since the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> was only fifty-five, and the other was no more than fifty-nine years of age; but the active life of those princes, their wars and journeys, the cares of royalty, and their application to business, had already impaired their constitution, and brought on the infirmities of a premature old age.

 Long illness of Diocletian.
 Notwithstanding the severity of a very cold and rainy winter, <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> left <GPE>Italy</GPE> soon after the ceremony of his triumph, and began his progress towards the <LOC>East</LOC> round the circuit of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> provinces.
 From the inclemency of the weather and the fatigue of the journey, he soon contracted a slow illness; and though he made easy marches, and was generally carried in a close litter, his disorder, before he arrived at Nicomedia, about the end of the summer, was become very serious and alarming.
 During the whole winter he was confined to his palace; his danger inspired a general and unaffected concern; but the people could only judge of the various alterations of his health from the joy or consternation which they discovered in the countenances and behaviour of his attendants.
 The rumour of his death was for some time universally believed, and it was supposed to be concealed with a view to prevent the troubles that might have happened during the absence of the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> Galerius.
 At length, however, on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of March, <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> once more appeared in public, but so pale and emaciated that he could scarcely have been recognised by those to whom his person was the most familiar.
 His prudence.
 It was time to put an end to the painful struggle, which he had sustained during more than a year, between the care of his health and that of his dignity.
 The former required indulgence and relaxation, the latter compelled him to direct, from the bed of sickness, the administration of a great empire.
 He resolved to pass the remainder of his days in honourable repose, to place his glory beyond the reach of fortune, and to relinquish the theatre of the world to his younger and more active associates.
 (108) A.
D.
 305.
 May <CARDINAL>1</CARDINAL> The ceremony of his abdication was performed in a spacious plain, about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles from Nicomedia.
 The emperor ascended a lofty throne, and, in a speech full of reason and dignity, declared his intention, both to the people and to the soldiers who were assembled on this extraordinary occasion.
 As soon as he had divested himself of the purple, he withdrew from the gazing multitude, and, traversing the city in a covered chariot, proceeded without delay to the favourite retirement which he had chosen in his native country of Dalmatia.
 On the same day, which was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of May, (109) Compliance of Maximian.
 Maximian, as it had been previously concerted, made his resignation of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> dignity at Milan.
 Even in the splendour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> triumph, <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> had meditated his design of abdicating the government.
 As he wished to secure the obedience of Maximian, he exacted from him either a general assurance that he would submit his actions to the authority of his benefactor, or a particular promise that he would descend from the throne whenever he should receive the advice and the example.
 This engagement, though it was confirmed by the solemnity of an oath before the altar of the Capitoline Jupiter, (110) would have proved a feeble restraint on the fierce temper of Maximian, whose passion was the love of power, and who neither desired present tranquillity nor future reputation.
 But he yielded, however reluctantly, to the ascendant which his wiser colleague had acquired over him, and retired immediately after his abdication to a villa in Lucania, where it was almost impossible that such an impatient spirit could find any lasting tranquillity.
 Retirement of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> at Salona.
 Diocletian, who, from a servile origin, had raised himself to the throne, passed the nine last years of his life in a private condition.
 Reason had dictated, and content seems to have accompanied, his retreat, in which he enjoyed for a long time the respect of those princes to whom he had resigned the possession of the world.
 (111) It is seldom that minds long exercised in business have formed any habits of conversing with themselves, and in the loss of power they principally regret the want of occupation.
 The amusements of letters and of devotion, which afford so many resources in solitude, were incapable of fixing the attention of Diocletian; but he had preserved, or at least he soon recovered, a taste for the most innocent as well as natural pleasures, and his leisure hours were sufficiently employed in building, planting, and gardening.
 His philosophy, His answer to <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> is deservedly celebrated.
 He was solicited by that restless old man to reassume the reins of government and the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> purple.
 He rejected the temptation with a smile of pity, calmly observing that, if he could show <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> the cabbages which he had planted with his own hands at Salona, he should no longer be urged to relinquish the enjoyment of happiness for the pursuit of power.
 (112) In his conversations with his friends he frequently acknowledged that of all arts the most difficult was the art of reigning; and he expressed himself on that favourite topic with a degree of warmth which could be the result only of experience.
 "How often," was he accustomed to say, "is it the interest of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> ministers to combine together to deceive their sovereign! Secluded from mankind by his exalted dignity, the truth is concealed from his knowledge; he can see only with their eyes, he hears nothing but their misrepresentations.
 He confers the most important offices upon vice and weakness, and disgraces the most virtuous and deserving among his subjects.
 By such infamous arts," added Diocletian, "the best and wisest princes are sold to the venal corruption of their courtiers.
" (113) A just estimate of greatness, and the assurance of immortal fame, improve our relish for the pleasures of retirement; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor had filled too important a character in the world to enjoy without alloy the comforts and security of a private condition.
 It was impossible that he could remain ignorant of the troubles which afflicted the empire after his abdication.
 It was impossible that he could be indifferent to their consequences.
 Fear, sorrow, and discontent sometimes pursued him into the solitude of Salona.
 His tenderness, or at least his pride, was deeply wounded by the misfortunes of his wife and daughter; and the last moments of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> were embittered by some affronts, which <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> might have spared the father of so many emperors, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> author of their own fortune.
 and death.
 A.
D.
 313.
 A report, though of a very doubtful nature, has reached our times that he prudently withdrew himself from their power by a voluntary death.
 (114) Description of <GPE>Salona</GPE> and the adjacent country.
 Before we dismiss the consideration of the life and character of Diocletian, we may for a moment direct our view to the place of his retirement.
 Salona, a principal city of his native province of Dalmatia, was near <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> miles (according to the measurement of the public highways) from <GPE>Aquileia</GPE> and the confines of Italy, and about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and seventy from Sirmium, the usual residence of the emperors whenever they visited the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier.
 (115) A miserable village still preserves the name of Salona; but so late as the sixteenth century the remains of a theatre, and a confused prospect of broken arches and marble columns, continued to attest its ancient splendour.
 (116) About six or seven miles from the city <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> constructed a magnificent palace, and we may infer, from the greatness of the work, how long he had meditated his design of abdicating the empire.
 The choice of a spot which united all that could contribute either to health or to luxury did not require the partiality of a native.
 "The soil was dry and fertile, the air is pure and wholesome, and, though extremely hot during the summer months, this country seldom feels those sultry and noxious winds to which the coasts of <LOC>Istria</LOC> and some parts of <GPE>Italy</GPE> are exposed.
 The views from the palace are no less beautiful than the soil and climate were inviting.
 Towards the west lies the fertile shore that stretches along the Adriatic, in which a number of small islands are scattered in such a manner as to give this part of the sea the appearance of a great lake.
 On the north side lies the bay, which led to the ancient city of Salona; and the country beyond it, appearing in sight, forms a proper contrast to that more extensive prospect of water which the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> presents both to the south and to the east.
 Towards the north the view is terminated by high and irregular mountains, situated at a proper distance, and in many places covered with villages, woods, and vineyards.
" (117) Of Diocletian's palace.
 Though Constantine, from a very obvious prejudice, affects to mention the palace of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> with contempt, (118) yet <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their successors, who could only see it in a neglected and mutilated state, celebrates its magnificence in terms of the highest admiration.
 (119) It covered an extent of ground consisting of between nine and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> acres.
 The form was quadrangular, flanked with <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> towers.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> of the sides were near six hundred, and the other <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> near seven hundred, feet in length.
 The whole was constructed of a beautiful freestone, extracted from the neighbouring quarries of Trau, or Tragutium, and very little inferior to marble itself.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> streets, intersecting each other at right angles, divided the several parts of this great edifice, and the approach to the principal apartment was from a very stately entrance, which is still denominated the Golden Gate.
 The approach was terminated by a peristylium of granite columns, on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> side of which we discover the square temple of Esculapius, on the other the octagon temple of Jupiter.
 The latter of those deities <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> revered as the patron of his fortunes, the former as the protector of his health.
 By comparing the present remains with the precepts of Vitruvius, the several parts of the building, the baths, bedchamber, the atrium, the basilica, and the Cyzicene, Corinthian, and <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> halls have been described with some degree of precision, or at least of probability.
 Their forms were various, their proportions just, but they were all attended with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> imperfections, very repugnant to our modern notions of taste and convenience.
 These stately rooms had neither windows nor chimneys.
 They were lighted from the top (for the building seems to have consisted of no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> story), and they received their heat by the help of pipes that were conveyed along the walls.
 The range of principal apartments was protected towards the south-west by a portico <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and seventeen feet long, which must have formed a very noble and delightful walk, when the beauties of painting and sculpture were added to those of the prospect.
 Decline of the arts.
 Had this magnificent edifice remained in a solitary country, it would have been exposed to the ravages of time; but it might, perhaps, have escaped the rapacious industry of man.
 The village of Aspalathus, (120) and, long afterwards, the provincial town of Spalatro, have grown out of its ruins.
 The Golden Gate now opens into the marketplace.
 St.
 John the Baptist has usurped the honours of Esculapius; and the temple of Jupiter, under the protection of the Virgin, is converted into the cathedral church.
 For this account of Diocletian's palace we are principally indebted to an ingenious artist of our own time and country, whom a very liberal curiosity carried into the heart of Dalmatia.
 (121) But there is room to suspect that the elegance of his designs and engraving has somewhat flattered the objects which it was their purpose to represent.
 We are informed by a more recent and very judicious traveller that the awful ruins of <GPE>Spalatro</GPE> are not less expressive of the decline of the arts than of the greatness of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire in the time of Diocletian.
 (122) If such was indeed the state of architecture, we must naturally believe that painting and sculpture had experienced a still more sensible decay.
 The practice of architecture is directed by a few general and even mechanical rules.
 But sculpture, and, above all, painting, propose to themselves the imitation not only of the forms of nature, but of the characters and passions of the human soul.
 In those sublime arts the dexterity of the hand is of little avail unless it is animated by fancy and guided by the most correct taste and observation.
 Of letters.
 It is almost unnecessary to remark that the civil distractions of the empire, the licence of the soldiers, the inroads of the barbarians, and the progress of despotism, had proved very unfavourable to genius, and even to learning.
 The succession of <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> princes restored the empire without restoring the sciences.
 Their military education was not calculated to inspire them with the love of letters; and even the mind of Diocletian, however active and capacious in business, was totally uninformed by study or speculation.
 The professions of law and physic are of such common use and certain profit that they will always secure a sufficient number of practitioners endowed with a reasonable degree of abilities and knowledge; but it does not appear that the students in those <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> faculties appeal to any celebrated masters who have flourished within that period.
 The voice of poetry was silent.
 History was reduced to dry and confused abridgments, alike destitute of amusement and instruction.
 A languid and affected eloquence was still retained in the pay and service of the emperors, who encouraged not any arts except those which contributed to the gratification of their pride or the defence of their power.
 (123) The new Platonists.
 The declining age of learning and of mankind is marked, however, by the rise and rapid progress of the new Platonists.
 The school of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> silenced those of Athens; and the ancient sects enrolled themselves under the banners of the more fashionable teachers, who recommended their system by the novelty of their method and the austerity of their manners.
 Several of these masters - Ammonius, Plotinus, Amelius, and <PERSON>Porphyry</PERSON> (124) - were men of profound thought and intense application; but, by mistaking the true object of philosophy, their labours contributed much less to improve than to corrupt the human understanding.
 The knowledge that is suited to our situation and powers, the whole compass of moral, natural, and mathematical science, was neglected by the new Platonists; whilst they exhausted their strength in the verbal disputes of metaphysics, attempted to explore the secrets of the invisible world, and studied to reconcile <PERSON>Aristotle</PERSON> with Plato, on subjects of which both these philosophers were as ignorant as the rest of mankind.
 Consuming their reason in these deep but unsubstantial meditations, their minds were exposed to illusions of fancy.
 They flattered themselves that they possessed the secret of disengaging the soul from its corporeal prison; claimed a familiar intercourse with daemons and spirits; and, by a very singular revolution, converted the study of philosophy into that of magic.
 The ancient sages had derided the popular superstition; after disguising its extravagance by the thin pretence of allegory, the disciples of <PERSON>Plotinus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Porphyry</PERSON> became its most zealous defenders.
 As they agreed with the <NORP>Christians</NORP> in a few mysterious points of faith, they attacked the remainder of their theological system with all the fury of civil war.
 The new <NORP>Platonists</NORP> would scarcely deserve a place in the history of science, but in that of the church the mention of them will very frequently occur.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The <LOC>West</LOC> » « Fall In The <LOC>East</LOC> » « Comments on the Fall » « Decline and Fall » Softening, however, his tone, <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> insinuated to the ambassador that it had never been the practice of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to trample on a prostrate enemy; and that, on this occasion, they should consult their own dignity rather than the <NORP>Persian</NORP> merit.
 He dismissed <PERSON>Apharban</PERSON> with a hope that <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> would soon be informed on what conditions he night obtain, from the clemency of the emperors, a lasting peace and the restoration of his wives and children.
 In this conference we may discover the fierce passions of Galerius, as well as his deference to the superior wisdom and authority of Diocletian.
 The ambition of the former grasped at the conquest of the East, and had proposed to reduce <GPE>Persia</GPE> into the state of a province.
 Moderation of Diocletian.
 The prudence of the latter, who adhered to the moderate policy of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and the Antonines, embraced the favourable opportunity of terminating a successful war by an honourable and advantageous peace.
 (75) Conclusion.
 In pursuance of their promise, the emperors soon afterwards appointed Sicorius Probus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their secretaries, to acquaint the <NORP>Persian</NORP> court with their final resolution.
 As the minister of peace, he was received with every mark of politeness and friendship; but, under the pretence of allowing him the necessary repose after so long a journey, the audience of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> was deferred from day to day, and he attended the slow motions of the king, till at length he was admitted to his presence, near the river Asprudus, in Media.
 The secret motive of <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> in this delay had been to collect such a military force as might enable him, though sincerely desirous of peace, to negotiate with the greater weight and dignity.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> persons only assisted at this important conference, the minister Apharban, the praefect of the guards, and an officer who had commanded on the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> frontier.
 (76) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> condition proposed by the ambassador is not at present of a very intelligible nature; that the city of <PRODUCT>Nisibis</PRODUCT> might be established for the place of mutual exchange, or, as we should formerly have termed it, for the staple of trade, between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires.
 There is no difficulty in conceiving the intention of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes to improve their revenue by some restraints upon commerce; but as <PRODUCT>Nisibis</PRODUCT> was situated within their own dominions, and as they were masters both of the imports and exports, it should seem that such restraints were the objects of an internal law, rather than of a foreign treaty.
 To render them more effectual, some stipulations were probably required on the side of the king of Persia, which appeared so very repugnant either to his interest or to his dignity that <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> could not be persuaded to subscribe them.
 As this was the only article to which he refused his consent, it was no longer insisted on; and the emperors either suffered the trade to flow in its natural channels, or contented themselves with such restrictions as it depended on their own authority to establish.
 And articles of the treaty As soon as this difficulty was removed, a solemn peace was concluded and ratified between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations.
 The conditions of a treaty so glorious to the empire, and so necessary to Persia, may deserve a more peculiar attention, as the history of <GPE>Rome</GPE> presents very few transactions of a similar nature; most of her wars having either been terminated by absolute conquest, or waged against barbarians ignorant of the use of letters.
The <PRODUCT>Aboras</PRODUCT> fixed as the limits between the empires.
 I.
 The Aboras, or, as it is called by Xenophon, the Araxes, was fixed as the boundary between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> monarchies.
 (77) That river, which rose near the Tigris, was increased, a few miles below Nisibis, by the little stream of the Mygdonius, passed under the walls of Singara, and fell into the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> at Circesium, a frontier town which, by the care of Diocletian, was very strongly fortified.
 (78) Mesopotamia, the object of so many wars, was ceded to the empire; and the Persians, by this treaty, renounced all pretensions to that great province II.
 They relinquished to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> provinces beyond the Tigris.
 (79)Cession of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> provinces beyond the Tigris.
 Their situation formed a very useful barrier, and their natural strength was soon improved by art and military skill.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> of these, to the north of the river, were districts of obscure fame and inconsiderable extent - Intiline, Zabdicene, Arzanene, and Moxoene; but on the east of the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> the empire acquired the large and mountainous territory of Carduene, the ancient seat of the Carduchians, who preserved for many ages their manly freedom in the heart of the despotic monarchies of Asia.
 The <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Greeks</NORP> traversed their country after a painful march, or rather engagement, of seven days; and it is confessed by their leader, in his incomparable relation of the retreat, that they suffered more from the arrows of the <NORP>Carduchians</NORP> than from the power of the Great King.
 (80) Their posterity, the Curds, with very little alteration either of name or manners, acknowledged the nominal sovereignty of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan.
 Armenia.
 III.
 It is almost needless to observe that Tiridates, the faithful ally of Rome, was restored to the throne of his fathers, and that the rights of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> supremacy were fully asserted and secured.
 The limits of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> were extended as far as the forests of <LOC>Sintha</LOC> in Media, and this increase of dominion was not so much an act of liberality as of justice.
 Of the provinces already mentioned beyond the Tigris, the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> had been dismembered by the <PERSON>Parthians</PERSON> from the crown of Armenia; (81) and when the <NORP>Romans</NORP> acquired the possession of them, they stipulated, at the expense of the usurpers, an ample compensation, which invested their ally with the extensive and fertile country of Atropatene.
 Its principal city, in the same situation perhaps as the modern Tauris, was frequently honoured with the residence of Tiridates; and as it sometimes bore the name of Ecbatana, he imitated, in the buildings and fortifications, the splendid capital of the Medes.
 (82)Iberia.
 IV.
 The country of <GPE>Iberia</GPE> was barren, its inhabitants rude and savage.
 But they were accustomed to the use of arms, and they separated from the empire barbarians much fiercer and more formidable than themselves.
 The narrow defiles of Mount Caucasus were in their hands, and it was in their choice either to admit or to exclude the wandering tribes of Sarmatia, whenever a rapacious spirit urged them to penetrate into the richer climates of the South.
 (83) The nomination of the kings of Iberia, which was resigned by the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch to the emperors, contributed to the strength and security of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> power in Asia.
 (84) The <LOC>East</LOC> enjoyed a profound tranquillity during forty years; and the treaty between the rival monarchies was strictly observed till the death of Tiridates; when a new generation, animated with different views and different passions, succeeded to the government of the world; and the grandson of <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> undertook a long and memorable war against the princes of the house of Constantine.
 Triumph of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> amd Maximian.
 A.
D.
 303.
 November <CARDINAL>20</CARDINAL> The arduous work of rescuing the distressed empire from tyrants and barbarians had now been completely achieved by a succession of <NORP>IIlyrian</NORP> peasants.
 As soon as <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> entered into the twentieth year of his reign, he celebrated that memorable era, as well as the success of his arms by the pomp of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> triumph.
 (85) Maximian, the equal partner of his power, was his only companion in the glory of that day.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> had fought and conquered, but the merit of their exploits was ascribed, according to the rigour of ancient maxims, to the auspicious influence of their fathers and emperors.
 (86) The triumph of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> was less magnificent, perhaps, than those of <PERSON>Aurelian</PERSON> and Probus, but it was dignified by several circumstances of superior fame and good fortune.
 <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Britain, the Rhine, the Danube, and the Nile, furnished their respective trophies; but the most distinguished ornament was of a more singular nature, a <NORP>Persian</NORP> victory followed by an important conquest.
 The representations of rivers, mountains, and provinces were carried before the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> car.
 The images of the captive wives, the sisters, and the children of the Great <PERSON>King</PERSON> afforded a new and grateful spectacle to the vanity of the people.
 (87) In the eyes of posterity this triumph is remarkable by a distinction of a less honourable kind.
 It was the last that <GPE>Rome</GPE> ever beheld.
 Soon after this period the emperors ceased to vanquish, and <GPE>Rome</GPE> ceased to be the capital of the empire.
 Long absence of the emperor from <GPE>Rome</GPE> .
 The spot on which <GPE>Rome</GPE> was founded had been consecrated by ancient ceremonies and imaginary miracles.
 The presence of some god, or the memory of some hero, seemed to animate every part of the city, and the empire of the world had been promised to the Capitol.
 (88) The native <NORP>Romans</NORP> felt and confessed the power of this agreeable illusion.
 It was derived from their ancestors, had grown up with their earliest habits of life, and was protected, in some measure, by the opinion of political utility.
 The form and the seat of government were intimately blended together, nor was it esteemed possible to transport the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> without destroying the other.
 (89) But the sovereignty of the capital was gradually annihilated in the extent of conquest; the provinces rose to the same level, and the vanquished nations acquired the name and privileges, without imbibing the partial affections, of Romans.
 During a long period, however, the remains of the ancient constitution and the influence of custom preserved the dignity of Rome.
 The emperors, though perhaps of <NORP>African</NORP> or <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> extraction, respected their adopted country as the seat of their power and the centre of their extensive dominions.
 The emergencies of war very frequently required their presence on the Frontiers; but <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes who fixed, in time of peace, their ordinary residence in the provinces and their conduct, however it might be suggested by private motives, was justified by very specious considerations of policy.
Their residence at Milan.
 The court of the emperor of the <LOC>West</LOC> was, for the most part, established at Milan, whose situation, at the foot of the Alps, appeared far more convenient than that of Rome, for the important purpose of watching the motions of the barbarians of Germany.
 <GPE>Milan</GPE> soon assumed the splendour of an imperial city.
 The houses are described as numerous and well built; the manners of the people as polished and liberal.
 A circus, a theatre, a mint, a palace, baths, which bore the name of their founder Maximian; porticoes adorned with statues, and a double circumference of walls, contributed to the beauty of the new capital.
 Nor did it seem oppressed even by the proximity of Rome.
 (90) To rival the majesty of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was the ambition likewise of Diocletian, and Nicomedia.
 who employed his leisure and the wealth of the <LOC>East</LOC> in the embellishment of Nicomedia, a city placed on the verge of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, almost at an equal distance between the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the Euphrates.
 By the taste of the monarch, and at the expense of the people, <GPE>Nicomedia</GPE> acquired, in he space of a few years, a degree of magnificence which might appear to have required the labour of ages, and became inferior only to Rome, Alexandria, and <GPE>Antioch</GPE> in extent or populousness.
 (91) The life of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> was a life of action, and a considerable portion of it was spent in camps, or in their long and frequent marches; but whenever the public business allowed them any relaxation, they seemed to have retired with pleasure to their favourite residences of <GPE>Nicomedia</GPE> and Milan.
 Till Diocletian, in the twentieth year of his reign, celebrated his <NORP>Roman</NORP> triumph, it is extremely doubtful whether he ever visited the ancient capital of the empire.
 Even on that memorable occasion his stay did not exceed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months.
 Disgusted with the licentious familiarity of the people, he quitted <GPE>Rome</GPE> with precipitation thirteen days before it was expected that he should have appeared in the senate invested with the ensigns of the consular dignity.
 (92) Debasement of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of the senate.
 The dislike expressed by <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> towards <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <NORP>Roman</NORP> freedom was not the effect of momentary caprice, but the result of the most artful policy.
 The crafty prince had framed a new system of <ORG>Imperial</ORG> government, which was afterwards completed by the family of Constantine; and as the image of the old constitution was religiously preserved in the senate, he resolved to deprive that order of its small remains of power and consideration.
 We may recollect, about eight years before the elevation of Diocletian, the transient greatness and the ambitious hopes of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 As long as that enthusiasm prevailed, many of the nobles imprudently displayed their zeal in the cause of freedom; and after the successors of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> had withdrawn their countenance from the <NORP>republican</NORP> party, the senators were unable to disguise their impotent resentment.
 As the sovereign of Italy, <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> was intrusted with the care of extinguishing this troublesome rather than dangerous spirit, and the task was perfectly suited to his cruel temper.
 The most illustrious members of the senate, whom <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> always affected to esteem, were involved, by his colleague, in the accusation of imaginary plots; and the possession of an elegant villa, or a well-cultivated estate, was interpreted as a convincing evidence of guilt.
 (93) The camp of the Praetorians, which had so long oppressed, began to protect, the majesty of Rome; and as those haughty troops were conscious of the decline of their power, they were naturally disposed to unite their strength with the authority of the senate.
 By the prudent measures of Diocletian, the numbers of the <NORP>Praetorians</NORP> were insensibly reduced, their privileges abolished, (94) and their place supplied by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> faithful legions of Illyricum, New bodies of guards, <NORP>Jovians</NORP> and Herculians.
 who, under the new titles of <NORP>Jovians</NORP> and Herculians, were appointed to perform the service of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> guards.
 (95) But the most fatal though secret wound which the senate received from the hands of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> was inflicted by the inevitable operation of their absence.
 As long as the emperors resided at Rome, that assembly might be oppressed, but it could scarcely be neglected.
 The successors of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> exercised the power of dictating whatever laws their wisdom or caprice might suggest; but those laws were ratified by the sanction of the senate.
 The model of ancient freedom was preserved in its deliberations and decrees; and wise princes, who respected the prejudices of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, were in some measure obliged to assume the language and behaviour suitable to the general and <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate of the republic.
 In the armies and in the provinces they displayed the dignity of monarchs; and when they fixed their residence at a distance from the capital, they forever laid aside the dissimulation which <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> had recommended to his successors.
 In the exercise of the legislative as well as the executive power, the sovereign advised with his ministers, instead of consulting the great council of the nation.
 The name of the senate was mentioned with honour till the last period of the empire; the vanity of its members was still flattered with honorary distinctions; (96) but the assembly which had so long been the source, and so long the instrument of power, was respectfully suffered to sink into oblivion.
 The senate of Rome, losing all connection with the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court and the actual constitution, was left a venerable but useless monument of antiquity on the Capitoline hill.
 Civil magistrates laid aside.
 When the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes had lost sight of the senate and of their ancient capital, they easily forgot the origin and nature of their legal power.
 The civil offices of consul, of proconsul, of censor, and of tribune, by the union of which it had been formed, betrayed to the people its <NORP>republican</NORP> extraction.
 Those modest titles were laid aside; (97) and if they still distinguished their high station by the appellation of Emperor, or IMPERATOR, that word was understood in a new and more dignified sense, and no longer denoted the general of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies, but the sovereign of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 <ORG>Imperial</ORG> dignity and titles.
 The name of Emperor, which was at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of a military nature, was associated with another of a more servile kind.
 The epithet of DOMINUS, or LORD, in its primitive signification, was expressive not of the authority of a prince over his subjects, or of a commander over his soldiers, but of the despotic power of a master over his domestic slaves.
 (98) Viewing it in that odious light, it had been rejected with abhorrence by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Caesars.
 Their resistance insensibly became more feeble, and the name less odious; till at length the style of our Lord and <PERSON>Emperor</PERSON> was not only bestowed by flattery, but was regularly admitted into the laws and public monuments.
 Such lofty epithets were sufficient to elate and satisfy the most excessive vanity; and if the successors of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> still declined the title of King, it seems to have been the effect not so much of their moderation as of their delicacy.
 Wherever the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> tongue was in use (and it was the language of government throughout the empire), the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> title, as it was peculiar to themselves, conveyed a more respectable idea than the name of king, which they must have shared with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> barbarian chieftains; or which, at the best, they could derive only from Romulus, or from Tarquin.
 But the sentiments of the <LOC>East</LOC> were very different from those of the West.
 From the earliest period of history, the sovereigns of <LOC>Asia</LOC> had been celebrated in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language by the title of BASILEUS, or King; and since it was considered as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> distinction among men, it was soon employed by the servile provincials of the <LOC>East</LOC> in their humble addresses to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> throne.
 (99) Even the attributes, or at least the titles, of the DIVINITY were usurped by <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and Maximian, who transmitted them to a succession of <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperors.
 (100) Such extravagant compliments, however, soon lose their impiety by losing their meaning; and when the ear is once accustomed to the sound, they are heard with indifference as vague though excessive professions of respect.
 <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> assumes the diadem, and introduces the <NORP>Persian</NORP> ceremonial.
 From the time of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to that of Diocletian, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes, conversing in a familiar manner among their fellow-citizens, were saluted only with the same respect that was usually paid to senators and magistrates.
 Their principal distinction was the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> or military robe of purple; whilst the senatorial garment was marked by a broad, and the equestrian by a narrow, band or stripe of the same honourable colour.
 The pride, or rather the policy, of Diocletian, engaged that artful prince to introduce the stately magnificence of the court of Persia.
 (101) He ventured to assume the diadem, an ornament detested by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> as the odious ensign of royalty, and the use of which had been considered as the most desperate act of the madness of Caligula.
 It was no more than a broad white fillet set with pearls, which encircled the emperor's head.
 The sumptuous robes of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and his successors were of silk and gold; and it is remarked with indignation that even their shoes were studded with the most precious gems.
 The access to their sacred person was every day rendered more difficult by the institution of new forms and ceremonies.
 The avenues of the palace were strictly guarded by the various schools, as they began to be called, of domestic officers.
 The interior apartments were intrusted to the jealous vigilance of the eunuchs; the increase of whose numbers and influence was the most infallible symptom of the progress of despotism.
 When a subject was at length admitted to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> presence, he was obliged, whatever might be his rank, to fall prostrate on the ground, and to adore, according to the eastern fashion, the divinity of his lord and master.
 (102) <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was a man of sense, who, in the course of private as well as public life, had formed a just estimate both of himself and of mankind: nor is it easy to conceive that in substituting the manners of <GPE>Persia</GPE> to those of <GPE>Rome</GPE> he was seriously actuated by so mean a principle as that of vanity.
 He flattered himself that an ostentation of splendour and luxury would subdue the imagination of the multitude; that the monarch would be less exposed to the rude licence of the people and the soldiers, as his person was secluded from the public view; and that habits of submission would insensibly be productive of sentiments of veneration.
 Like the modesty affected by Augustus, the state maintained by <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was a theatrical representation; but it must be confessed that, of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> comedies, the former was of a much more liberal and manly character than the latter.
 It was the aim of the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> to disguise, and the object of the other to display, the unbounded power which the emperors possessed over the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 New form of administration, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Augusti, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Caesars.
 Ostentation was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> principle of the new system instituted by Diocletian.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> was division.
 He divided the empire, the provinces, and every branch of the civil as well as military administration.
 He multiplied the wheels of the machine of government, and rendered its operations less rapid but more secure.
 Whatever advantages and whatever defects might attend these innovations, they must be ascribed in a very great degree to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> inventor, but as the new frame of policy was gradually improved and completed by succeeding princes, it will be more satisfactory to delay the consideration of it till the season of its full maturity and perfection.
 (103) Reserving, therefore, for the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> a more exact picture of the new empire, we shall content ourselves with describing the principal and decisive outline, as it was traced by the hand of Diocletian.
 He had associated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> colleagues in the exercise of the supreme power; and as he was convinced that the abilities of a single man were inadequate to the public defence, he considered the joint administration of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> princes not as a temporary expedient, but as a fundamental law of the constitution.
 It was his intention that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> elder princes should be distinguished by the use of the diadem and the title of Augusti; that, as affection or esteem might direct their choice, they should regularly call to their assistance <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> subordinate colleagues; and that the Caesars, rising in their turn to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rank, should supply an uninterrupted succession of emperors.
 The empire was divided into <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> parts.
 The <LOC>East</LOC> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> were the most honourable, the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> the most laborious stations.
 The former claimed the presence of the Augusti, the latter were intrusted to the administration of the Caesars.
 The strength of the legions was in the hands of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> partners of sovereignty, and the despair of successively vanquishing <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> formidable rivals might intimidate the ambition of an aspiring general.
 In their civil government the emperors were supposed to exercise the undivided power of the monarch, and their edicts, inscribed with their joint names, were received in all the provinces as promulgated by their mutual councils and authority.
 Notwithstanding these precautions, the political union of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world was gradually dissolved, and a principle of division was introduced, which, in the course of a few years, occasioned the perpetual separation of the eastern and western empires.
 Increase of taxes.
 The system of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was accompanied with another very material disadvantage, which cannot even at present be totally overlooked; a more expensive establishment, and consequently an increase of taxes, and the oppression of the people.
 Instead of a modest family of slaves and freedmen, such as had contented the simple greatness of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> magnificent courts were established in the various parts of the empire, and as many <NORP>Roman</NORP> kings contended with each other and with the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch for the vain superiority of pomp and luxury.
 The number of ministers, of magistrates, of officers, and of servants, who filled the different departments of the state, was multiplied beyond the example of former times; and (if we may borrow the warm expression of a contemporary), From this period to the extinction of the empire, it would be easy to deduce an uninterrupted series of clamours and complaints.
 According to his religion and situation, each writer chooses either Diocletian, or Constantine, or Valens, or Theodosius, for the object of his invectives; but they unanimously agree in representing the burden of the public impositions, and particularly the land-tax and capitation, as the intolerable and increasing grievance of their own times.
 From such a concurrence, an impartial historian, who is obliged to extract truth from satire, as well as from panegyric, will be inclined to divide the blame among the princes whom they accuse, and to ascribe their exactions much less to their personal vices than to the uniform system of their administration.
 The emperor <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was indeed the author of that system; but during his reign the growing evil was confined within the bounds of modesty and discretion, and he deserves the reproach of establishing pernicious precedents, rather than of exercising actual oppression.
 (105) It may be added, that his revenues were managed with prudent economy; and that, after all the current expenses were discharged, there still remained in the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> treasury an ample provision either for judicious liberality or for any emergency of the state.
 Abdication of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and Maximian.
 It was in the twenty <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> year of his reign that <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> executed his memorable resolution of abdicating the empire; an action more naturally to have been expected from the elder or the younger <PERSON>Antoninus</PERSON> than from a prince who had never practised the lessons of philosophy either in the attainment or in the use of supreme power.
 <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> acquired the glory of giving to the world the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> example of a resignation (106) which has not been very frequently imitated by succeeding monarchs.
 Resemblance to <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the Fifth.
 The parallel of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the Fifth, however, will naturally offer itself to our mind, not only since the eloquence of a modern historian has rendered that name so familiar to an <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> reader, but from the very striking resemblance between the characters of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, whose political abilities were superior to their military genius, and whose specious virtues were much less the effect of nature than of art.
 The abdication of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> appears to have been hastened by the vicissitude of fortune; and the disappointment of his favourite schemes urged him to relinquish a power which he found inadequate to his ambition.
 But the reign of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> had flowed with a; tide of uninterrupted success; nor was it till after he had vanquished all his enemies, and accomplished all his designs, that he seems to have entertained any serious thoughts of resigning the empire.
 Neither <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> nor <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> were arrived at a very advanced period of life; since the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> was only fifty-five, and the other was no more than fifty-nine years of age; but the active life of those princes, their wars and journeys, the cares of royalty, and their application to business, had already impaired their constitution, and brought on the infirmities of a premature old age.

 Long illness of Diocletian.
 Notwithstanding the severity of a very cold and rainy winter, <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> left <GPE>Italy</GPE> soon after the ceremony of his triumph, and began his progress towards the <LOC>East</LOC> round the circuit of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> provinces.
 From the inclemency of the weather and the fatigue of the journey, he soon contracted a slow illness; and though he made easy marches, and was generally carried in a close litter, his disorder, before he arrived at Nicomedia, about the end of the summer, was become very serious and alarming.
 During the whole winter he was confined to his palace; his danger inspired a general and unaffected concern; but the people could only judge of the various alterations of his health from the joy or consternation which they discovered in the countenances and behaviour of his attendants.
 The rumour of his death was for some time universally believed, and it was supposed to be concealed with a view to prevent the troubles that might have happened during the absence of the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> Galerius.
 At length, however, on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of March, <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> once more appeared in public, but so pale and emaciated that he could scarcely have been recognised by those to whom his person was the most familiar.
 His prudence.
 It was time to put an end to the painful struggle, which he had sustained during more than a year, between the care of his health and that of his dignity.
 The former required indulgence and relaxation, the latter compelled him to direct, from the bed of sickness, the administration of a great empire.
 He resolved to pass the remainder of his days in honourable repose, to place his glory beyond the reach of fortune, and to relinquish the theatre of the world to his younger and more active associates.
 (108) A.

 305.
 May <CARDINAL>1</CARDINAL> The ceremony of his abdication was performed in a spacious plain, about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles from Nicomedia.
 The emperor ascended a lofty throne, and, in a speech full of reason and dignity, declared his intention, both to the people and to the soldiers who were assembled on this extraordinary occasion.
 As soon as he had divested himself of the purple, he withdrew from the gazing multitude, and, traversing the city in a covered chariot, proceeded without delay to the favourite retirement which he had chosen in his native country of Dalmatia.
 On the same day, which was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of May, (109) Compliance of Maximian.
 Maximian, as it had been previously concerted, made his resignation of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> dignity at Milan.
 Even in the splendour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> triumph, <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> had meditated his design of abdicating the government.
 As he wished to secure the obedience of Maximian, he exacted from him either a general assurance that he would submit his actions to the authority of his benefactor, or a particular promise that he would descend from the throne whenever he should receive the advice and the example.
 This engagement, though it was confirmed by the solemnity of an oath before the altar of the Capitoline Jupiter, (110) would have proved a feeble restraint on the fierce temper of Maximian, whose passion was the love of power, and who neither desired present tranquillity nor future reputation.
 But he yielded, however reluctantly, to the ascendant which his wiser colleague had acquired over him, and retired immediately after his abdication to a villa in Lucania, where it was almost impossible that such an impatient spirit could find any lasting tranquillity.
 Retirement of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> at Salona.
 Diocletian, who, from a servile origin, had raised himself to the throne, passed the nine last years of his life in a private condition.
 Reason had dictated, and content seems to have accompanied, his retreat, in which he enjoyed for a long time the respect of those princes to whom he had resigned the possession of the world.
 (111) It is seldom that minds long exercised in business have formed any habits of conversing with themselves, and in the loss of power they principally regret the want of occupation.
 The amusements of letters and of devotion, which afford so many resources in solitude, were incapable of fixing the attention of Diocletian; but he had preserved, or at least he soon recovered, a taste for the most innocent as well as natural pleasures, and his leisure hours were sufficiently employed in building, planting, and gardening.
 His philosophy, His answer to <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> is deservedly celebrated.
 He was solicited by that restless old man to reassume the reins of government and the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> purple.
 He rejected the temptation with a smile of pity, calmly observing that, if he could show <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> the cabbages which he had planted with his own hands at Salona, he should no longer be urged to relinquish the enjoyment of happiness for the pursuit of power.
 (112) In his conversations with his friends he frequently acknowledged that of all arts the most difficult was the art of reigning; and he expressed himself on that favourite topic with a degree of warmth which could be the result only of experience.
 A just estimate of greatness, and the assurance of immortal fame, improve our relish for the pleasures of retirement; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor had filled too important a character in the world to enjoy without alloy the comforts and security of a private condition.
 It was impossible that he could remain ignorant of the troubles which afflicted the empire after his abdication.
 It was impossible that he could be indifferent to their consequences.
 Fear, sorrow, and discontent sometimes pursued him into the solitude of Salona.
 His tenderness, or at least his pride, was deeply wounded by the misfortunes of his wife and daughter; and the last moments of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> were embittered by some affronts, which <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> might have spared the father of so many emperors, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> author of their own fortune.
 and death.

 A report, though of a very doubtful nature, has reached our times that he prudently withdrew himself from their power by a voluntary death.
 (114) Description of <GPE>Salona</GPE> and the adjacent country.
 Before we dismiss the consideration of the life and character of Diocletian, we may for a moment direct our view to the place of his retirement.
 Salona, a principal city of his native province of Dalmatia, was near <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> miles (according to the measurement of the public highways) from <GPE>Aquileia</GPE> and the confines of Italy, and about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and seventy from Sirmium, the usual residence of the emperors whenever they visited the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier.
 (115) A miserable village still preserves the name of Salona; but so late as the sixteenth century the remains of a theatre, and a confused prospect of broken arches and marble columns, continued to attest its ancient splendour.
 (116) About six or seven miles from the city <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> constructed a magnificent palace, and we may infer, from the greatness of the work, how long he had meditated his design of abdicating the empire.
 The choice of a spot which united all that could contribute either to health or to luxury did not require the partiality of a native.
Of Diocletian's palace.
 Though Constantine, from a very obvious prejudice, affects to mention the palace of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> with contempt, (118) yet <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their successors, who could only see it in a neglected and mutilated state, celebrates its magnificence in terms of the highest admiration.
 (119) It covered an extent of ground consisting of between nine and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> acres.
 The form was quadrangular, flanked with <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> towers.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> of the sides were near six hundred, and the other <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> near seven hundred, feet in length.
 The whole was constructed of a beautiful freestone, extracted from the neighbouring quarries of Trau, or Tragutium, and very little inferior to marble itself.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> streets, intersecting each other at right angles, divided the several parts of this great edifice, and the approach to the principal apartment was from a very stately entrance, which is still denominated the Golden Gate.
 The approach was terminated by a peristylium of granite columns, on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> side of which we discover the square temple of Esculapius, on the other the octagon temple of Jupiter.
 The latter of those deities <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> revered as the patron of his fortunes, the former as the protector of his health.
 By comparing the present remains with the precepts of Vitruvius, the several parts of the building, the baths, bedchamber, the atrium, the basilica, and the Cyzicene, Corinthian, and <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> halls have been described with some degree of precision, or at least of probability.
 Their forms were various, their proportions just, but they were all attended with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> imperfections, very repugnant to our modern notions of taste and convenience.
 These stately rooms had neither windows nor chimneys.
 They were lighted from the top (for the building seems to have consisted of no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> story), and they received their heat by the help of pipes that were conveyed along the walls.
 The range of principal apartments was protected towards the south-west by a portico <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and seventeen feet long, which must have formed a very noble and delightful walk, when the beauties of painting and sculpture were added to those of the prospect.
 Decline of the arts.
 Had this magnificent edifice remained in a solitary country, it would have been exposed to the ravages of time; but it might, perhaps, have escaped the rapacious industry of man.
 The village of Aspalathus, (120) and, long afterwards, the provincial town of Spalatro, have grown out of its ruins.
 The Golden Gate now opens into the marketplace.
 St.
 John the Baptist has usurped the honours of Esculapius; and the temple of Jupiter, under the protection of the Virgin, is converted into the cathedral church.
 For this account of Diocletian's palace we are principally indebted to an ingenious artist of our own time and country, whom a very liberal curiosity carried into the heart of Dalmatia.
 (121) But there is room to suspect that the elegance of his designs and engraving has somewhat flattered the objects which it was their purpose to represent.
 We are informed by a more recent and very judicious traveller that the awful ruins of <GPE>Spalatro</GPE> are not less expressive of the decline of the arts than of the greatness of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire in the time of Diocletian.
 (122) If such was indeed the state of architecture, we must naturally believe that painting and sculpture had experienced a still more sensible decay.
 The practice of architecture is directed by a few general and even mechanical rules.
 But sculpture, and, above all, painting, propose to themselves the imitation not only of the forms of nature, but of the characters and passions of the human soul.
 In those sublime arts the dexterity of the hand is of little avail unless it is animated by fancy and guided by the most correct taste and observation.
 Of letters.
 It is almost unnecessary to remark that the civil distractions of the empire, the licence of the soldiers, the inroads of the barbarians, and the progress of despotism, had proved very unfavourable to genius, and even to learning.
 The succession of <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> princes restored the empire without restoring the sciences.
 Their military education was not calculated to inspire them with the love of letters; and even the mind of Diocletian, however active and capacious in business, was totally uninformed by study or speculation.
 The professions of law and physic are of such common use and certain profit that they will always secure a sufficient number of practitioners endowed with a reasonable degree of abilities and knowledge; but it does not appear that the students in those <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> faculties appeal to any celebrated masters who have flourished within that period.
 The voice of poetry was silent.
 History was reduced to dry and confused abridgments, alike destitute of amusement and instruction.
 A languid and affected eloquence was still retained in the pay and service of the emperors, who encouraged not any arts except those which contributed to the gratification of their pride or the defence of their power.
 (123) The new Platonists.
 The declining age of learning and of mankind is marked, however, by the rise and rapid progress of the new Platonists.
 The school of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> silenced those of Athens; and the ancient sects enrolled themselves under the banners of the more fashionable teachers, who recommended their system by the novelty of their method and the austerity of their manners.
 Several of these masters - Ammonius, Plotinus, Amelius, and <PERSON>Porphyry</PERSON> (124) - were men of profound thought and intense application; but, by mistaking the true object of philosophy, their labours contributed much less to improve than to corrupt the human understanding.
 The knowledge that is suited to our situation and powers, the whole compass of moral, natural, and mathematical science, was neglected by the new Platonists; whilst they exhausted their strength in the verbal disputes of metaphysics, attempted to explore the secrets of the invisible world, and studied to reconcile <PERSON>Aristotle</PERSON> with Plato, on subjects of which both these philosophers were as ignorant as the rest of mankind.
 Consuming their reason in these deep but unsubstantial meditations, their minds were exposed to illusions of fancy.
 They flattered themselves that they possessed the secret of disengaging the soul from its corporeal prison; claimed a familiar intercourse with daemons and spirits; and, by a very singular revolution, converted the study of philosophy into that of magic.
 The ancient sages had derided the popular superstition; after disguising its extravagance by the thin pretence of allegory, the disciples of <PERSON>Plotinus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Porphyry</PERSON> became its most zealous defenders.
 As they agreed with the <NORP>Christians</NORP> in a few mysterious points of faith, they attacked the remainder of their theological system with all the fury of civil war.
 The new <NORP>Platonists</NORP> would scarcely deserve a place in the history of science, but in that of the church the mention of them will very frequently occur.
