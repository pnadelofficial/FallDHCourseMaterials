The Motives, Progress, and Effects of the Conversion of Constantine.
—Legal Establishment and Constitution of the Christian, or Catholic, <ORG>Church</ORG> THE public establishment of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> may be considered as <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most important and domestic revolutions which excite the most lively curiosity, and afford the most valuable instruction.
 The victories and the civil policy of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> no longer influence the state of Europe; but a considerable portion of the globe still retains the impression which it received from the conversion of that monarch; and the ecclesiastical institutions of his reign are still connected, by an indissoluble chain, with the opinions, the passions, and the interests of the present generation.
Date of the conversion of Constantine.
 A.
D.
 306 In the consideration of a subject which may be examined with impartiality, but cannot be viewed with indifference, a difficulty immediately arises of a very unexpected nature — that of ascertaining the real and precise date of the conversion of Constantine.
 The eloquent Lactantius, in the midst of his court.
 seems impatient(1) to proclaim to the world the glorious example of the sovereign of Gaul; who, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> moments of his reign, acknowledged and adored the majesty of the true and only God.
(2) The learned <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> has ascribed the faith of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to the miraculous sign which was displayed in A.
D.
 312.
 the heavens whilst he meditated and prepared the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 (3) The historian <PERSON>Zosimus</PERSON> maliciously asserts that the emperor had imbrued his hands in the blood of his eldest son before he publicly A.
D.
 326.
 renounced the gods of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of his ancestors.
(4) The perplexity produced by these discordant authorities is derived from the behaviour of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> himself.
 According to the strictness of ecclesiastical language, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperors was unworthy of that name till the moment of his death; since it was only during his last illness that he A.
D.
 337.
 received, as a catechumen, the imposition of hands,(5) and was afterwards admitted, by the initiatory rites of baptism, into the number of the faithful.
 (6) The <NORP>Christianity</NORP> of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> must be allowed in a much more vague and qualified sense; and the nicest accuracy is required in tracing the slow and almost imperceptible gradations by which the monarch declared himself the protector, and at length the proselyte, of the church.
 It was an arduous task to eradicate the habits and prejudices of his education, to acknowledge the divine power of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and to understand that the truth of his revelation was incompatible with the worship of the gods.
 The obstacles which he had probably experienced in his own mind instructed him to proceed with caution in the momentous change of a national religion; and he insensibly discovered his new opinions, as far as he could enforce them with safety and with effect.
 During the whole course of his reign, the stream of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> flowed with a gentle, though accelerated, motion: but its general direction was sometimes checked, and sometimes diverted by the accidental circumstances of the times, and by the prudence, or possibly by the caprice, of the monarch.
 His ministers were permitted to signify the intentions of their master in the various language which was best adapted to their respective principles; (7) and he artfully balanced the hopes and fears of his subjects, by publishing in the same year <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> edicts; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of A.
D.
 321.
 which enjoined the solemn observance of Sunday, (8) and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> directed the regular consultation of the Aruspices.
 (9) While this important revolution yet remained in suspense, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> watched the conduct of their sovereign with the same anxiety, but with very opposite sentiments.
 The former were prompted by every motive of zeal, as well as vanity, to exaggerate the marks of his favour and the evidences of his faith.
 The latter, till their just apprehensions were changed into despair and resentment, attempted to conceal from the world, and from themselves, that the gods of <GPE>Rome</GPE> could no longer reckon the emperor in the number of their votaries.
 The same passions and prejudices have engaged the partial writers of the times to connect the public profession of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> with the most glorious or the most ignominious era of the reign of Constantine.
 His <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition.
 Whatever symptoms of <NORP>Christian</NORP> piety might transpire in the discourses or actions of Constantine, he persevered till he was near forty years of age in the practice of the established religion;(10) and the same conduct which in the court of <PERSON>Nicomedia</PERSON> might be imputed to his fear, could be ascribed only to the inclination or policy of the sovereign of Gaul.
 His liberality restored and enriched the temples of the gods; the medals which issued from his <ORG>Imperial</ORG> mint are impressed with the figures and attributes of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> and Apollo, of <LOC>Mars</LOC> and Hercules; and his filial piety increased the council of <LOC>Olympus</LOC> by the solemn apotheosis of his father Constantius.
(11) But the devotion of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was more peculiarly directed to the genius of the Sun, the <LOC>Apollo</LOC> of <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Roman</NORP> mythology; and he was pleased to be represented with the symbols of the God of Light and Poetry.
 The unerring shafts of that deity, the brightness of his eyes, his laurel wreath, immortal beauty, and elegant accomplishments, seem to point him out as the patron of a young hero.
 The altars of <LOC>Apollo</LOC> were crowned with the votive offerings of Constantine; and the credulous multitude were taught to believe that the emperor was permitted to behold with mortal eyes the visible majesty of their tutelar deity; and that, either waking or in a vision, he was blessed with the auspicious omens of a long and victorious reign.
 The <PERSON>Sun</PERSON> was universally celebrated as the invincible guide and protector of Constantine; and the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> might reasonably expect that the insulted god would pursue with unrelenting vengeance the impiety of his ungrateful favourite.
(12) He protects the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of Gaul.
 A.
D.
 306-312.
 As long as <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> exercised a limited sovereignty over the provinces of Gaul, his <NORP>Christian</NORP> subjects were protected by the authority, and perhaps by the laws, of a prince who wisely left to the gods the care of vindicating their own honour.
 If we may credit the assertion of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> himself, he had been an indignant spectator of the savage cruelties which were inflicted, by the hands of <NORP>Roman</NORP> soldiers, on those citizens whose religion was their only crime.
(13) In the <LOC>East</LOC> and in the <LOC>West</LOC> he had seen the different effects of severity and indulgence; and as the former was rendered still more odious by the example of Galerius, his implacable enemy, the latter was recommended to his imitation by the authority and advice of a dying father.
 The son of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> immediately suspended or repealed the edicts of persecution, and granted the free exercise of their religious ceremonies to all those who had already professed themselves members of the church.
 They were soon encouraged to depend on the favour as well as on the justice of their sovereign, who had imbibed a secret and sincere reverence for the name of Christ, and for the God of the Christians.
(14) Edict of Milan.
 A.
D.
 313, March.
 About five months after the conquest of Italy, the emperor made a solemn and authentic declaration of his sentiments by the celebrated edict of Milan, which restored peace to the catholic church.
 In the personal interview of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> western princes, Constantine, by the ascendant of genius and power, obtained the ready concurrence of his colleague, Licinius; the union of their names and authority disarmed the fury of Maximin; and, after the death of the tyrant of the East, the edict of <GPE>Milan</GPE> was received as a general and fundamental law of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
(15) The wisdom of the emperors provided for the restitution of all the civil and religious rights of which the <NORP>Christians</NORP> had been so unjustly deprived.
 It was enacted that the places of worship, and public lands, which had been confiscated, should be restored to the church, without dispute, without delay, and without expense: and this severe injunction was accompanied with a gracious promise, that, if any of the purchasers had paid a fair and adequate price, they should be indemnified from the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> treasury.
 The salutary regulations which guard the future tranquillity of the faithful are framed on the principles of enlarged and equal toleration; and such an equality must have been interpreted by a recent sect as an advantageous and honourable distinction.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors proclaim to the world that they have granted a free and absolute power to the Christians, and to all others, of following the religion which each individual thinks proper to prefer, to which he has addicted his mind, and which he may deem the best adapted to his own use.
 They carefully explain every ambiguous word, remove every exception, and exact from the governors of the provinces a strict obedience to the true and simple meaning of an edict which was designed to establish and secure, without any limitation, the claims of religious liberty.
 They condescend to assign <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> weighty reasons which have induced them to allow this universal toleration: the humane intention of consulting the peace and happiness of their people; and the pious hope that by such a conduct they shall appease and propitiate the Deity, whose seat is in heaven.
 They gratefully acknowledge the many signal proofs which they have received of the divine favour; and they trust that the same <GPE>Providence</GPE> will for ever continue to protect the prosperity of the prince and people.
 From these vague and indefinite expressions of piety <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> suppositions may be deduced, of a different, but not of an incompatible nature.
 The mind of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> might fluctuate between the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> and the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religions.
 According to the loose and complying notions of Polytheism, he might acknowledge the God of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> as <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the many deities who compose the hierarchy of heaven.
 Or perhaps he might embrace the philosophic and pleasing idea that, notwithstanding the variety of names, of rites, and of opinions, all the sects and all the nations of mankind are united in the worship of the common Father and Creator of the universe.
(16) Use and beauty of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> morality.
 But the counsels of princes are more frequently influenced by views of temporal advantage than by considerations of abstract and speculative truth.
 The partial and increasing favour of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> may naturally be referred to the esteem which he entertained for the moral character of the Christians, and to a persuasion that the propagation of the <ORG>Gospel</ORG> would inculcate the practice of private and public virtue.
 Whatever latitude an absolute monarch may assume in his own conduct, whatever indulgence he may claim for his own passions, it is undoubtedly his interest that all his subjects should respect the natural and civil obligations of society.
 But the operation of the wisest laws is imperfect and precarious.
 They seldom inspire virtue, they cannot always restrain vice.
 Their power is insufficient to prohibit all that they condemn, nor can they always punish the actions which they prohibit.
 The legislators of antiquity had summoned to their aid the powers of education and of opinion.
 But every principle which had once maintained the vigour and purity of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Sparta</GPE> was long since extinguished in a declining and despotic empire.
 Philosophy still exercised her temperate sway over the human mind, but the cause of virtue derived very feeble support from the influence of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition.
 Under these discouraging circumstances a prudent magistrate might observe with pleasure the progress of a religion which diffused among the people a pure, benevolent, and universal system of ethics, adapted to every duty and every condition of life, recommended as the will and reason of the supreme Deity, and enforced by the sanction of eternal rewards or punishments.
 The experience of <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Roman</NORP> history could not inform the world how far the system of national manners might be reformed and improved by the precepts of a divine revelation; and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> might listen with some confidence to the flattering, and indeed reasonable, assurances of Lactantius.
 The eloquent apologist seemed firmly to expect, and almost ventured to promise, that the establishment of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> would restore the innocence and felicity of the primitive age; that the worship of the true God would extinguish war and dissension among those who mutually considered themselves as the children of a common parent; that every impure desire, every angry or selfish passion, would be restrained by the knowledge of the Gospel; and that the magistrates might sheath the sword of justice among a people who would be universally actuated by the sentiments of truth and piety, of equity and moderation, of harmony and universal love.
(17) Theory and practice of passive obedience.
.
 The passive and unresisting obedience which bows under the yoke of authority, or even of oppression, must have appeared in the eyes of an absolute monarch the most conspicuous and useful of the evangelic virtues.
(18) The primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> derived the institution of civil government, not from the consent of the people, but from the decrees of Heaven.
 The reigning emperor, though he had usurped the sceptre by treason and murder, immediately assumed the sacred character of vicegerent of the Deity.
 To the <PERSON>Deity</PERSON> alone he was accountable for the abuse of his power; and his subjects were indissolubly bound by their oath of fidelity to a tyrant who had violated every law of nature and society.
 The humble <NORP>Christians</NORP> were sent into the world as sheep among wolves; and since they were not permitted to employ force even in the defence of their religion, they should be still more criminal if they were tempted to shed the blood of their fellow-creatures in disputing the vain privileges or the sordid possessions of this transitory life.
 Faithful to the doctrine of the apostle, who in the reign of <PERSON>Nero</PERSON> had preached the duty of unconditional submission, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> centuries preserved their conscience pure and innocent of the guilt of secret conspiracy or open rebellion.
 While they experienced the rigour of persecution, they were never provoked either to meet their tyrants in the field, or indignantly to withdraw themselves into some remote and sequestered corner of the globe.
(19) The protestants of France, of Germany, and of Britain, who asserted with such intrepid courage their civil and religious freedom, have been insulted by the invidious comparison between the conduct of the primitive and of the reformed Christians.
(20) Perhaps, instead of censure, some applause may be due to the superior sense and spirit of our ancestors, who had convinced themselves that religion cannot abolish the unalienable rights of human nature.
(21) Perhaps the patience of the primitive church may be ascribed to its weakness as well as to its virtue.
 A sect of unwarlike plebeians, without leaders, without arms, without fortifications, must have encountered inevitable destruction in a rash and fruitless resistance to the master of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions.
 But the Christians, when they deprecated the wrath of Diocletian, or solicited the favour of Constantine, could allege, with truth and confidence, that they held the principle of passive obedience, and that, in the space of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> centuries, their conduct had always been conformable to their principles.
 They might add that the throne of the emperors would be established on a fixed and permanent basis if all their subjects, embracing the <NORP>Christian</NORP> doctrine, should learn to suffer and to obey.
 Divine right of Constantine.
 In the general order of <GPE>Providence</GPE> princes and tyrants are considered as the ministers of Heaven, appointed to rule or to chastise the nations of the earth.
 But sacred history affords many illustrious examples of the more immediate interposition of the <PERSON>Deity</PERSON> in the government of his chosen people.
 The sceptre and the sword were committed to the hands of Moses, of Joshua, of Gideon, of David, of the Maccabees; the virtues of those heroes were the motive or the effect of the divine favour, the success of their arms was destined to achieve the deliverance or the triumph of the church.
 If the judges of <GPE>Israel</GPE> were occasional and temporary magistrates, the kings of <GPE>Judah</GPE> derived from the royal unction of their great ancestor an hereditary and indefeasible right, which could not be forfeited by their own vices, nor recalled by the caprice of their subjects.
 The same extraordinary providence, which was no longer confined to the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> people, might elect <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and his family as the protectors of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world; and the devout <PERSON>Lactantius</PERSON> announces, in a prophetic tone, the future glories of his long and universal reign.
(22) <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> and Maximin, <GPE>Maxentius</GPE> and Licinius, were the rivals who shared with the favourite of Heaven the provinces of the empire.
 The tragic deaths of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> soon gratified the resentment, and fulfilled the sanguine expectations, of the Christians.
 The success of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> against <GPE>Maxentius</GPE> and <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> removed the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> formidable competitors who still opposed the triumph of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> David, and his cause might seem to claim the peculiar interposition of Providence.
 The character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tyrant disgraced the purple and human nature; and though the <NORP>Christians</NORP> might enjoy his precarious favour, they were exposed, with the rest of his subjects, to the effects of his wanton and capricious cruelty.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> soon betrayed the reluctance with which he had consented to the wise and humane regulations of the edict of Milan.
 The convocation of provincial synods was prohibited in his dominions; his <NORP>Christian</NORP> officers were ignominiously dismissed; and if he avoided the guilt, or rather danger, of a general persecution, his partial oppressions were rendered still more odious by the violation of a solemn and voluntary engagement.
 (23) While the East, according to the lively expression of Eusebius, was involved in the shades of infernal darkness.
 the auspicious rays of celestial light warmed and illuminated the provinces of the West.
 The piety of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was admitted as an unexceptionable proof of the justice of his arms; and his use of victory confirmed the opinion of the Christians, that their hero was inspired and conducted by the Lord of Hosts.
 The conquest of <GPE>Italy</GPE> produced a General Edict, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>324</CARDINAL> general edict of toleration; and as soon as the defeat of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> had invested <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> with the sole dominion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, he immediately, by circular letters, exhorted all his subjects to imitate, without delay, the example of their sovereign, and to embrace the divine truth of Christianity.
 (24) Loyalty and zeal of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> party.
 The assurance that the elevation of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was intimately connected with the designs of <GPE>Providence</GPE> instilled into the minds of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> opinions, which, by very different means, assisted the accomplishment of the prophecy.
 Their warm and active loyalty exhausted in his favour every resource of human industry; and they confidently expected that their strenuous efforts would be seconded by some divine and miraculous aid.
 The enemies of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> have imputed to interested motives the alliance which he insensibly contracted with the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church, and which apparently contributed to the success of his ambition.
 In the beginning of the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> century the <NORP>Christians</NORP> still bore a very inadequate proportion to the inhabitants of the empire; but among a degenerate people, who viewed the change of masters with the indifference of slaves, the spirit and union of a religious party might assist the popular leader, to whose service, from a principle of conscience, they had devoted their lives and fortunes.
 (25) The example of his father instructed <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to esteem and to reward the merit of the Christians; and in the distribution of public offices he had the advantage of strengthening his government by the choice of ministers or generals in whose fidelity he could repose a just and unreserved confidence.
 By the influence of these dignified missionaries the proselytes of the new faith must have multiplied in the court and army; the barbarians of Germany, who filled the ranks of the legions, were of a careless temper, which acquiesced without resistance in the religion of their commander; and when they passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> it may fairly be presumed that a great number of the soldiers had already consecrated their swords to the service of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and of Constantine.
(26) The habits of mankind and the interest of religion gradually abated the horror of war and bloodshed which had so long prevailed among the Christians; and in the councils which were assembled under the gracious protection of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the authority of the bishops was seasonably employed to ratify the obligation of the military oath, and to inflict the penalty of excommunication on those soldiers who threw away their arms during the peace of the church.
 (27) While <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> in his own dominions increased the number and zeal of his faithful adherents, he could depend on the support of a powerful faction in those provinces which were still possessed or usurped by his rivals.
 A secret disaffection was diffused among the <NORP>Christian</NORP> subjects of <GPE>Maxentius</GPE> and Licinius; and the resentment which the latter did not attempt to conceal served only to engage them still more deeply in the interest of his competitor.
 The regular correspondence which connected the bishops of the most distant provinces enabled them freely to communicate their wishes and their designs, and to transmit without danger any useful intelligence, or any pious contributions, which might promote the service of Constantine, who publicly declared that he had taken up arms for the deliverance of the church.
 (28) Expectation and belief of a miracle.
 The enthusiasm which inspired the troops, and perhaps the emperor himself, had sharpened their swords while it satisfied their conscience.
 They marched to battle with the full assurance that the same God who had formerly opened a passage to the <NORP>Israelites</NORP> through the waters of Jordan, and had thrown down the walls of <GPE>Jericho</GPE> at the sound of the trumpets of Joshua, would display his visible majesty and power in the victory of Constantine.
 The evidence of ecclesiastical history is prepared to affirm that their expectations were justified by the conspicuous miracle to which the conversion of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperor has been almost unanimously ascribed.
 The real or imaginary cause of so important an event deserves and demands the attention of posterity; and I shall endeavour to form a just estimate of the famous vision of Constantine, by a distinct consideration of the standard, the dream, and the celestial sign; by separating the historical, the natural, and the marvellous parts of this extraordinary story, which, in the composition of a specious argument, have been artfully confounded in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> splendid and brittle mass.
 The Labarum, or standard of the cross.
.
 I.
 An instrument of the tortures which were inflicted only on slaves and strangers became an object of horror in the eyes of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizen; and the ideas of guilt, of pain, and of ignominy, were closely united with the idea of the cross.
 (29) The piety, rather than the humanity, of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon abolished in his dominions the punishment which the Saviour of mankind had condescended to suffer;(30) but the emperor had already learned to despise the prejudices of his education and of his people, before he could erect in the midst of <GPE>Rome</GPE> his own statue, bearing a cross in its right hand, with an inscription which referred the victory of his arms, and the deliverance of Rome, to the virtue of that salutary sign, the true symbol of force and courage.
(31) The same symbol sanctified the arms of the soldiers of Constantine, the cross glittered on their helmet, was engraved on their shields, was interwoven into their banners; and the consecrated emblems which adorned the person of the emperor himself were distinguished only by richer materials and more exquisite workmanship.
(32) But the principal standard which displayed the triumph of the cross was styled the Labarum,(33) an obscure, though celebrated, name, which has been vainly derived from almost all the languages of the world.
 It is described(34) as a long pike intersected by a transversal beam.
 The silken veil which hung down from the beam was curiously inwrought with the images of the reigning monarch and his children.
 The summit of the pike supported a crown of gold, which enclosed the mysterious monogram, at once expressive of the figure of the cross and the initial letters of the name of Christ.
(35) The safety of the labarum was intrusted to <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> guards of approved valour and fidelity their station was marked by honours and emoluments; and some fortunate accidents soon introduced an opinion that as long as the guards of the labarum were engaged in the execution of their office they were secure and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy.
 In the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> civil war <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> felt and dreaded the power of this consecrated banner the sight of which in the distress of battle animated the soldiers of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> with an invincible enthusiasm, and scattered terror and dismay through the ranks of the adverse legions.
(36) The <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperors, who respected the example of Constantine, displayed in all their military expeditions the standard of the cross; but when the degenerate successors of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> had ceased to appear in person at the head of their armies, the labarum was deposited as a venerable but useless relic in the palace of Constantinople.
 (37) Its honours are still preserved on the medals of the <NORP>Flavian</NORP> family.
 Their grateful devotion has placed the monogram of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> in the midst of the ensigns of Rome.
 The solemn epithets of safety of the republic, glory of the army, restoration of public happiness, are equally applied to the religious and military trophies; and there is still extant a medal of the emperor Constantius, where the standard of the labarum is accompanied with these memorable words, BY THIS SIGN THOU SHALT CONQUER.
(38) The dream of Constantine.
 II.
 In all occasions of danger or distress it was the practice of the primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> to fortify their minds and bodies by the sign of the cross, which they used in all their ecclesiastical rites, in all the daily occurrences of life, as an infallible preservative against every species of spiritual or temporal evil.
 (39) The authority of the church might alone have had sufficient weight to justify the devotion of Constantine, who, in the same prudent and gradual progress, acknowledged the truth and assumed the symbol of Christianity.
 But the testimony of a contemporary writer, who in a formal treatise has avenged the cause of religion, bestows on the piety of the emperor a more awful and sublime character.
 He affirms, with the most perfect confidence, that, in the night which preceded the last battle against Maxentius, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was admonished in a dream to inscribe the shields of his soldiers with the celestial sign of God, the sacred monogram of the name of Christ; that he executed the commands of Heaven, and that his valour and obedience were rewarded by the decisive victory of the Milvian Bridge.
 Some considerations might perhaps incline a sceptical mind to suspect the judgment or the veracity of the rhetorician, whose pen, either from zeal or interest, was devoted to the cause of the prevailing faction.
(40) He appears to have published his "Deaths of the Persecutors" at <PERSON>Nicomedia</PERSON> about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years after the <NORP>Roman</NORP> victory; but the interval of a thousand miles, and a thousand days, will allow an ample latitude for the invention of declaimers, the credulity of party, and the tacit approbation of the emperor himself; who might listen without indignation to a marvellous tale which exalted his fame and promoted his designs.
 In favour of Licinius, who still dissembled his animosity to the Christians, the same author has provided a similar vision, of a form of prayer, which was communicated by an angel, and repeated by the whole army before they engaged the legions of the tyrant Maximin.
(41) The frequent repetition of miracles serves to provoke, where it does not subdue, the reason of mankind; but if the dream of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> is separately considered, it may be naturally explained either by the policy or the enthusiasm of the emperor.
 Whilst his anxiety for the approaching day, which must decide the fate of the empire, was suspended by a short and interrupted slumber, the venerable form of Christ, and the well-known symbol of his religion, might forcibly offer themselves to the active fancy of a prince who reverenced the name, and had perhaps secretly implored the power, of the God of the Christians.
 As readily might a consummate statesman indulge himself in the use of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of those military stratagems, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of those pious frauds, which <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sertorius</PERSON> had employed with such art and effect.
(42) The preternatural origin of dreams was universally admitted by the nations of antiquity, and a considerable part of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> army was already prepared to place their confidence in the salutary sign of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion.
 The secret vision of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> could be disproved only by the event; and the intrepid hero who had passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and the <PERSON>Apennine</PERSON> might view with careless despair the consequences of a defeat under the walls of Rome.
 The senate and people, exulting in their own deliverance from an odious tyrant, acknowledged that the victory of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> surpassed the powers of man, without daring to insinuate that it had been obtained by the protection of the gods.
 The triumphal arch, which was erected about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years after the event, proclaims, in ambiguous language, that, by the greatness of his own mind, and by an instinct or impulse of the Divinity, he had saved and avenged the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic.
(43) The <NORP>Pagan</NORP> orator, who had seized an earlier opportunity of celebrating the virtues of the conqueror, supposes that he alone enjoyed a secret and intimate commerce with the Supreme Being, who delegated the care of mortals to his subordinate deities; and thus assigns a very plausible reason why the subjects of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> should not presume to embrace the new religion of their sovereign.
(44) Appearance of a cross in the sky.
.
 III.
 The philosopher, who with calm suspicion examines the dreams and omens, the miracles and prodigies, of profane or even of ecclesiastical history, will probably conclude that, if the eyes of the spectators have sometimes been deceived by fraud, the understanding of the readers has much more frequently been insulted by fiction.
 Every event, or appearance, or accident, which seems to deviate from the ordinary course of nature, has been rashly ascribed to the immediate action of the Deity; and the astonished fancy of the multitude has sometimes given shape and colour, language and motion, to the fleeting but uncommon meteors of the air.
 (45) <PERSON>Nazarius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> are the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most celebrated orators who, in studied panegyrics, have laboured to exalt the glory of Constantine.
 Nine years after the <NORP>Roman</NORP> victory A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>321</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Nazarius</PERSON> (46) describes an army of divine warriors, who seemed to fall from the sky; he marks their beauty, their spirit, their gigantic forms, the stream of light which beamed from their celestial armour, their patience in suffering themselves to be heard, as well as seen, by mortals; and their declaration that they were sent, that they flew, to the assistance of the great Constantine.
 For the truth of this prodigy the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> orator appeals to the whole <NORP>Gallic</NORP> nation, in whose presence he was then speaking; and seems to hope that the ancient apparitions(47) would now obtain credit from this recent and public event.
 The <NORP>Christian</NORP> fable of Eusebius, which, in the space of twenty-six years, might arise A.
D.
 338 from the original dream, is cast in a much more correct and elegant mould.
 In <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the marches of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> he is reported to have seen with his own eyes the luminous trophy of the cross, placed above the meridian sun, and inscribed with the following words: BY THIS CONQUER.
 This amazing object in the sky astonished the whole army, as well as the emperor himself who was yet undetermined in the choice of a religion: but his astonishment was converted into faith by the vision of the ensuing night.
 <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> appeared before his eyes; and displaying the same celestial sign of the cross, he directed <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to frame a similar standard, and to march, with an assurance of victory, against <GPE>Maxentius</GPE> and all his enemies.
 (48) The learned bishop of <GPE>Caesarea</GPE> appears to be sensible that the recent discovery of this marvellous anecdote would excite some surprise and distrust among the most pious of his readers.
 Yet, instead of ascertaining the precise circumstances of time and place, which always serve to detect falsehood or establish truth; (49) instead of collecting and recording the evidence of so many living witnesses, who must have been spectators of this stupendous miracle,(50) <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> contents himself with alleging a very singular testimony, that of the deceased Constantine, who, many years after the event, in the freedom of conversation, had related to him this extraordinary incident of his own life, and had attested the truth of it by a solemn oath.
 The prudence and gratitude of the learned prelate forbade him to suspect the veracity of his victorious master; but he plainly intimates that, in a fact of such a nature, he should have refused his assent to any meaner authority.
 This motive of credibility could not survive the power of the <NORP>Flavian</NORP> family, and the celestial sign, which the <NORP>Infidels</NORP> might afterwards deride, (51) was disregarded by the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of the age which immediately followed the conversion of Constantine.
 (52) But the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church, both of the <LOC>East</LOC> and of the West, has adopted a prodigy which favours, or seems to favour, the popular worship of the cross.
 The vision of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> maintained an honourable place in the legend of superstition till the bold and sagacious spirit of criticism presumed to depreciate the triumph, and to arraign the truth, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperor.
(53) The conversion of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> might be sincere.
 The <NORP>Protestant</NORP> and philosophic readers of the present age will incline to believe that, in the account of his own conversion, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> attested a wilful falsehood by a solemn and deliberate perjury.
 They may not hesitate to pronounce that, in the choice of a religion, his mind was determined only by a sense of interest; and that ( according to the expression of a profane poet(54) ) he used the altars of the church as a convenient footstool to the throne of the empire.
 A conclusion so harsh and so absolute is not, however, warranted by our knowledge of human nature, of Constantine, or of Christianity.
 In an age of religious fervour the most artful statesmen are observed to feel some part of the enthusiasm which they inspire; and the most orthodox saints assume the dangerous privilege of defending the cause of truth by the arms of deceit and falsehood.
 Personal interest is often the standard of our belief, as well as of our practice and the same motives of temporal advantage which might influence the public conduct and professions of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> would insensibly dispose his mind to embrace a religion so propitious to his fame and fortunes.
 His vanity was gratified by the flattering assurance that he had been chosen by Heaven to reign over the earth: success had justified his divine title to the throne, and that title was founded on the truth of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> revelation.
 As real virtue is sometimes excited by undeserved applause, the specious piety of Constantine, if at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> it was only specious, might gradually, by the influence of praise, of habit, and of example, be matured into serious faith and fervent devotion.
 The bishops and teachers of the new sect, whose dress and manners had not qualified them for the residence of a court, were admitted to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> table; they accompanied the monarch in his expeditions; and the ascendant which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of them, an <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> or a Spaniard, (55) acquired over his mind was imputed by the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> to the effect of magic.
(56) Lactantius, who has adorned the precepts of the <ORG>Gospel</ORG> with the eloquence of Cicero, (57) and Eusebius, who has consecrated the learning and philosophy of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> to the service of religion,(58) were both received into the friendship and familiarity of their sovereign; and those able masters of controversy could patiently watch the soft and yielding moments of persuasion, and dexterously apply the arguments which were the best adapted to his character and understanding.
 Whatever advantages might be derived from the acquisition of an <ORG>Imperial</ORG> proselyte, he was distinguished by the splendour of his purple, rather than by the superiority of wisdom or virtue, from the many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of his subjects who had embraced the doctrines of Christianity.
 Nor can it be deemed incredible that the mind of an unlettered soldier should have yielded to the weight of evidence which, in a more enlightened age, has satisfied or subdued the reason of a Grotius, a Pascal, or a Locke.
 In the midst of the incessant labours of his great office this soldier employed or affected to employ, the hours of the night in the diligent study of the Scriptures, and the composition of theological discourses, which he afterwards pronounced in the presence of a numerous and applauding audience.
 In a very long discourse, which is still extant, the royal preacher expatiates on the various proofs of religion; but he dwells with peculiar complacency on the <NORP>Sibylline</NORP> verses,(59) and the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> eclogue of Virgil.
 (60) Forty years before the birth of Christ, the <NORP>Mantuan</NORP> bard, as if inspired by the celestial muse of Isaiah, had celebrated, with all the pomp of oriental metaphor, the return of the Virgin, the fall of the serpent, the approaching birth of a godlike child, the offspring of the great Jupiter, who should expiate the guilt of human kind and govern the peaceful universe with the virtues of his father; the rise and appearance of an heavenly race, a primitive nation throughout the world; and the gradual restoration of the innocence and felicity of the golden age.
 The poet was perhaps unconscious of the secret sense and object of these sublime predictions, which have been so unworthily applied to the infant son of a consul, or a triumvir:(61) but if a more splendid, and indeed specious, interpretation of the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> eclogue contributed to the conversion of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperor, <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> may deserve to be ranked among the most successful missionaries of the Gospel.
(62) Devotion and privileges of Constantine.
 The awful mysteries of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith and worship were concealed from the eyes of strangers, and even of catechumens, with an affected secrecy, which served to excite their wonder and curiosity.
(63) But the severe rules of discipline which the prudence of the bishops had instituted were relaxed by the same prudence in favour of an <ORG>Imperial</ORG> proselyte, whom it was so important to allure, by every gentle condescension, into the pale of the church; and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was permitted, at least by a tacit dispensation, to enjoy most of the privileges, before he had contracted any of the obligations, of a Christian.
 Instead of retiring from the congregation when the voice of the deacon dismissed the profane multitude, he prayed with the faithful, disputed with the bishops, preached on the most sublime and intricate subjects of theology, celebrated with sacred rites the vigil of Easter, and publicly declared himself, not only a partaker, but, in some measure, a priest and hierophant of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> mysteries.
 (64) The pride of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> might assume, and his services had deserved, some extraordinary distinction; an ill-timed rigour might have blasted the unripened fruits of his conversion; and if the doors of the church had been strictly closed against a prince who had deserted the altars of the gods, the master of the empire would have been left destitute of any form of religious worship.
 In his last visit to <GPE>Rome</GPE> he piously disclaimed and insulted the superstition of his ancestors, by refusing to lead the military procession of the equestrian order, and to offer the public vows to the <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> of the Capitoline Hill.
 (65) Many years before his baptism and death <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had proclaimed to the world that neither his person nor his image should evermore be seen within the walls of an idolatrous temple; while he distributed through the provinces a variety of medals and pictures which represented the emperor in an humble and suppliant posture of <NORP>Christian</NORP> devotion.
(66) Delay of his baptism till the approach of death.
 The pride of Constantine, who refused the privileges of a catechumen, cannot easily be explained or excused; but the delay of his baptism may be justified by the maxims and the practice of ecclesiastical antiquity.
 The sacrament of baptism(67) was regularly administered by the bishop himself, with his assistant clergy, in the cathedral church of the diocese, during the <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> days between the solemn festivals of <DATE>Easter</DATE> and Pentecost; and this holy term admitted a numerous band of infants and adult persons into the bosom of the church.
 The discretion of parents often suspended the baptism of their children till they could understand the obligations which they contracted: the severity of ancient bishops exacted from the new converts a novitiate of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years; and the catechumens themselves, from different motives of a temporal or a spiritual nature, were seldom impatient to assume the character of perfect and initiated Christians.
 The sacrament of baptism was supposed to contain a full and absolute expiation of sin; and the soul, was instantly restored to its original purity, and entitled to the promise of eternal salvation.
 Among the proselytes of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> there were many who judged it imprudent to precipitate a salutary rite which could not be repeated; to throw away an inestimable privilege which could never be recovered.
 By the delay of their baptism they could venture freely to indulge their passions in the enjoyment of this world, while they still retained in their own hands the means of a sure and easy absolution.
(68) The sublime theory of the <ORG>Gospel</ORG> had made a much fainter impression on the heart than on the understanding of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> himself.
 He pursued the great object of his ambition through the dark and bloody paths of war and policy; and, after the victory, he abandoned himself, without moderation, to the abuse of his fortune.
 Instead of asserting his just superiority above the imperfect heroism and profane philosophy of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> and the Antonines, the mature age of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> forfeited the reputation which he had acquired in his youth.
 As he gradually advanced in the knowledge of truth, he proportionably declined in the practice of virtue; and the same year of his reign in which he convened the council of <GPE>Nice</GPE> was polluted by the execution, or rather murder, of his eldest son.
 This date is alone sufficient to refute the ignorant and malicious suggestions of Zosimus(69) who affirms that, after the death of Crispus, the remorse of his father accepted from the ministers of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> the expiation which he had vainly solicited from the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> pontiffs.
 At the time of the death of <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> the emperor could no longer hesitate in the choice of a religion; he could no longer be ignorant that the church was possessed of an infallible remedy, though he chose to defer the application of it till the approach of death had removed the temptation and danger of a relapse.
 The bishops whom he summoned in his last illness to the palace of <PERSON>Nicomedia</PERSON> were edified by the fervour with which he requested and received the sacrament of baptism, by the solemn protestation that the remainder of his life should be worthy of a disciple of Christ, and by his humble refusal to wear the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> purple after he had been clothed in the white garment of a Neophyte.
 The example and reputation of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> seemed to countenance the delay of baptism.
 (70) Future tyrants were encouraged to believe that the innocent blood which they might shed in a long reign would instantly be washed away in the waters of regeneration; and the abuse of religion dangerously undermined the foundations of moral virtue.
 Propagation of Christianity.
 The gratitude of the church has exalted the virtues and excused the failings of a generous patron, who seated <NORP>Christianity</NORP> on the throne of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; and the Greeks, who celebrate the festival of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> saint, seldom mention the name of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> without adding the title of equal to the <PERSON>Apostles</PERSON> .
(71) Such a comparison, if it alludes to the character of those divine missionaries, must be imputed to the extravagance of impious flattery.
 But if the parallel is confined to the extent and number of their evangelic victories, the success of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> might perhaps equal that of the <PERSON>Apostles</PERSON> themselves.
 By the edicts of toleration he removed the temporal disadvantages which had hitherto retarded the progress of Christianity; and its active and numerous ministers received a free permission, a liberal encouragement, to recommend the salutary truths of revelation by every argument which could affect the reason or piety of mankind.
 The exact balance of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> religions continued but a moment; and the piercing eye of ambition and avarice soon discovered that the profession of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> might contribute to the interest of the present, as well as of a future life.
 (72) The hopes of wealth and honours, the example of an emperor, his exhortations, his irresistible smiles, diffused conviction among the venal and obsequious crowds which usually fill the apartments of a palace.
 The cities which signalised a forward zeal by the voluntary destruction of their temples were distinguished by municipal privileges and rewarded with popular donatives; and the new capital of the <LOC>East</LOC> gloried in the singular advantage that <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was never profaned by the worship of idols.
 (73) As the lower ranks of society are governed by imitation, the conversion of those who possessed any eminence of birth, of power, or of riches, was soon followed by dependent multitudes.
 (74) The salvation of the common people was purchased at an easy rate, if it be true that, in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> year, twelve thousand men were baptised at Rome, besides a proportionable number of women and children, and that a white garment, with <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, had been promised by the emperor to every convert.
(75) The powerful influence of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was not circumscribed by the narrow limits of his life or of his dominions.
 The education which he bestowed on his sons and nephews secured to the empire a race of princes whose faith was still more lively and sincere, as they imbibed, in their earliest infancy, the spirit, or at least the doctrine, of Christianity.
 War and commerce had spread the knowledge of the <ORG>Gospel</ORG> beyond the confines of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces; and the barbarians, who had disdained an humble and proscribed sect, soon learned to esteem a religion which had been so lately embraced by the greatest monarch and the most civilised nation of the globe.
 (76) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Germans, who enlisted under the standard of Rome, revered the cross which glittered at the head of the legions, and their fierce countrymen received at the same time the lessons of faith and of humanity.
 The kings of <LOC>Iberia</LOC> and <GPE>Armenia</GPE> worshipped the God of their protector; and their subjects, who have invariably preserved the name of Christians, soon formed a sacred and perpetual connection with their <NORP>Roman</NORP> brethren.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> of <GPE>Persia</GPE> were suspected, in time of war, of preferring their religion to their country; but as long as peace subsisted between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, the persecuting spirit of the <PERSON>Magi</PERSON> was effectually restrained by the interposition of Constantine.
 (77) The rays of the <ORG>Gospel</ORG> illuminated the coast of India.
 The colonies of <NORP>Jews</NORP> who had penetrated into <GPE>Arabia</GPE> and Ethiopia(78) opposed the progress of Christianity; but the labour of the missionaries was in some measure facilitated by a previous knowledge of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> revelation; and <PERSON>Abyssinia</PERSON> still reveres the memory of Frumentius, who, in the time of Constantine, devoted his life to the conversion of those sequestered regions.
 Under the reign of his son Constantius, Theophilus, (79) who was himself of <NORP>Indian</NORP> extraction, was invested with the double character of ambassador and bishop.
 He embarked on the Red Sea with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horses of the purest breed of Cappadocia, which were sent by the emperor of the prince of the Sabaeans, or Homerites.
 <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> was intrusted with many other useful or curious presents, which might raise the admiration and conciliate the friendship of the barbarians; and he successfully employed several years in a pastoral visit to the churches of the torrid zone.
(80) Change of the national religion.
.
 The irresistible power of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors was displayed in the important and dangerous change of the national religion.
 The terrors of a military force silenced the faint and unsupported murmurs of the Pagans, and there was reason to expect that the cheerful submission of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> clergy, as well as the people, would be the result of conscience and gratitude.
 It was long since established as a fundamental maxim of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution, that every rank of citizens was alike subject to the laws, and that the care of religion was the right as well as duty of the civil magistrate.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and his successors could not easily persuade themselves that they had forfeited, by their conversion, any branch of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> prerogatives, or that they were incapable of giving laws to a religion which they had protected and embraced.
 The emperors still continued to exercise a supreme jurisdiction over the A.
D.
 312-438ecclesiastical order; and the <ORDINAL>sixteenth</ORDINAL> book of the <WORK_OF_ART>Theodosian</WORK_OF_ART> code represents, under a variety of titles, the authority which they assumed in the government of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 Distinction of the spiritual and temporal powers.
 But the distinction of the spiritual and temporal powers,(81) which had never been imposed on the free spirit of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Rome, was introduced and confirmed by the legal establishment of Christianity.
 The office of supreme pontiff, which, from the time of <GPE>Numa</GPE> to that of Augustus, had always been exercised by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most eminent of the senators, was at length united to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> dignity.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate of the state, as often as he was prompted by superstition or policy, performed with his own hands the sacerdotal functions;(82) nor was there any order of priests, either at <GPE>Rome</GPE> or in the provinces, who claimed a more sacred character among men, or a more intimate communication with the gods.
 But in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> church, which intrusts the service of the altar to a perpetual succession of consecrated ministers, the monarch, whose spiritual rank is less honourable than that of the meanest deacon, was seated below the rails of the sanctuary, and confounded with the rest of the faithful multitude.
 (83) The emperor might be saluted as the father of his people, but he owed a filial duty and reverence to the fathers of the church; and the same marks of respect which <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had paid to the persons of saints and confessors were soon exacted by the pride of the episcopal order.
(84) A secret conflict between the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdictions embarrassed the operations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; and a pious emperor was alarmed by the guilt and danger of touching with a profane hand the ark of the covenant.
 The separation of men into the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> orders of the clergy and of the laity was, indeed, familiar to many nations of antiquity; and the priests of India, of Persia, of Assyria, of Judea, of Ethiopia, of Egypt, and of Gaul, derived from a celestial origin the temporal power and possessions which they had acquired.
 These venerable institutions had gradually assimilated themselves to the manners and government of their respective countries;(85) but the opposition or contempt of the civil power served to cement the discipline of the primitive church.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> had been obliged to elect their own magistrates, to raise and distribute a peculiar revenue, and to regulate the internal policy of their republic by a code of laws, which were ratified by the consent of the people and the practice of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years.
 When <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> embraced the faith of the Christians, he seemed to contract a perpetual alliance with a distinct and independent society; and the privileges granted or confirmed by that emperor, or by his successors, were accepted, not as the precarious favours of the court, but as the just and inalienable rights of the ecclesiastical order.
 State of the bishops under the <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperors.
.
 The <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church was administered by the spiritual and legal jurisdiction of eighteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> bishops(86) of whom <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand were seated in the Greek, and eight <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> in the Latin, provinces of the empire.
 The extent and boundaries of their respective dioceses had been variously and accidentally decided by the zeal and success of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> missionaries, by the wishes of the people, and by the propagation of the Gospel.
 <NORP>Episcopal</NORP> churches were closely planted along the banks of the Nile, on the seacoast of Africa, in the proconsular Asia, and through the southern provinces of Italy.
 The bishops of <GPE>Gaul</GPE> and Spain, of <GPE>Thrace</GPE> and Pontus, reigned over an ample territory, and delegated their rural suffragans to execute the subordinate duties of the pastoral office.
 (87) A <NORP>Christian</NORP> diocese might be spread over a province, or reduced to a village; but all the bishops possessed an equal and indelible character; they all derived the same powers and privileges from the apostles, from the people, and from the laws.
 While the civil and military professions were separated by the policy of Constantine, a new and perpetual order of ecclesiastical ministers, always respectable, sometimes dangerous, was established in the church and state.
 The important review of their station and attributes may be distributed under the following heads:Election of bishops.
 I.
 The freedom of elections subsisted long after the legal establishment of Christianity, (88) and the subjects of <GPE>Rome</GPE> enjoyed in the church the privilege which they had lost in the republic, of choosing the magistrates whom they were bound to obey.
 As soon as a bishop had closed his eyes, the metropolitan issued a commission to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his suffragans to administer the vacant see, and prepare, within a limited time, the future election.
 The right of voting was vested in the inferior clergy, who were best qualified to judge of the merit of the candidates; in the senators or nobles of the city, all those who were distinguished by their rank or property; and finally in the whole body of the people, who on the appointed day flocked in multitudes from the most remote parts of the diocese,(89) and sometimes silenced, by their tumultuous acclamations, the voice of reason and the laws of discipline.
 These acclamations might accidentally fix on the head of the most deserving competitor, of some ancient presbyter, some holy monk, or some layman conspicuous for his zeal and piety.
 But the episcopal chair was solicited, especially in the great and opulent cities of the empire, as a temporal rather than as a spiritual dignity.
 The interested views, the selfish and angry passions, the arts of perfidy and dissimulation, the secret corruption, the open and even bloody violence which had formerly disgraced the freedom of election in the commonwealths of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Rome, too often influenced the choice of the successors of the apostles.
 While <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the candidates boasted the honours of his family, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> allured his judges by the delicacies of a plentiful table, and a third, more guilty than his rivals, offered to share the plunder of the church among the accomplices of his sacrilegious hopes.
(90) The civil as well as ecclesiastical laws attempted to exclude the populace from this solemn and important transaction.
 The canons of ancient discipline, by requiring several episcopal qualifications of age, station, etc.
, restrained in some measure the indiscriminate caprice of the electors.
 The authority of the provincial bishops, who were assembled in the vacant church to consecrate the choice of the people, was interposed to moderate their passions and to correct their mistakes.
 The bishops could refuse to ordain an unworthy candidate, and the rage of contending factions sometimes accepted their impartial mediation.
 The submission or the resistance of the clergy and people, on various occasions, afforded different precedents, which were insensibly converted into positive laws and provincial customs: (91) but it was everywhere admitted, as a fundamental maxim of religious policy, that no bishop could be imposed on an orthodox church without the consent of its members.
 The emperors, as the guardians of the public peace, and as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> citizens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Constantinople, might effectually declare their wishes in the choice of a primate; but those absolute monarchs respected the freedom of ecclesiastical elections, and, while they distributed and resumed the honours of the state and army, they allowed eighteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> perpetual magistrates to receive their important offices from the free suffrages of the people.
(92) It was agreeable to the dictates of justice that these magistrates should not desert an honourable station from which they could not be removed; but the wisdom of councils endeavoured, without much success, to enforce the residence, and to prevent the translation, of bishops.
 The discipline of the <LOC>West</LOC> was indeed less relaxed than that of the East; but the same passions which made those regulations necessary rendered them ineffectual.
 The reproaches which angry prelates have so vehemently urged against each other serve; only to expose their common guilt and their mutual indiscretion.
 Ordination of the clergy II.
 The bishops alone possessed the faculty of spiritual generation, and this extraordinary privilege might compensate, in some degree, for the painful celibacy(93) which was imposed as a virtue, as a duty, and at length as a positive obligation.
 The religions of antiquity, which established a separate order of priests, dedicated a holy race, a tribe or family, to the perpetual service of the gods.
 (94) Such institutions were founded for possession rather than conquest.
 The children of the priests enjoyed, with proud and indolent security, their sacred inheritance; and the fiery spirit of enthusiasm was abated by the cares, the pleasures, and the endearments of domestic life.
 But the <NORP>Christian</NORP> sanctuary was open to every ambitious candidate who aspired to its heavenly promises or temporal possessions.
 The office of priests, like that of soldiers or magistrates, was strenuously exercised by those men whose temper and abilities had prompted them to embrace the ecclesiastical profession, or who had been selected by a discerning bishop as the best qualified to promote the glory and interest of the church.
 The bishops(95) (till the abuse was restrained by the prudence of the laws) might constrain the reluctant and protect the distressed, and the imposition of hands for ever bestowed some of the most valuable privileges of civil society.
 The whole body of the catholic clergy, more numerous, perhaps, than the legions, was exempted by the emperors from all service, private or public, all municipal offices, and all personal taxes and contributions, which pressed on their fellow-citizens with intolerable weight; and the duties of their holy profession were accepted as a full discharge of their obligations to the republic.
(96) Each bishop acquired an absolute and indefeasible right to the perpetual obedience of the clerk whom he ordained; the clergy of each episcopal church, with its dependent parishes, formed a regular and permanent society; and the cathedrals of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> (97) and Carthage(98) maintained their peculiar establishment of five <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> ecclesiastical ministers.
 Their ranks(99) and numbers were insensibly multiplied by the superstition of the times, which introduced into the church the splendid ceremonies of a <NORP>Jewish</NORP> or <NORP>Pagan</NORP> temple; and a long train of priests, deacons, subdeacons, acolytes, exorcists, readers, singers, and doorkeepers contributed, in their respective stations, to swell the pomp and harmony of religious worship.
 The clerical name and privilege were extended to many pious fraternities, who devoutly supported the ecclesiastical throne.
 (100) Six <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> parabolani, or adventurers, visited the sick at Alexandria; eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> copiate, or grave-diggers buried the dead at Constantinople; and the swarms of monks, who arose from the Nile, overspread and darkened the face of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world.
 Property.
 III.
 The edict of <GPE>Milan</GPE> secured the revenue as well as the peace of the church.
 (101) The <NORP>Christians</NORP> not only recovered the lands and houses of which they had been stripped by the persecuting laws of Diocletian, but they acquired a perfect title to all the possessions which they had hitherto enjoyed by the connivance of the magistrate.
 As soon as <NORP>Christianity</NORP> became the religion of the emperor and the empire, the national clergy might claim a decent and honourable maintenance: and the payment of an annual tax might have delivered the people from the more oppressive tribute which superstition imposes on her votaries.
 But as the wants and expenses of the church increased with her prosperity, the ecclesiastical order was still supported and enriched by the voluntary oblations of the faithful.
 Eight years after the edict of Milan, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> granted to all his subjects the free and universal permission of bequeathing their fortunes to the holy <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church; (102) and their devout liberality, which during their lives was checked by luxury or avarice, flowed with a profuse stream at the hour of their death.
 The wealthy <NORP>Christians</NORP> were encouraged by the example of their sovereign.
 An absolute monarch, who is rich without patrimony, may be charitable without merit; and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> too easily believed that he should purchase the favour of Heaven if he maintained the idle at the expense of the industrious, and distributed among the saints the wealth of the republic.
 The same messenger who carried over to <LOC>Africa</LOC> the head of <GPE>Maxentius</GPE> might be intrusted with an epistle to Caecilian, bishop of Carthage.
 The emperor acquaints him that the treasurers of the province are directed to pay into his hands the sum of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand folles, or eighteen thousand pounds sterling, and to obey his farther requisitions for the relief of the churches of Africa, <GPE>Numidia</GPE> and Mauritania.
 (103) The liberality of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> increased in a just proportion to his faith and to his vices.
 He assigned in each city a regular allowance of corn to supply the fund of ecclesiastical charity, and the persons of both sexes who embraced the monastic life became the peculiar favourites of their sovereign.
 The <NORP>Christian</NORP> temples of Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Constantinople, etc.
, displayed the ostentatious piety of a prince ambitious in a declining age to equal the perfect labours of antiquity.
 (104) The form of these religious edifices was simple and oblong, though they might sometimes swell into the shape of a dome, and sometimes branch into the figure of a cross.
 The timbers were framed for the most part of cedars of Libanus; the roof was covered with tiles, perhaps of gilt brass; and the walls, the columns, the pavement, were incrusted with variegated marbles.
 The most precious ornaments of gold and silver, of silk and gems, were profusely dedicated to the service of the altar, and this specious magnificence was supported on the solid and perpetual basis of landed property.
 In the space of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> centuries, from the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to that of Justinian, the eighteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> churches of the empire were enriched by the frequent and unalienable gifts of the prince and people.
 An annual income of six <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds sterling may be reasonably assigned to the bishops, who were placed at an equal distance between riches and poverty,(105) but the standard of their wealth insensibly rose with the dignity and opulence of the cities which they governed.
 An authentic but imperfect(106) rent-roll specifies some houses, shops, gardens, and farms, which belonged to the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <GPE>Basilicue</GPE> of <GPE>Rome</GPE> — St.
 Peter, St.
 Paul, and St.
 John Lateran — in the provinces of Italy, Africa, and the East.
 They produce, besides a reserved rent of oil, linen, paper, aromatics, etc.
, a clear annual revenue of twenty-two thousand pieces of gold, or twelve thousand pounds sterling.
 In the age of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> the bishops no longer possessed, perhaps they no longer deserved, the unsuspecting confidence of their clergy and people.
 The ecclesiastical revenues of each diocese were divided into <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> parts, for the respective uses of the bishop himself, of his inferior clergy, of the poor, and of the public worship; and the abuse of this sacred trust was strictly and repeatedly checked.
(107) The patrimony of the church was still subject to all the public impositions of the state.
(108) The clergy of Rome, Alexandria, Thessalonica, etc.
, might solicit and obtain some partial exemptions; but the premature attempt of the great council of Rimini, which aspired to universal freedom, was successfully resisted by the son of Constantine.
(109) Civil Jurisdiction.

 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy, who erected their tribunal on the ruins of the civil and common law, have modestly accepted, as the gift of Constantine,(110) the independent jurisdiction which was the fruit of time, of accident, and of their own industry.
 But the liberality of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperors had actually endowed them with some legal prerogatives which secured and dignified the sacerdotal character.
(111) 1.
 Under a despotic government, the bishops alone enjoyed and asserted the inestimable privilege of being tried only by their peers; and even in a capital accusation, a synod of their brethren were the sole judges of their guilt or innocence.
 Such a tribunal, unless it was inflamed by personal resentment or religious discord, might be favourable, or even partial, to the sacerdotal order: but <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was satisfied (112) that secret impunity would be less pernicious than public scandal, and the <PERSON>Nicene</PERSON> council was edified by his public declaration, that, if he surprised a bishop in the act of adultery, he should cast his <ORG>Imperial</ORG> mantle over the episcopal sinner.
 2.
 The domestic jurisdiction of the bishops was at once a privilege and a restraint of the ecclesiastical order, whose civil causes were decently withdrawn from the cognisance of a secular judge.
 Their venial offences were not exposed to the shame of a public trial or punishment and the gentle correction which the tenderness of youth may endure from its parents or instructors was inflicted by the temperate severity of the bishops.
 But if the clergy were guilty of any crime which could not be sufficiently expiated by their degradation from an honourable and beneficial profession, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate drew the sword of justice, without any regard to ecclesiastical immunities.
 3.
 The arbitration of the bishops was ratified by a positive law and the judges were instructed to execute, without appeal or delay, the episcopal decrees, whose validity had hitherto depended on the consent of the parties.
 The conversion of the magistrates themselves, and of the whole empire, might gradually remove the fears and scruples of the Christians.
 But they still resorted to the tribunal of the bishops, whose abilities and integrity they esteemed; and the venerable <PERSON>Austin</PERSON> enjoyed the satisfaction of complaining that his spiritual functions were perpetually interrupted by the invidious labour of deciding the claim or the possession of silver and gold, of lands and cattle.
 4.
 The ancient privilege of sanctuary was transferred to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> temples, and extended, by the liberal piety of the younger Theodosius, to the precincts of consecrated ground.
(113) The fugitive, and even guilty, suppliants were permitted to implore either the justice or the mercy of the <PERSON>Deity</PERSON> and his ministers.
 The rash violence of despotism was suspended by the mild interposition of the church, and the lives or fortunes of the most eminent subjects might be protected by the mediation of the bishop.
 Spiritual censures.
 V.
 The bishop was the perpetual censor of the morals of his people.
 The discipline of penance was digested into a system of canonical jurisprudence,(114) which accurately defined the duty of private or public confession, the rules of evidence the degrees of guilt, and the measure of punishment.
 It was impossible to execute this spiritual censure, if the <NORP>Christian</NORP> pontiff who punished the obscure sins of the multitude, respected the conspicuous vices and destructive crimes of the magistrate: but it was impossible to arraign the conduct of the magistrate without controlling the administration of civil government.
 Some considerations of religion, or royalty, or fear, protected the sacred persons of the emperors from the zeal or resentment of the bishops; but they boldly censured and excommunicated the subordinate tyrants who were not invested with the majesty of the purple.
 St.
 Athanasius ex-communicated <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ministers of Egypt, and the interdict which he pronounced of fire and water was solemnly transmitted to the churches of Cappodocia.
(115) Under the reign of the younger Theodosius, the polite and eloquent Synesius, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the descendants of Hercules,(116) filled the episcopal seat of Ptolemais, near the ruins of ancient Cyrene,(117) and the philosophic bishop supported with dignity the character which he had assumed with reluctance.
(118) He vanquished the monster of Libya, the president Andronicus, who abused the authority of a venal office, invented new modes of rapine and torture, and aggravated the guilt of oppression by that of sacrilege.
(119) After a fruitless attempt to reclaim the haughty magistrate by mild and religious admonition, <PERSON>Synesius</PERSON> proceeds to inflict the last sentence of ecclesiastical justice,(120) which devotes Andronicus, with his associates and their families, to the abhorrence of earth and heaven.
 The impenitent sinners more cruel than <NORP>Phalaris</NORP> or Sennacherib, more destructive than war, pestilence, or a cloud of locusts, are deprived of the name and privileges of Christians, of the participation of the sacraments, and of the hope of Paradise.
 The bishop exhorts the clergy, the magistrates, and the people to renounce all society with the enemies of christ, to exclude them from their houses and tables, and to refuse them the common offices of life, and the decent rites of burial.
 The church of Ptolemais, obscure and contemptible as she may appear, addresses this declaration to all her sister churches of the world; and the profane who reject her decrees will be involved in he guilt and punishment of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> and his impious followers.
 These spiritual terrors were enforced by a dexterous application to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court; the trembling president implored the mercy of the church, and the descendant of <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> enjoyed the satisfaction of raising a prostrate tyrant from the ground.
 (121) Such principles and such examples insensibly prepared the triumph of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiffs, who have trampled on the necks of kings.
 Freedom of public preaching.
 VI.
 Every popular government has experienced the effects of rude or artificial eloquence.
 The coldest nature is animated, the firmest reason is moved, by the rapid communication of the prevailing impulse; and each hearer is affected by his own passions and by those of the surrounding multitude.
 The ruin of civil liberty had silenced the demagogues of <GPE>Athens</GPE> and the tribunes of Rome; the custom of preaching, which seems to constitute a considerable part of <NORP>Christian</NORP> devotion, had not been introduced into the temples of antiquity; and the ears of monarchs were never invaded by the harsh sound of popular eloquence till the pulpits of the empire were filled with sacred orators, who possessed some advantages unknown to their profane predecessors.
(122) The arguments and rhetoric of the tribune were instantly opposed, with equal arms, by skilful and resolute antagonists; and the cause of truth and reason might derive an accidental support from the conflict of hostile passions.
 The bishop, or some distinguished presbyter to whom he cautiously delegated the powers of preaching, harangued, without the danger of interruption or reply, a submissive multitude, whose minds had been prepared and subdued by the awful ceremonies of religion.
 Such was the strict subordination of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church that the same concerted sounds might issue at once from an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pulpits of <GPE>Italy</GPE> or Egypt, if they were tuned(123) by the masterhand of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Alexandrian</NORP> primate.
 The design of this institution was laudable, but the fruits were not always salutary.
 The preachers recommended the practice of the social duties; but they exalted the perfection of monastic virtue, which is painful to the individual, and useless to mankind.
 Their charitable exhortations betrayed a secret wish that the clergy might be permitted to manage the wealth of the faithful for the benefit of the poor.
 The most sublime representations of the attributes and laws of the <PERSON>Deity</PERSON> were sullied by an idle mixture of metaphysical subtleties, puerile rites, and fictitious miracles: and they expatiated, with the most fervent zeal, on the religious merit of hating the adversaries and obeying the a ministers of the church.
 When the public peace was distracted by heresy and schism, the sacred orators sounded the trumpet of discord, and perhaps of sedition.
 The understandings of their congregations were perplexed by mystery, their passions were inflamed by invectives; and they rushed from the <NORP>Christian</NORP> temples of Antioch, or Alexandria, prepared either to suffer or to inflict martyrdom.
 The corruption of taste and language is strongly marked in the vehement declamations of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> bishops; but the compositions of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> and <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> have been compared with the most splendid models of Attic, or at least of Asiatic, eloquence.
(124) Privilege of legislative assemblies VII.
 The representatives of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> republic were regularly assembled in the spring and autumn of each year and these synods diffused the spirit of ecclesiastical discipline and legislation through the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> provinces of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 (125) The archbishop or metropolitan was empowered by the laws to summon the suffragan bishops of his province; to revise their conduct, to vindicate their rights, to declare their faith, and to examine the merit of the candidates who were elected by the clergy and people to supply the vacancies of the episcopal college.
 The primates of Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, Carthage, and afterwards Constantinople, who exercised a more ample jurisdiction, convened the numerous assembly of their dependent bishops.
 But the convocation of great and extraordinary synods was the prerogative of the emperor alone.
 Whenever the emergencies of the church required this decisive measure, he despatched a peremptory summons to the bishops or the deputies of each province, with an order for the use of post-horses and a competent allowance for the expenses A.

of their journey.
 At an early period, when <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was the protector rather than the proselyte of Christianity, he referred the <NORP>African</NORP> controversy to the council of Arles; in which the bishops of York, of Treves, of Milan, and of Carthage, met as friends and brethren, to debate in their native tongue on the common interest of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> A.

or <NORP>Western</NORP> church.
(126) Eleven years afterwards, a more numerous and celebrated assembly was convened at <GPE>Nice</GPE> in Bithynia, to extinguish, by their final sentence, the subtle disputes which had arisen in <GPE>Egypt</GPE> on the subject of the Trinity.
 Three <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighteen bishops obeyed the summons of their indulgent master; the ecclesiastics of every rank and sect and denomination have been computed at <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand and forty-eight persons; (127) the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> appeared in person; and the consent of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> was expressed by the legates of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 The session, which lasted about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months, was frequently honoured by the presence of the emperor.
 Leaving his guards at the door, he seated himself ( with the permission of the council ) on a low stool in the midst of the hall.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> listened with patience and spoke with modesty; and while he influenced the debates, he humbly professed that he was the minister, not the judge, of the successors of the apostles, who had been established as priests and as gods upon earth.
 (128) Such profound reverence of an absolute monarch towards a feeble and unarmed assembly of his own subjects can only be compared to the respect with which the senate had been treated by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes who adopted the policy of Augustus.
 Within the space of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years, a philosophic spectator of the vicissitudes of human affairs might have contemplated <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> in the senate of Rome, and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> in the council of Nice.
 The fathers of the <ORG>Capitol</ORG> and those of the church had alike degenerated from the virtues of their founders; but as the bishops were more deeply rooted in the public opinion, they sustained their dignity with more decent pride, and sometimes opposed with a manly spirit the wishes of their sovereign.
 The progress of time and superstition erased the memory of the weakness, the passion, the ignorance, which disgraced these ecclesiastical synods; and the catholic world has unanimously submitted(129) to the infallible decrees of the general councils.
