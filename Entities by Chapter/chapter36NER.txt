 Naval power of the Vandals, A.
D.
 439-455THE loss or desolation of the provinces from the <LOC>Ocean</LOC> to the <LOC>Alps</LOC> impaired the glory and greatness of Rome: her internal prosperity was irretrievably destroyed by the separation of Africa.
 The rapacious <NORP>Vandals</NORP> confiscated the patrimonial estates of the senators, and intercepted the regular subsidies which relieved the poverty and encouraged the idleness of the plebeians.
 The distress of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was soon aggravated by an unexpected attack; and the province, so long cultivated for their use by industrious and obedient subjects, was armed against them by an ambitious barbarian.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> and Alani, who followed the successful standard of Genseric, had acquired a rich and fertile territory, which stretched along the coast above ninety days' journey from <GPE>Tangier</GPE> to Tripoli; but their narrow limits were pressed and confined, on either side, by the sandy desert and the Mediterranean.
 The discovery and conquest of the <NORP>Black</NORP> nations, that might dwell beneath the torrid zone, could not tempt the rational ambition of Genseric; but he cast his eyes towards the sea; he resolved to create a naval power, and his bold resolution was executed with steady and active perseverance.
 The woods of Mount Atlas afforded an inexhaustible nursery of timber; his new subjects were skilled in the arts of navigation and shipbuilding; he animated his daring <NORP>Vandals</NORP> to embrace a mode of warfare which would render every maritime country accessible to their arms; the <LOC>Moors</LOC> and <NORP>Africans</NORP> were allured by the hopes of plunder; and, after an interval of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> centuries, the fleets that issued from the port of <GPE>Carthage</GPE> again claimed the empire of the Mediterranean.
 The success of the Vandals, the conquest of Sicily, the sack of Palermo, and the frequent descents on the coast of Lucania, awakened and alarmed the mother of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> and the sister of Theodosius.
 Alliances were formed; and armaments, expensive and ineffectual, were prepared for the destruction of the common enemy, who reserved his courage to encounter those dangers which his policy could not prevent or elude.
 The designs of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government were repeatedly baffled by his artful delays, ambiguous promises, and apparent concessions; and the interposition of his formidable confederate, the king of the Huns, recalled the emperors from the conquest of <LOC>Africa</LOC> to the care of their domestic safety.
 The revolutions of the palace, which left the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire without a defender and without a lawful prince, dispelled the apprehensions and stimulated the avarice of Genseric.
 He immediately equipped a numerous fleet of <NORP>Vandals</NORP> and Moors, and cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months after the death of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> and the elevation of <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> throne.
 The character and reign of the emperor Maximus, A.
D.
 455, March 17.
 The private life of the senator Petronius Maximus(1) was often alleged as a rare example of human felicity.
 His birth was noble and illustrious, since he descended from the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family; his dignity was supported by an adequate patrimony in land and money; and these advantages of fortune were accompanied with liberal arts and decent manners, which adorn or imitate the inestimable gifts of genius and virtue.
 The luxury of his palace and table was hospitable and elegant.
 Whenever <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> appeared in public, he was surrounded by a train of grateful and obsequious clients;(2) and it is possible that among these clients he might deserve and possess some real friend.
 His merit was rewarded by the favour of the prince and senate; he thrice exercised the office of <PERSON>Praetorian</PERSON> praefect of Italy; he was twice invested with the consulship, and he obtained the rank of patrician.
 These civil honours were not incompatible with the enjoyment of leisure and tranquillity; his hours, according to the demands of pleasure or reason, were accurately, distributed by a water-clock; and this avarice of time may be allowed to prove the sense which <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> entertained of his own happiness.
 The injury which he received from the emperor <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> appears to excuse the most bloody revenge.
 Yet a philosopher might have reflected, that, if the resistance of his wife had been sincere, her chastity was still inviolate, and that it could never be restored if she had consented tot the will of the adulterer.
 A patriot would have hesitated before he plunged himself and his country into those inevitable calamities which must follow the extinction of the royal house of Theodosius.
 The imprudent <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> disregarded these salutary considerations: he gratified his resentment and ambition; he saw the bleeding corpse of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> at his feet; and he heard himself saluted Emperor by the unanimous voice of the senate and people.
 But the day of his inauguration was the last day of his happiness.
 He was imprisoned (such is the lively expression of Sidonius) in the palace; and after passing a sleepless night, he sighed that he had attained the summit of his wishes, and aspired only to descend from the dangerous elevation.
 Oppressed by the weight of the diadem, he communicated his anxious thoughts to his friend and quaestor Fulgentius; and when he looked back with unavailing regret on the secure pleasures of his former life, the emperor exclaimed, "O fortunate Damocles, thy reign began and ended with the same dinner;" a well-known allusion, which <PERSON>Fulgentius</PERSON> afterwards repeated as an instructive lesson for princes and subjects.
 (3) His death, A.
D.
 455, June <CARDINAL>12</CARDINAL> The reign of <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> continued about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months.
 His hours, of which he had lost the command, were disturbed by remorse, or guilt, or terror; and his throne was shaken by the seditions of the soldiers, the people, and the confederate barbarians.
 The marriage of his son <PERSON>Palladius</PERSON> with the eldest daughter of the late emperor might tend to establish the hereditary succession of his family; but the violence which he offered to the empress <PERSON>Eudoxia</PERSON> could proceed only from the blind impulse of lust or revenge.
 His own wife, the cause of these tragic events, had been seasonably removed by death; and the widow of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was compelled to violate her decent mourning, perhaps her real grief, and to submit to the embraces of a presumptuous usurper, whom she suspected as the assassin of her deceased husband.
 These suspicions were soon justified by the indiscreet confession of <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> himself; and he wantonly provoked the hatred of his reluctant bride, who was still conscious that she descended from a line of emperors.
 From the East, however, <PERSON>Eudoxia</PERSON> could not hope to obtain any effectual assistance: her father and her aunt <PERSON>Pulcheria</PERSON> were dead; her mother languished at <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> in disgrace and exile; and the sceptre of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was in the hands of a stranger.
 She directed her eyes towards Carthage; secretly implored the aid of the king of the Vandals; and persuaded <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> to improve the fair opportunity of disguising his rapacious designs by the specious names of honour, justice, and compassion.
(4) Whatever abilities <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> might have shown in a subordinate station, he was found incapable of administering an empire: and though he might easily have been informed of the naval preparations which were made on the opposite shores of Africa, he expected with supine indifference the approach of the enemy, without adopting any measures of defence, of negotiation, or of a timely retreat.
 When the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> disembarked at the mouth of the Tiber, the emperor was suddenly roused from his lethargy by the clamours of a trembling and exasperated multitude.
 The only hope which presented itself to his astonished mind was that of a precipitate flight, and he exhorted the senators to imitate the example of their prince.
 But no sooner did <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> appear in the streets than he was assaulted by a shower of stones: a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or a <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> soldier claimed the honour of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wound; his mangled body was ignominiously cast into the Tiber; the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people rejoiced in the punishment which they had inflicted on the author of the public calamities; and the domestics of <PERSON>Eudoxia</PERSON> signalised their zeal in the service of their mistress.
(5) Sack of Rome, A.
D.
 455, June15-29.
 On the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day after the tumult, <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> boldly advanced from the port of <GPE>Ostia</GPE> to the gates of the defenceless city.
 Instead of a sally of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> youth, there issued from the gates an unarmed and venerable procession of the bishop at the head of his clergy.
 (6) The fearless spirit of Leo, his authority and eloquence, again mitigated the fierceness of a barbarian conqueror: the king of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> promised to spare the unresisting multitude, to protect the buildings from fire, and to exempt the captives from torture; and although such orders were neither seriously given, nor strictly obeyed, the mediation of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> was glorious to himself, and in some degree beneficial to his country.
 But <GPE>Rome</GPE> and its inhabitants were delivered to the licentiousness of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> and Moors, whose blind passions revenged the injuries of Carthage.
 The pillage lasted fourteen days and nights; and all that yet remained of public or private wealth, of sacred or profane treasure, was diligently transported to the vessels of Genseric.
 Among the spoils, the splendid relics of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> temples, or rather of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> religions, exhibited a memorable example of the vicissitudes of human and divine things.
 Since the abolition of Paganism, the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> had been violated and abandoned; yet the statues of the gods and heroes were still respected, and the curious roof of gilt bronze was reserved for the rapacious hands of Genseric.
 (7) The holy instruments of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> worship,(8) the gold table, and the gold candlestick with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> branches, originally framed according to the particular instructions of God himself, and which were placed in the sanctuary of his temple, had been ostentatiously displayed to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people in the triumph of Titus.
 They were afterwards deposited in the temple of Peace; and at the end of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred years, the spoils of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> were transferred from <GPE>Rome</GPE> to Carthage, by a barbarian who derived his origin from the shores of the Baltic.
 These ancient monuments might attract the notice of curiosity as well as of avarice.
 But the <NORP>Christian</NORP> churches, enriched and adorned by the prevailing superstition of the times, afforded more plentiful materials for sacrilege; and the pious liberality of pope Leo, who melted <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> silver vases, the gift of Constantine, each of an hundred pounds weight, is an evidence of the damage which he attempted to repair.
 In the forty-five years that had elapsed since the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion, the pomp and luxury of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were in some measure restored; and it was difficult either to escape, or to satisfy, the avarice of a conqueror who possessed leisure to collect, and ships to transport, the wealth of the capital.
 The <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ornaments of the palace, the magnificent furniture and wardrobe, the sideboards of massy plate, were accumulated with disorderly rapine: the gold and silver amounted to several thousand talents; yet even the brass and copper were laboriously removed.
 <PERSON>Eudoxia</PERSON> herself, who advanced to meet her friend and deliverer, soon bewailed the imprudence of her own conduct.
 She was rudely stripped of her jewels; and the unfortunate empress, with her <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> daughters, the only surviving remains of the great Theodosius, was compelled, as a captive, to follow the haughty Vandal, who immediately hoisted sail, and returned with a prosperous navigation to the port of Carthage.
(9) Many thousand <NORP>Romans</NORP> of both sexes, chosen for some useful or agreeable qualifications, reluctantly embarked on board the fleet of Genseric; and their distress was aggravated by the unfeeling barbarians, who, in the division of the booty, separated the wives from their husbands, and the children from their parents.
 The charity of Deogratias, bishop of Carthage,(10) was their only consolation and support.
 He generously sold the gold and silver plate of the church to purchase the freedom of some, to alleviate the slavery of others, and to assist the wants and infirmities of a captive multitude, whose health was impaired by the hardships which they had suffered in the passage from <GPE>Italy</GPE> to Africa.
 By his order, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> spacious churches were converted into hospitals: the sick were distributed in convenient beds, and liberally supplied with food and medicines; and the aged prelate repeated his visits both in the day and night, with an assiduity that surpassed his strength, and a tender sympathy which enhanced the value of his services.
 Compare this scene with the field of Cannae; and judge between <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> and the successor of St.
 Cyprian.
(11) The emperor Avitus, A.
D.
 455, July 10th.
 The deaths of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> and <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> had relaxed the ties which held the barbarians of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> in peace and subordination.
 The sea-coast was infested by the Saxons; the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> advanced from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Seine; and the ambition of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> seemed to meditate more extensive and permanent conquests.
 The emperor <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> relieved himself, by a judicious choice, from the weight of these distant cares; he silenced the solicitations of his friends, listened to the voice of fame, and promoted a stranger to the general command of the forces in Gaul.
 Avitus,(12) the stranger whose merit was so nobly rewarded, descended from a wealthy and honourable family in the diocese of Auvergne.
 The convulsions of the times urged him to embrace, with the same ardour, the civil and military professions; and the indefatigable youth blended the studies of literature and jurisprudence with the exercise of arms and hunting.
 Thirty years of his life were laudably spent in the public service; he alternately displayed his talents in war and negotiation; and the soldier of Aetius, after executing the most important embassies, was raised to the station of <PERSON>Praetorian</PERSON> praefect of Gaul.
 Either the merit of <PERSON>Avitus</PERSON> excited envy, or his moderation was desirous of repose, since he calmly retired to an estate which he possessed in the neighbourhood of Clermont.
 A copious stream, issuing from the mountain, and falling headlong in many a loud and foaming cascade, discharged its waters into a lake about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles in length, and the villa was pleasantly seated on the margin of the lake.
 The baths, the porticoes, the summer and <DATE>winter</DATE> apartments, were adapted to the purposes of luxury and use; and the adjacent country afforded the various prospects of woods, pastures, and meadows.
(13) In this retreat, where <PERSON>Avitus</PERSON> amused his leisure with books, rural sports, the practice of husbandry, and the society of his friends,(14) he received the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> diploma, which constituted him master-general of the cavalry and infantry of Gaul.
 He assumed the military command; the barbarians suspended their fury; and whatever means he might employ, whatever concessions he might be forced to make, the people enjoyed the benefits of actual tranquillity.
 But the fate of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> depended on the Visigoths; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, less attentive to his dignity than to the public interest, did not disdain to visit <GPE>Toulouse</GPE> in the character of an ambassador.
 He was received with courteous hospitality by Theodoric, the king of the Goths; but while <PERSON>Avitus</PERSON> laid the foundations of a solid alliance with that powerful nation, he was astonished by the intelligence that the emperor <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> was slain, and that <GPE>Rome</GPE> had been pillaged by the Vandals.
 A vacant throne, which he might ascend without guilt or danger, tempted his ambition:(15) and the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> were easily persuaded to support his claim by their irresistible suffrage.
 A.
D.
 455, August 15.
 They loved the person of Avitus; they respected his virtues; and they were not insensible of the advantage, as well as honour, of giving an emperor to the West.
 The season was now approaching in which the annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces was held at Arles; their deliberations might perhaps be influenced by the presence of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> and his martial brothers; but their choice would naturally incline to the most illustrious of their countrymen.
 Avitus, after a decent resistance, accepted the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> diadem from the representatives of Gaul; and his election was ratified by the acclamations of the barbarians and provincials.
 The formal consent of Marcian, emperor of the East, was solicited and obtained; but the senate, Rome, and Italy, though humbled by their recent calamities, submitted with a secret murmur to the presumption of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> usurper.
 Character of Theoderic, king of the Visigoths, A.
D.
 453-466.
 Theodoric, to whom <PERSON>Avitis</PERSON> was indebted for the purple, had acquired the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre by the murder of his elder brother Torismond; and he justified this atrocious deed by the design which his predecessor had formed of violating his alliance with the empire.
 (16) Such a crime might not be incompatible with the virtues of a barbarian; but the manners of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> were gentle and humane; and posterity may contemplate without terror the original picture of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, whom <PERSON>Sidonius</PERSON> had intimately observed in the hours of peace and of social intercourse.
 In an epistle, dated from the court of Toulouse, the orator satisfies the curiosity of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his friends, in the following description : (17)His expedition into Spain, A.
D.
 456.
 When the king of the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> encouraged <PERSON>Avitus</PERSON> to assume the purple, he offered his person and his forces as a faithful soldier of the republic.
 (21) The exploits of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> soon convinced the world that he had not degenerated from the warlike virtues of his ancestors.
 After the establishment of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in Aquitain, and the passage of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> into Africa, the Suevi, who had fixed their kingdom in Gallicia, aspired to the conquest of Spain, and threatened to extinguish the feeble remains of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> dominion.
 The provincials of <GPE>Carthagena</GPE> and Tarragona, afflicted by an hostile invasion, represented their injuries and their apprehensions.
 Count <PERSON>Fronto</PERSON> was despatched, in the name of the emperor Avitus, with advantageous offers of peace and alliance; and <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> interposed his weighty mediation to declare that, unless his brother-in-law, the king of the Suevi, immediately retired, he should be obliged to arm in the cause of justice and of Rome.
 Such a challenge urged <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> to prevent the bold designs of his enemy: he passed the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> at the head of the Visigoths; the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> served under his standard; and though he professed himself the dutiful servant of Avitus, he privately stipulated, for himself and his successors, the absolute possession of his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies, or rather the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, encountered each other on the banks of the river Urbicus, about twelve miles from Astorga; and the decisive victory of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> appeared for a while to have extirpated the name and kingdom of the Suevi.
 From the field of battle <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> advanced to Braga, their metropolis, which still retained the splendid vestiges of its ancient commerce and dignity.
(22) His entrance was not polluted with blood; and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> respected the chastity of their female captives, more especially of the consecrated virgins: but the greatest part of the clergy and people were made slaves, and even the churches and altars were confounded in the universal pillage.
 The unfortunate king of the <NORP>Suevi</NORP> had escaped to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of the ocean; but the obstinacy of the winds opposed his flight: he was delivered to his implacable rival; and Rechiarius, who neither desired nor expected mercy, received, with manly constancy, the death which he would probably have inflicted.
 After this bloody sacrifice to policy or resentment, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> carried his victorious arms as far as Merida, the principal town of Lusitania, without meeting any resistance, except from the miraculous powers of St.
 Eulalia; but he was stopped in the full career of success, and recalled from <GPE>Spain</GPE> before he could provide for the security of his conquests.
 In his retreat towards the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> he revenged his disappointment on the country through which he passed; and, in the sack of <PERSON>Polentia</PERSON> and <PERSON>Astorga</PERSON> he showed himself a faithless ally, as well as a cruel enemy.
 Whilst the king of the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> fought and vanquished in the name of Avitus, the reign of <PERSON>Avitus</PERSON> had expired; and both the honour and interest of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> were deeply wounded by the disgrace of a friend whom he had seated on the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
(23) <PERSON>Avitus</PERSON> is deposed, A.
D.
 456, October 16.
 The pressing solicitations of the senate and people persuaded the emperor <PERSON>Avitus</PERSON> to fix his residence at Rome, and to accept the consulship for the ensuing year.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> day of January, his son-in-law, <PERSON>Sidonius</PERSON> Apollinaris, celebrated his praises in a panegyric of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred verses; but this composition, though it was rewarded with a brass statue,(24) seems to contain a very moderate proportion either of genius or of truth.
 The poet, if we may degrade that sacred name, exaggerates the merit of a sovereign and a father; and his prophecy of a long and glorious reign was soon contradicted by the event.
 Avitus, at a time when the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity was reduced to a pre-eminence of toil and danger, indulged himself in the pleasures of <NORP>Italian</NORP> luxury: age had not extinguished his amorous inclinations; and he is accused of insulting, with indiscreet and ungenerous raillery, the husbands whose wives he had seduced or violated.
(25) But the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were not inclined either to excuse his faults or to acknowledge his virtues.
 The several parts of the empire became every day more alienated from each other; and the stranger of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was the object of popular hatred and contempt.
 The senate asserted their legitimate claim in the election of an emperor; and their authority, which had been originally derived from the old constitution, was again fortified by the actual weakness of a declining monarchy.
 Yet even such a monarchy might have resisted the votes of an unarmed senate, if their discontent had not been supported, or perhaps inflamed, by Count Ricimer, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the principal commanders of the barbarian troops who formed the military defence of Italy.
 The daughter of Wallia, king of the Visigoths, was the mother of Ricimer; but he was descended, on the father's side, from the nation of the Suevi:(26) his pride or patriotism might be exasperated by the misfortunes of his countrymen; and he obeyed with reluctance an emperor in whose elevation he had not been consulted.
 His faithful and important services against the common enemy rendered him still more formidable; (27) and, after destroying on the coast of <GPE>Corsica</GPE> a fleet of Vandals, which consisted of <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> galleys, <PERSON>Ricimer</PERSON> returned in triumph with the appellation of the 'Deliverer of Italy'.
 He chose that moment to signify to <PERSON>Avitus</PERSON> that his reign was at an end; and the feeble emperor, at a distance from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> allies, was compelled, after a short and unavailing struggle, to abdicate the purple.
 By the clemency, however, or the contempt of Ricimer,(28) he was permitted to descend from the throne to the more desirable station of bishop of Placentia: but the resentment of the senate was still unsatisfied; and their inflexible severity pronounced the sentence of his death.
 He fled towards the Alps, with the humble hope, not of arming the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> in his cause, but of securing his person and treasures in the sanctuary of Julian, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the tutelar saints of Auvergne.
(29) Disease, or the hand of the executioner, arrested him on the road; yet his remains were decently transported to Brivas, or Brioude, in his native province, and he reposed at the feet of his holy patron.
 (30) <PERSON>Avitus</PERSON> left only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> daughter, the wife of <PERSON>Sidonius</PERSON> Apollinaris, who inherited the patrimony of his father-in-law; lamenting, at the same time, the disappointment of his public and private expectations.
 His resentment prompted him to join, or at least to countenance, the measures of a rebellious faction in Gaul; and the poet had contracted some guilt, which it was incumbent on him to expiate by a new tribute of flattery to the succeeding emperor.
(31) Character and elevation of Majorian, A.
D.
 457.
 The successor of <PERSON>Avitus</PERSON> presents the welcome discovery of a great and heroic character, such as sometimes arise, in a degenerate age, to vindicate the honour of the human species.
 The emperor <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> has deserved the praises of his contemporaries and of posterity; and these praises may be strongly expressed in the words of a judicious and disinterested historian: Such a testimony may justify at least the panegyric of Sidonius; and we may acquiesce in the assurance that, although the obsequious orator would have flattered with equal zeal the most worthless of princes, the extraordinary merit of his object confined him, on this occasion, within the bounds of truth.
(33) <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> derived his name from his maternal grandfather, who, in the reign of the great Theodosius, had commanded the troops of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier.
 He gave his daughter in marriage to the father of Majorian, a respectable officer, who administered the revenues of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> with skill and integrity; and generously preferred the friendship of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> to the tempting offers of an insidious court.
 His son, the future emperor, who was educated in the profession of arms, displayed, from his early youth, intrepid courage, premature wisdom, and unbounded liberality in a scanty fortune.
 He followed the standard of Aetius, contributed to his success, shared, and sometimes eclipsed, his glory, and at last excited the jealousy of the patrician, or rather of his wife, who forced him to retire from the service.
 (34) Majorian, after the death of Aetius, was recalled and promoted: and his intimate connection with Count <PERSON>Ricimer</PERSON> was the immediate step by which he ascended the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 During the vacancy that succeeded the abdication of Avitus, the ambitious barbarian, whose birth excluded him from the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity, governed Italy, with the title of Patrician; resigned to his friend the conspicuous station of master-general of the cavalry and infantry, and, after an interval of some months, consented to the unanimous wish of the Romans, whose favour <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> had solicited by a recent victory over the Alemanni.
(35) He was invested with the purple at Ravenna: and the epistle which he addressed to the senate will best describe his situation and his sentiments.
 The emperor, who, amidst the ruins of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, revived the ancient language of law and liberty, which <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> would not have disclaimed, must have derived those generous sentiments from his own heart, since they were not suggested to his imitation by the customs of his age or the example of his predecessors.
(39) His salutary laws, A.
D.
 457-461.
 The private and public actions of <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> are very imperfectly known: but his laws, remarkable for an original cast of thought and expression, faithfully represent the character of a sovereign who loved his people, who sympathised in their distress, who had studied the causes of the decline of the empire, and who was capable of applying (as far as such reformation was practicable) judicious and effectual remedies to the public disorders.
 (40) His regulations concerning the finances manifestly tended to remove, or at least to mitigate, the most intolerable grievances.
 I.
 From the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> hour of his reign he was solicitous (I translate his own words) to relieve the weary fortunes of the provincials, oppressed by the accumulated weight of indictions and superindictions.
 (41) With this view, he granted an universal amnesty, a final and absolute discharge of all arrears of tribute, of all debts which, under any pretence, the fiscal officers might demand from the people.
 This wise dereliction of obsolete, vexatious, and unprofitable claims, improved and purified the sources of the public revenue; and the subject, who could now look back without despair, might labour with hope and gratitude for himself and for his country.
 II.
 In the assessment and collection of taxes <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> restored the ordinary jurisdiction of the provincial magistrates, and suppressed the extraordinary commissions which had been introduced in the name of the emperor himself or of the <PERSON>Praetorian</PERSON> praefects.
 The favourite servants who obtained such irregular powers were insolent in their behaviour and arbitrary in their demands: they affected to despise the subordinate tribunals, and they were discontented if their fees and profits did not twice exceed the sum which they condescended to pay into the treasury.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> instance of their extortion would appear incredible were it not authenticated by the legislator himself.
 They exacted the whole payment in gold: but they refused the current coin of the empire, and would accept only such ancient pieces as were stamped with the names of <PRODUCT>Faustina</PRODUCT> or the Antonines.
 The subject who was unprovided with these curious medals had recourse to the expedient of compounding with their rapacious demands; or, if he succeeded in the research, his imposition was doubled according to the weight and value of the money of former times.
 (42) III.
 "The municipal corporations (says the emperor), the lesser senates (so antiquity has justly styled them), deserve to be considered as the heart of the cities and the sinews of the republic.
 And yet so low are they now reduced, by the injustice of magistrates and the venality of collectors, that many of their members, renouncing their dignity and their country, have taken refuge in distant and obscure exile.
" He urges, and even compels, their return to their respective cities; but he removes the grievance which had forced them to desert the exercise of their municipal functions.
 They are directed, under the authority of the provincial magistrates, to resume their office of levying the tribute; but, instead of being made responsible for the whole sum assessed on their district, they are only required to produce a regular account of the payments which they have actually received, and of the defaulters who are still indebted to the public.
 IV.
 But <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> was not ignorant that these Corporate bodies were too much inclined to retaliate the injustice and oppression which they had suffered, and he therefore revives the useful office of the defenders of cities.
 He exhorts the people to elect, in a full and free assembly, some man of discretion and integrity who would dare to assert their privileges, to represent their grievances, to protect the poor from the tyranny of the rich, and to inform the emperor of the abuses that were committed under the sanction of his name and authority.
 The edifices of Rome.
The spectator who casts a mournful view over the ruins of ancient <GPE>Rome</GPE> is tempted to accuse the memory of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and <NORP>Vandals</NORP> for the mischief which they had neither leisure, nor power, nor perhaps inclination, to perpetrate.
 The tempest of war might strike some lofty turrets to the ground; but the destruction which undermined the foundations of those massy fabrics was prosecuted, slowly and silently, during a period of ten centuries; and the motives of interest, that afterwards operated without shame or control, were severely checked by the taste and spirit of the emperor Majorian.
 The decay of the city had gradually impaired the value of the public works.
 The circus and theatres might still excite, but they seldom gratified, the desires of the people: and the temples which had escaped the zeal of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> were no longer inhabited either by gods or men; the diminished crowds of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were lost in the immense space of their baths and porticoes; and the stately libraries and halls of justice became useless to an indolent generation whose repose was seldom disturbed either by study or business.
 The monuments of consular or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> greatness were no longer revered as the immortal glory of the capital; they were only esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of materials, cheaper, and more convenient, than the distant quarry.
 Specious petitions were continually addressed to the easy magistrates of <GPE>Rome</GPE> which stated the want of stones or bricks for some necessary service: the fairest forms of architecture were rudely defaced for the sake of some paltry or pretended repairs; and the degenerate Romans, who converted the spoil to their own emolument, demolished, with sacrilegious hands, the labours of their ancestor.
 Majorian, who had often sighed over the desolation of the city, applied a severe remedy to the growing evil.
(43) He reserved to the prince and senate the sole cognisance of the extreme cases which might justify the destruction of an ancient edifice; imposed a fine of fifty pounds of gold (two thousand pounds sterling) on every magistrate who should presume to grant such illegal and scandalous licence; and threatened to chastise the criminal obedience of their subordinate officers by a severe whipping and the amputation of both their hands.
 In the last instance the legislator might seem to forget the proportion of guilt and punishment; but his zeal arose from a generous principle, and <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> was anxious to protect the monuments of those ages in which he would have desired and deserved to live.
 The emperor conceived that it was his interest to increase the number of his subjects; that it was his duty to guard the purity of the marriage-bed: but the means which he employed to accomplish these salutary purposes are of an ambiguous, and perhaps exceptionable, kind.
 The pious maids who consecrated their virginity to <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> were restrained from taking the veil till they had reached their fortieth year.
 Widows under that age were compelled to form a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> alliance within the term of five years, by the forfeiture of <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> their wealth to their nearest relations or to the state.
 Unequal marriages were condemned or annulled.
 The punishment of confiscation and exile was deemed so inadequate to the guilt of adultery, that, if the criminal returned to Italy, he might, by the express declaration of Majorian, be slain with impunity.
(44) <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> prepares to invade Africa, A.
D.
 457.
 While the emperor <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> assiduously laboured to restore the happiness and virtue of the Romans, he encountered the arms of Genseric, from his character and situation their most formidable enemy.
 A fleet of <NORP>Vandals</NORP> and <LOC>Moors</LOC> landed at the mouth of the <PRODUCT>Liris</PRODUCT> or Garigliano; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops surprised and attacked the disorderly barbarians, who were encumbered with the spoils of Campania, they were chased with slaughter to their ships, and their leader, the king's brother-in-law, was found in the number of the slain.
 (45) Such vigilance might announce the character of the new reign, but the strictest vigilance and the most numerous forces were insufficient to protect the long-extended coast of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the depredations of a naval war.
 The public opinion had imposed a nobler and more arduous task on the genius of Majorian.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> expected from him alone the restitution of Africa, and the design which he formed of attacking the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> in their new settlements was the result of bold and judicious policy.
 If the intrepid emperor could have infused his own spirit into the youth of Italy; if he could have revived in the field of <LOC>Mars</LOC> the manly exercises in which he had always surpassed his equals; he might have marched against <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> at the head of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> army.
 Such a reformation of national manners might be embraced by the rising generation; but it is the misfortune of those princes who laboriously sustain a declining monarchy, that, to obtain some immediate advantage, or to avert some impending danger, they are forced to countenance, and even to multiply, the most pernicious abuses.
 Majorian, like the weakest of his predecessors, was reduced to the disgraceful expedient of substituting barbarian auxiliaries in the place of his unwarlike subjects: and his superior abilities could only be displayed in the vigour and dexterity with which he wielded a dangerous instrument, so apt to recoil on the hand that used it.
 Besides the confederates who were already engaged in the service of the empire, the fame of his liberality and valour attracted the nations of the Danube, the Borysthenes, and perhaps of the Tanais.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the bravest subjects of Attila, the Gepidae, the Ostrogoths, the Rugians, the Burgundians, the Suevi, the Alani, assembled in the plains of Liguria, and their formidable strength was balanced by their mutual animosities.
(46) They passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> in a severe winter.
 The emperor led the way on foot and in complete armour, sounding with his long staff the depth of the ice or snow, and encouraging the Scythians, who complained of the extreme cold, by the cheerful assurance that they should be satisfied with the heat of Africa.
 The citizens of <GPE>Lyons</GPE> had presumed to shut their gates: they soon implored, and experienced, the clemency of Majorian.
 He vanquished <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> in the field, and admitted to his friendship and alliance a king whom he had found not unworthy of his arms.
 The beneficial though precarious reunion of the greatest part of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> was the effect of persuasion as well as of force;(47) and the independent Bagaudae, who had escaped or resisted the oppression of former reigns, were disposed to confide in the virtues of Majorian.
 His camp was filled with barbarian allies; his throne was supported by the zeal of an affectionate people; but the emperor had foreseen that it was impossible without a maritime power to achieve the conquest of Africa.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Punic war the republic had exerted such incredible diligence that, within <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> days after the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> stroke of the axe had been given in the forest, a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> galleys proudly rode at anchor in the sea.
(48) Under circumstances much less favourable, <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> equalled the spirit and perseverance of the ancient Romans.
 The woods of the <PRODUCT>Apennine</PRODUCT> were felled, the arsenals and manufactures of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and <LOC>Misenum</LOC> were restored; <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> vied with each other in liberal contributions to the public service; and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> navy of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred large galleys, with an adequate proportion of transports and smaller vessels, was collected in the secure and capacious harbour of <GPE>Carthagena</GPE> in Spain.
(49) The intrepid countenance of <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> animated his troops with a confidence of victory; and if we might credit the historian Procopius, his courage sometimes hurried him beyond the bounds of prudence.
 Anxious to explore with his own eyes the state of the Vandals, he ventured, after disguising the colour of his hair, to visit <GPE>Carthage</GPE> in the character of his own ambassador: and <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> was afterwards mortified by the discovery that he had entertained and dismissed the emperor of the Romans.
 Such an anecdote may be rejected as an improbable fiction, but it is a fiction which would not have been imagined unless in the life of a hero.
(50) The loss of his fleet.
 Without the help of a personal interview, <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> was sufficiently acquainted with the genius and designs of his adversary.
 He practised his customary arts of fraud and delay, but he practised them without success.
 His applications for peace became each hour more submissive, and perhaps more sincere; but the inflexible <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> had adopted the ancient maxim that <GPE>Rome</GPE> could not be safe as long as <GPE>Carthage</GPE> existed in a hostile state.
 The king of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> distrusted the valour of his native subjects, who were enervated by the luxury of the South;(51) he suspected the fidelity of the vanquished people, who abhorred him as an <NORP>Arian</NORP> tyrant; and the desperate measure which he executed of reducing <GPE>Mauritania</GPE> into a desert(52) could not defeat the operations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor, who was at liberty to land his troops on any part of the <NORP>African</NORP> coast.
 But <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> was saved from impending and inevitable ruin by the treachery of some powerful subjects, envious or apprehensive of their master's success.
 Guided by their secret intelligence, he surprised the unguarded fleet in the bay of Carthagena: many of the ships were sunk, or taken, or burnt; and the preparations of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years were destroyed in a single day.
(53) After this event the behaviour of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> antagonists showed them superior to their fortune.
 The Vandal, instead of being elated by this accidental victory, immediately renewed his solicitations for peace.
 The emperor of the West, who was capable of forming great designs and of supporting heavy disappointments, consented to a treaty, or rather to a suspension of arms, in the full assurance that before he could restore his navy he should be supplied with provocations to justify a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> war.
 <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Italy</GPE> to prosecute his labours for the public happiness; and as he was conscious of his own integrity, he might long remain ignorant of the dark conspiracy which threatened his throne and his life.
 The recent misfortune of <GPE>Carthagena</GPE> sullied the glory which had dazzled the eyes of the multitude: almost every description of civil and military officers were exasperated against the Reformer, since they all derived some advantage from the abuses which he endeavoured to suppress; and the patrician <PERSON>Ricimer</PERSON> impelled the inconstant passions of the barbarians against a prince whom he esteemed and hated.
 The virtues of <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> could not protect him from the impetuous sedition which broke out in the camp near <GPE>Tortona</GPE> at the foot of the Alps.
 He was compelled to abdicate the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple; His death, A.
D.
 461, August 7.
 five days after his abdication it was reported that he died of a dysentery, (54) and the humble tomb which covered his remains was consecrated by the respect and gratitude of succeeding generations.
(55) The private character of <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> inspired love and respect.
 Malicious calumny and satire excited his indignation, or if he himself were the object, his contempt; but he protected the freedom of wit, and in the hours which the emperor gave to the familiar society of his friends he could indulge his taste for pleasantry without degrading the majesty of his rank.
(56) <PERSON>Ricimer</PERSON> reigns under the name of Severus, A.
D.
 461-467.
 It was not perhaps without some regret that <PERSON>Ricimer</PERSON> sacrificed his friend to the interest of his ambition: but he resolved in a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> choice to avoid the imprudent preference of superior virtue and merit.
 At his command the obsequious senate of <GPE>Rome</GPE> bestowed the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> title on Libius Severus, who ascended the throne of the <LOC>West</LOC> without emerging from the obscurity of a private condition.
 History has scarcely deigned to notice his birth, his elevation, his character, or his death.
 <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> expired as soon as his life became inconvenient to his patron; (57) and it would be useless to discriminate his nominal reign in the vacant interval of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years between the death of <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> and the elevation of Anthemius.
 During that period the government was in the hands of <PERSON>Ricimer</PERSON> alone; and although the modest barbarian disclaimed the name of king, he accumulated treasures, formed a separate army, negotiated private alliances, and ruled <GPE>Italy</GPE> with the same independent and despotic authority which was afterwards exercised by <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> But his dominions were bounded by the Alps; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals, <PERSON>Marcellinus</PERSON> and Agidius, maintained their allegiance to the republic, by rejecting with disdain the phantom which he styled an emperor.
 Revolt of <PERSON>Marcellinus</PERSON> in <GPE>Dalmatia</GPE> <PERSON>Marcellinus</PERSON> still adhered to the old religion; and the devout Pagans, who secretly disobeyed the laws of the church and state, applauded his profound skill in the science of divination.
 But he possessed the more valuable qualifications of learning, virtue, and courage; (58) the study of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> literature had improved his taste, and his military talents had recommended him to the esteem and confidence of the great Aetius, in whose ruin he was involved.
 By a timely flight <PERSON>Marcellinus</PERSON> escaped the rage of Valentinian, and boldly asserted his liberty amidst the convulsions of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 His voluntary or reluctant submission to the authority of <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> was rewarded by the government of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and the command of an army stationed in that island to oppose or to attack the Vandals; but his barbarian mercenaries, after the emperor's death, were tempted to revolt by the artful liberality of Ricimer.
 At the head of a band of faithful followers the intrepid <PERSON>Marcellinus</PERSON> occupied the province of Dalmatia, assumed the title of patrician of the West, secured the love of his subjects by a mild and equitable reign, built a fleet which claimed the dominion of the Hadriatic, and alternately alarmed the coasts of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and of Africa.
 (59) and of <PERSON>Aegidius</PERSON> in Gaul.
 Aegidius, the master-general of Gaul, who equalled, or at least who imitated, the heroes of ancient Rome,(60) proclaimed his immortal resentment against the assassins of his beloved master.
 A brave and numerous army was attached to his standard and though he was prevented by the arts of <PERSON>Ricimer</PERSON> and the arms of the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> from marching to the gates of Rome, he maintained his independent sovereignty beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and rendered the name of <PERSON>Aegidius</PERSON> respectable both in peace and war.
 The Franks, who had punished with exile the youthful follies of Childeric, elected the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general for their king; his vanity rather than his ambition was gratified by that singular honour; and when the nation at the end of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years repented of the injury which they had offered to the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> family, he patiently acquiesced in the restoration of the lawful prince.
 The authority of <PERSON>Aegidius</PERSON> ended only with his life, and the suspicions of poison and secret violence, which derived some countenance from the character of Ricimer, were eagerly entertained by the passionate credulity of the Gauls.
(61) Naval war of the Vandals, A.
D.
 361-467.
 The kingdom of Italy, a name to which the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire was gradually reduced, was afflicted under the reign of Ricimer, by the incessant depredations of the <NORP>Vandal</NORP> pirates.
(62) In the spring of each year they equipped a formidable navy in the port of Carthage, and <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> himself, though in a very advanced age, still commanded in person the most important expeditions.
 His designs were concealed with impenetrable secrecy till the moment that he hoisted sail.
 When he was asked by his pilot what course he should steer.
 but if <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> himself deigned to issue more precise orders, he judged the most wealthy to be the most criminal.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> repeatedly visited the coasts of Spain, Liguria, Tuscany, Campania, Lucania, Bruttium, Apulia, Calabria, Venetia Dalmatia, Epirus, Greece, and Sicily: they were tempted to subdue the island of Sardinia, so advantageously placed in the centre of the Mediterranean; and their arms spread desolation or terror from the Columns of <LOC>Hercules</LOC> to the mouth of the Nile.
 As they were more ambitious of spoil than of glory, they seldom attacked any fortified cities, or engaged any regular troops in the open field.
 But the celerity of their motions enabled them almost at the same time to threaten and to attack the most distant objects which attracted their desires; and as they always embarked a sufficient number of horses, they had no sooner landed than they swept the dismayed country with a body of light cavalry.
 Yet, notwithstanding the example of their king, the native <NORP>Vandals</NORP> and <NORP>Alani</NORP> insensibly declined this toilsome and perilous warfare; the hardy generation of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conquerors was almost extinguished, and their sons, who were born in Africa, enjoyed the delicious baths and gardens which had been acquired by the valour of their fathers.
 Their place was readily supplied by a various multitude of <LOC>Moors</LOC> and Romans, of captives and outlaws; and those desperate wretches, who had already violated the laws of their country, were the most eager to promote the atrocious acts which disgraced the victories of Genseric.
 In the treatment of his unhappy prisoners he sometimes consulted his avarice, and sometimes indulged his cruelty; and the massacre of five hundred noble citizens of <PERSON>Zante</PERSON> or Zacynthus, whose mangled bodies he cast into the Ionian Sea, was imputed by the public indignation to his latest posterity.
 Negotiations with the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 462 etc.
 Such crimes could not be excused by any provocations, but the war which the king of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> prosecuted against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was justified by a specious and reasonable motive.
 The widow of Valentinian, Eudoxia, whom he had led captive from <GPE>Rome</GPE> to Carthage, was the sole heiress of the <NORP>Theodosian</NORP> house; her eldest daughter, Eudocia, became the reluctant wife of Hunneric, his eldest son; and the stern father, asserting a legal claim which could not easily be refuted or satisfied, demanded a just proportion of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> patrimony.
 An adequate, or at least a valuable, compensation was offered by the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> emperor to purchase a necessary peace.
 <PERSON>Eudoxia</PERSON> and her younger daughter <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> were honourably restored, and the fury of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> was confined to the limits of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 The Italians, destitute of a naval force, which alone was capable of protecting their coasts, implored the aid of the more fortunate nations of the East, who had formerly acknowledged in peace and war the supremacy of Rome.
 But the perpetual division of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires had alienated their interest and their inclinations; the faith of a recent treaty was alleged; and the <NORP>Western</NORP> Romans, instead of arms and ships, could only obtain the assistance of a cold and ineffectual mediation.
 The haughty Ricimer, who had long struggled with the difficulties of his situation, was at length reduced to address the throne of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> in the humble language of a subject; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted, as the price and security of the alliance, to accept a master from the choice of the emperor of the East.
(63) It is not the purpose of the present chapter, or even of the present volume, to continue the distinct series of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> history; but a concise view of the reign and character of the emperor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> may explain the last efforts that were attempted to save the falling empire of the West.
(64) Leo, emperor of the East, A.
D.
 457-474.
 Since the death of the younger Theodosius, the domestic repose of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had never been interrupted by war or faction.
 <PERSON>Pulcheria</PERSON> had bestowed her hand, and the sceptre of the East, on the modest virtue of Marcian: he gratefully reverenced her august rank and virgin chastity; and, after her death, he gave his people the example of the religious worship that was due to the memory of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> saint.
(65) Attentive to the prosperity of his own dominions, <PERSON>Marcian</PERSON> seemed to behold with indifference the misfortunes of Rome; and the obstinate refusal of a brave and active prince to draw his sword against the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> was ascribed to a secret promise which had formerly been exacted from him when he was a captive in the power of Genseric.
(66) The death of Marcian, after a reign of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years, would have exposed the <LOC>East</LOC> to the danger of a popular election, if the superior weight of a single family had not been able to incline the balance in favour of the candidate whose interest they supported.
 The patrician <PERSON>Aspar</PERSON> might have placed the diadem on his own head, if he would have subscribed the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> creed.
(67) During <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> generations the armies of the <LOC>East</LOC> were successively commanded by his father, by himself, and by his son <PERSON>Ardaburius</PERSON> his barbarian guards formed a military force that overawed the palace and the capital; and the liberal distribution of his immense treasures rendered <PERSON>Aspar</PERSON> as popular as he was powerful.
 He recommended the obscure name of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> of Thrace, a military tribune, and the principal steward of his household.
 His nomination was unanimously ratified by the senate; and the servant of <PERSON>Aspar</PERSON> received the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the hands of the patriarch or bishop, who was permitted to express, by this unusual ceremony, the suffrage of the Deity.
(68) This emperor, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the name of Leo, has been distinguished by the title of the Great, from a succession of princes who gradually fixed in the opinion of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> a very humble standard of heroic, or at least of royal, perfection.
 Yet the temperate firmness with which <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> resisted the oppression of his benefactor showed that he was conscious of his duty and of his prerogative.
 <PERSON>Aspar</PERSON> was astonished to find that his influence could no longer appoint a praefect of Constantinople: he presumed to reproach his sovereign with a breach of promise, and, insolently shaking his purple, After this extraordinary scene, it was impossible that the reconciliation of the emperor and the patrician could be sincere; or, at least, that it could be solid and permanent.
 An army of Isaurians(70) was secretly levied and introduced into Constantinople; and while <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> undermined the authority, and prepared the disgrace, of the family of Aspar, his mild and cautious behaviour restrained them from any rash and desperate attempts, which might have been fatal to themselves or their enemies.
 The measures of peace and war were affected by this internal revolution.
 As long as <PERSON>Aspar</PERSON> degraded the majesty of the throne, the secret correspondence of religion and interest engaged him to favour the cause of Genseric.
 When <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> had delivered himself from the ignominious servitude, he listened to the complaints of the Italians; resolved to extirpate the tyranny of the Vandals; and declared his alliance with his colleague Anthemius, whom he solemnly invested with the diadem and purple of the West.
 Anthemius, emperor of the West, A.
D.
 467 -472.
 The virtues of <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> have perhaps been magnified, since the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> descent, which he could only deduce from the usurper Procopius, has been swelled into a line of emperors.
 (71) But the merit of his immediate parents, their honours, and their riches, rendered <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious subjects of the East, His father, Procopius, obtained, after his <NORP>Persian</NORP> embassy, the rank of general and patrician; and the name of <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> was derived from his maternal grandfather, the celebrated praefect, who protected, with so much ability and success, the infant reign of Theodosius.
 The grandson of the praefect was raised above the condition of a private subject by his marriage with Euphemia, the daughter of the emperor Marcian.
 This splendid alliance, which might supersede the necessity of merit, hastened the promotion of <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> to the successive dignities of count, of master-general, of consul, and of patrician; and his merit or fortune claimed the honours of a victory which was obtained on the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> over the Huns.
 Without indulging an extravagant ambition, the son-in-law of <PERSON>Marcian</PERSON> might hope to be his successor; but <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> supported the disappointment with courage and patience; and his subsequent elevation was universally approved by the public, who esteemed him worthy to reign till he ascended the throne.
 (72) The emperor of the <LOC>West</LOC> marched from Constantinople, attended by several counts of high distinction and a body of guards almost equal to the strength and numbers of a regular army: he entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> in triumph, A.
D.
 467, April 12.
 and the choice of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> was confirmed by the senate, the people, and the barbarian confederates of Italy.
(73) The solemn inauguration of <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> was followed by the nuptials of his daughter and the patrician Ricimer; a fortunate event, which was considered as the firmest security of the union and happiness of the state.
 The wealth of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires was ostentatiously displayed; and many senators completed their ruin, by an expensive effort to disguise their poverty.
 All serious business was suspended during this festival; the courts of justice were shut; the streets of Rome, the theatres, the places of public and private resort, resounded with hymenaeal song and dances: and the royal bride, clothed in silken robes, with a crown on her head, was conducted to the palace of Ricimer, who had changed his military dress for the habit of a consul and a senator.
 On this memorable occasion, Sidonius, whose early ambition had been so fatally blasted, appeared as the orator of Auvergne, among the provincial deputies who addressed the throne with congratulations or complaints.
(74) A.
D.
 468, <DATE>January</DATE> 1st.
 The calends of <DATE>January</DATE> were now approaching, and the venal poet, who had loved <PERSON>Avitus</PERSON> and esteemed Majorian, was persuaded by his friends to celebrate, in heroic verse, the merit, the felicity, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> consulship, and the future triumphs of the emperor Anthemius.
 <PERSON>Sidonius</PERSON> pronounced, with assurance and success, a panegyric which is still extant; and whatever might be the imperfections, either of the subject or of the composition, the welcome flatterer was immediately rewarded with the praefecture of Rome; a dignity which placed him among the illustrious personages of the empire, till he wisely preferred the more respectable character of a bishop, and a saint.
(75) Festival of the Lupercalia.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> ambitiously commend the piety and catholic faith of the emperor whom they gave to the West; nor do they forget to observe that, when he left Constantinople, he converted his palace into the pious foundation of a public bath, a church, and an hospital for old men.
(76) Yet some suspicious appearances are found to sully the theological fame of Anthemius.
 From the conversation of Philotheus, a <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> sectary, he had imbibed the spirit of religious toleration and the heretics of <GPE>Rome</GPE> would have assembled with impunity, if the bold and vehement censure which pope <PERSON>Hilary</PERSON> pronounced in the church of St.
 Peter had not obliged him to abjure the unpopular indulgence.
(77) Even the Pagans, a feeble and obscure remnant, conceived some vain hopes, from the indifference, or partiality, of Anthemius; and his singular friendship for the philosopher Severus, whom he promoted to the consulship, was ascribed to a secret project of reviving the ancient worship of the gods.
(78) These idols were crumbled into dust: and the mythology which had once been the creed of nations was so universally disbelieved, that it might be employed without scandal, or at least without suspicion, by <NORP>Christian</NORP> poets.
(79) Yet the vestiges of superstition were not absolutely obliterated, and the festival of the Lupercalia, whose origin had preceded the foundation of Rome, was still celebrated under the reign of Anthemius.
 The savage and simple rites were expressive of an early state of society before the invention of arts and agriculture.
 The rustic deities who presided over the toils and pleasures of the pastoral life, Pan, Faunus, and their train of satyrs, were such as the fancy of shepherds might create, sportive, petulant, and lascivious; whose power was limited, and whose malice was inoffensive.
 A goat was the offering the best adapted to their character and attributes; the flesh of the victim was roasted on willow spits; and the riotous youths, who crowded to the feast, ran naked about the fields, with leather thongs in their hands, communicating, as it was supposed, the blessing of fecundity to the women whom they touched.
 (80) The altar of <PERSON>Pan</PERSON> was erected, perhaps by Evander the Arcadian, in a dark recess in the side of the Palatine hill, watered by a perpetual fountain, and shaded by a hanging grove.
 A tradition that, in the same place, <PERSON>Romulus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Remus</PERSON> were suckled by the wolf, rendered it still more sacred and venerable in the eyes of the Romans; and this sylvan spot was gradually surrounded by the stately edifices of the Forum.
(81) After the conversion of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> still continued, in the month of February, the annual celebration of the Lupercalia; to which they ascribed a secret and mysterious influence on the genial powers of the animal and vegetable world.
 The bishops of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were solicitous to abolish a profane custom so repugnant to the spirit of Christianity; but their zeal was not supported by the authority of the civil magistrate: the inveterate abuse subsisted till the end of the fifth century, and pope Gelasius, who purified the capital from the last stain of idolatry, appeased, by a formal apology, the murmurs of the senate and people.
(82) Preparations against the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> of Africa, A.
D.
 468.
 In all his public declarations the emperor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> assumes the authority, and professes the affection of a father for his son Anthemius, with whom he had divided the administration of the universe.
 (83) The situation, and perhaps the character, of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> dissuaded him from exposing his person to the toils and dangers of an <NORP>African</NORP> war.
 But the powers of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire were strenuously exerted to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> from the Vandals; and Genseric, who had so long oppressed both the land and sea, was threatened from every side with a formidable invasion.
 The campaign was opened by a bold and successful enterprise of the praefect Heraclius.
(84) The troops of Egypt, Thebais, and <GPE>Libya</GPE> were embarked under this command and the Arabs, with a train of horses and camels opened the roads of the desert.
 <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> landed on the coast of Tripoli, surprised and subdued the cities of that province, and prepared, by a laborious march, which <PERSON>Cato</PERSON> had formerly executed, (85) to join the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> army under the walls of Carthage.
 The intelligence of this loss extorted from <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> some insidious and in.
 effectual propositions of peace: but he was still more seriously alarmed by the reconciliation of <PERSON>Marcellinus</PERSON> with the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires.
 The independent patrician had been persuaded to acknowledge the legitimate title of <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> whom he accompanied in his journey to Rome, the <NORP>Dalmatian</NORP> fleet was received into the harbours of Italy; the active valour of <PERSON>Marcellinus</PERSON> expelled the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> from the island of Sardinia; and the languid efforts of the <LOC>West</LOC> added some weight to the immense preparations of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> Romans.
 The expense of the naval armament, which <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> sent against the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> has been distinctly ascertained; and the curious and instructive account displays the wealth of the declining empire.
 The Royal demesnes, or private patrimony of the prince, supplied seventeen thousand pounds of gold; forty-seven thousand pounds of gold, and <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred thousand of silver, were levied and paid into the treasury by the <PERSON>Praetorian</PERSON> praefects.
 But the cities were reduced to extreme poverty; and the diligent calculation of fines and forfeitures, as a valuable object of the revenue, does not suggest the idea of a just, or merciful, administration.
 The whole expense, by whatsoever means it was defrayed, of the <NORP>African</NORP> campaign, amounted to the sum of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and thirty thousand pounds of gold, about five millions <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pounds sterling, at a time when the value of money appears, from the comparative price of corn, to have been somewhat higher than in the present age.
(86) The fleet that sailed from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to <GPE>Carthage</GPE> consisted of <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> hundred and thirteen ships, and the number of soldiers and mariners exceeded <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred thousand men.
 Basiliscus, the brother of the empress Verina, was intrusted with this important command.
 His sister, the wife of Leo, had exaggerated the merit of his former exploits against the Scythians.
 But the discovery of his guilt, or incapacity, was reserved for the <NORP>African</NORP> war; and his friends could only save his military reputation by asserting that he had conspired with <PERSON>Aspar</PERSON> to spare Genseric, and to betray the last hope of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 Failure of the expedition.
 Experience has shown that the success of an invader most commonly depends on the vigour and celerity of his operations.
 The strength and sharpness of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> impression are blunted by delay; the health and spirit of the troops insensibly languish in a distant climate; the naval and military force, a mighty effort which perhaps can never be repeated, is silently consumed, and every hour that is wasted in negotiation accustoms the enemy to contemplate and examine those hostile terrors which, on their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> appearance, he deemed irresistible.
 The formidable navy of <PERSON>Basiliscus</PERSON> pursued its prosperous navigation from the Thracian Bosphorus to the coast of Africa.
 He landed his troops at Cape Bona, or the promontory of Mercury, about forty miles from Carthage.
(87) The army of Heraclius, and the fleet of Marcellinus, either joined or seconded the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> lieutenant; and the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> who opposed his progress by sea or land were successively vanquished.
(88) If <PERSON>Basiliscus</PERSON> had seized the moment of consternation, and boldly advanced to the capital, <GPE>Carthage</GPE> must have surrendered, and the kingdom of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> was extinguished.
 <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> beheld the danger with firmness, and eluded it with his veteran dexterity.
 He protested, in the most respectful language, that he was ready to submit his person and his dominions to the will of the emperor; but he requested a truce of five days to regulate the terms of his submission; and it was universally believed that his secret liberality contributed to the success of this public negotiation Instead of obstinately refusing whatever indulgence his enemy so earnestly solicited, the guilty, or the credulous, <PERSON>Basiliscus</PERSON> consented to the fatal truce; and his imprudent security seemed to proclaim that he already considered himself as the conqueror of Africa.
 During this short interval the wind became favourable to the designs of Genseric.
 He manned his largest ships of war with the bravest of the <LOC>Moors</LOC> and Vandals; and they towed after them many large barks filled with combustible materials.
 In the obscurity of the night, these destructive vessels were impelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting fleet of the Romans, who were awakened by the sense of their instant danger.
 Their close and crowded order assisted the progress of the fire, which was communicated with rapid and irresistible violence; and the noise of the wind, the crackling of the flames the dissonant cries of the soldiers and mariners, who could neither command nor obey, increased the horror of the nocturnal tumult.
 Whilst they laboured to extricate themselves from the fire-ships, and to save at least a part of the navy, the galleys of <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> assaulted them with temperate and disciplined valour; and many of the Romans, who escaped the fury of the flames, were destroyed or taken by the victorious Vandals.
 Among the events of that disastrous night, the heroic, or rather desperate, courage of John, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the principal officers of Basiliscus, has rescued his name from oblivion.
 When the ship which he had bravely defended was almost consumed, he threw himself in his armour into the sea, disdainfully rejected the esteem and pity of Genso, the son of Genseric, who pressed him to accept honourable quarter, and sunk under the waves; exclaiming, with his last breath, that he would never fall alive into the hands of those impious dogs.
 Actuated by a far different spirit, Basiliscus, whose station was the most remote from danger, disgracefully fled in the beginning of the engagement, returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the loss of more than <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> of his fleet and army, and sheltered his guilty head in the sanctuary of St.
 Sophia, till his sister, by her tears and entreaties, could obtain his pardon from the indignant emperor.
 <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> effected his retreat through the desert; <PERSON>Marcellinus</PERSON> retired to Sicily, where he was assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his own captains; and the king of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> expressed his surprise and satisfaction that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves should remove from the world his most formidable antagonists.
(89) After the failure of this great expedition, <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> again became the tyrant of the sea: the coasts of Italy, Greece, and Asia, were again exposed to his revenge and avarice; <GPE>Tripoli</GPE> and <GPE>Sardinia</GPE> returned to his obedience; he added <GPE>Sicily</GPE> to the number of his provinces; and, before he died, in the fulness of years and of glory, he beheld the A.

 final extinction of the empire of the West.
(90) Conquests of the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> in <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, A.
D.
 462-472.
 During his long and active reign the <NORP>African</NORP> monarch had studiously cultivated the friendship of the barbarians of Europe, whose arms he might employ in a seasonable and effectual diversion against the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires.
 After the death of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> he renewed his alliance with the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> of Gaul; and the sons of the elder Theodoric, who successively reigned over that warlike nation, were easily persuaded, by the sense of interest, to forget the cruel affront which <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> had inflicted on their sister.
(91) The death of the emperor <PERSON>Majorian</PERSON> delivered <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> from the restraint of fear, and perhaps of honour; he violated his recent treaty with the Romans; and the ample territory of Narbonne, which he firmly united to his dominions, became the immediate reward of his perfidy.
 The selfish policy of <PERSON>Ricimer</PERSON> encouraged him to invade the provinces which were in the possession of Aegidius, his rival; but the active count, by the defence of <PERSON>Arles</PERSON> and the victory of Orleans, saved Gaul, and checked during his lifetime the progress of the Visigoths.
 Their ambition was soon rekindled; and the design of extinguishing the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire in <GPE>Spain</GPE> and <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was conceived and almost completed in the reign of Euric, who assassinated his brother Theodoric, and displayed, with a more savage temper, superior abilities both in peace and war.
 He passed the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> at the head of a numerous army, subdued the cities of <GPE>Saragossa</GPE> and Pampeluna, vanquished in battle the martial nobles of the <NORP>Tarragonese</NORP> province, carried his victorious arms into the heart of Lusitania, and permitted the <NORP>Suevi</NORP> to hold the kingdom of <GPE>Gallicia</GPE> under the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> monarchy of Spain.
(92) The efforts of <LOC>Euric</LOC> were not less vigorous or less successful in Gaul; and throughout the country that extends from the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and the Loire, <PERSON>Berry</PERSON> and <GPE>Auvergne</GPE> were the only cities or dioceses which refused to acknowledge him as their master.
 (93) In the defence of Clermont, their principal town, the inhabitants of <GPE>Auvergne</GPE> sustained with inflexible resolution the miseries of war, pestilence, and famine; and the Visigoths, relinquishing the fruitless siege, suspended the hopes of that important conquest.
 The youth of the province were animated by the heroic and almost incredible valour of Ecdicius, the son of the emperor Avitus, (94) who made a desperate sally with only eighteen horsemen, boldly attacked the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army, and, after maintaining a flying skirmish, retired safe and victorious within the walls of Clermont.
 His charity was equal to his courage: in a time of extreme scarcity <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand poor were fed at his expense; and his private influence levied an army of <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> for the deliverance of Auvergne.
 From his virtues alone the faithful citizens of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> derived any hopes of safety or freedom; and even such virtues were insufficient to avert the impending ruin of their country, since they were anxious to learn, from his authority and example, whether they should prefer the alternative of exile or servitude.
 (95) The public confidence was lost; the resources of the state were exhausted; and the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> had too much reason to believe that Anthemius, who reigned in Italy, was incapable of protecting his distressed subjects beyond the Alps.
 The feeble emperor could only procure for their defence the service of twelve thousand <NORP>British</NORP> auxiliaries.
 Riothamus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the independent kings or chieftains of the island, was persuaded to transport his troops to the continent of Gaul: he sailed up the <LOC>Loire</LOC> and established his quarters in Berry, where the people complained of these oppressive allies, till they were destroyed or dispersed by the arms of the Visigoths.
(96) Trial of Arvandus, A.
D.
 468.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the last acts of jurisdiction which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate exercised over their subjects of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was the trial and condemnation of Arvandus, the <PERSON>Praetorian</PERSON> praefect.
 Sidonius, who rejoices that he lived under a reign in which he might pity and assist a state-criminal, has expressed, with tenderness and freedom, the faults of his indiscreet and unfortunate friend.
(97) From the perils which he had escaped, <PERSON>Arvandus</PERSON> imbibed confidence rather than wisdom; and such was the various, though uniform, imprudence of his behaviour, that his prosperity must appear much more surprising than his downfall.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> praefecture, which he obtained within the term of five years, abolished the merit and popularity of his preceding administration.
 His easy temper was corrupted by flattery and exasperated by opposition; he was forced to satisfy his importunate creditors with the spoils of the province; his capricious insolence offended the nobles of Gaul; and he sunk under the weight of the public hatred.
 The mandate of his disgrace summoned him to justify his conduct before the senate; and he passed the sea of <GPE>Tuscany</GPE> with a favourable wind, the presage, as he vainly imagined, of his future fortunes.
 A decent respect was still observed for the <NORP>Praefectorian</NORP> rank; and on his arrival at <GPE>Rome</GPE> <PERSON>Arvandus</PERSON> was committed to the hospitality, rather than to the custody, of Flavius Asellus, the count of the sacred largesses, who resided in the Capitol.
 (98) He was eagerly pursued by his accusers, the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> deputies of Gaul, who were all distinguished by their birth, their dignities, or their eloquence.
 In the name of a great province, and according to the forms of <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence, they instituted a civil and criminal action, requiring such restitution as might compensate the losses of individuals, and such punishment as might satisfy the justice of the state.
 Their charges of corrupt oppression were numerous and weighty; but they placed their secret dependence on a letter which they had intercepted, and which they could prove, by the evidence of his secretary, to have been dictated by <PERSON>Arvandus</PERSON> himself.
 The author of this letter seemed to dissuade the king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> from a peace with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor: he suggested the attack of the <NORP>Britons</NORP> on the <LOC>Loire</LOC> and he recommended a division of Gaul, according to the law of nations, between the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> and the Burgundians.
 (99) These pernicious schemes, which a friend could only palliate by the reproaches of vanity and indiscretion, were susceptible of a treasonable interpretation; and the deputies had artfully resolved not to produce their most formidable weapons till the decisive moment of the contest.
 But their intentions were discovered by the zeal of Sidonius.
 He immediately apprised the unsuspecting criminal of his danger; and sincerely lamented, without any mixture of anger, the haughty presumption of Arvandus, who rejected, and even resented, the salutary advice of his friends.
 Ignorant of his real situation, <PERSON>Arvandus</PERSON> showed himself in the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> in the white robe of a candidate, accepted indiscriminate salutations and offers of service, examined the shops of the merchants, the silks, and gems, sometimes with the indifference of a spectator and sometimes with the attention of a purchaser; and complained of the times, of the senate, of the prince, and of the delays of justice.
 His complaints were soon removed.
 An early day was fixed for his trial; and <PERSON>Arvandus</PERSON> appeared, with his accusers, before a numerous assembly of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 The mournful garb which they affected excited the compassion of the judges, who were scandalised by the gay and splendid dress of their adversary: and when the praefect Arvandus, with the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> deputies, were directed to take their places on the senatorial benches, the same contrast of pride and modesty was observed in their behaviour.
 In this memorable judgment, which presented a lively image of the old republic, the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> exposed, with force and freedom, the grievances of the province; and as soon as the minds of the audience were sufficiently inflamed, they recited the fatal epistle.
 The obstinacy of <PERSON>Arvandus</PERSON> was founded on the strange supposition that a subject could not be convicted of treason, unless he had actually conspired to assume the purple.
 As the paper was read, he repeatedly, and with a loud voice, acknowledged it for his genuine composition; and his astonishment was equal to his dismay when the unanimous voice of the senate declared him guilty of a capital offence.
 By their decree he was degraded from the rank of a praefect to the obscure condition of a plebeian, and ignominiously dragged by servile hands to the public Prison.
 After a fortnight's adjournment the senate was again convened to pronounce the sentence of his death: but while he expected, in the island of Alsculapius, the expiration of the thirty days allowed by an ancient law to the vilest malefactors, (100) his friends interposed, the emperor <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> relented, and the praefect of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> obtained the milder punishment of exile and confiscation.
 The faults of <PERSON>Arvandus</PERSON> might deserve compassion; but the impunity of <PERSON>Seronatus</PERSON> accused the justice of the republic, till he was condemned and executed on the complaint of the people of Auvergne.
 That flagitious minister, the <PERSON>Catiline</PERSON> of his age and country, held a secret correspondence with the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> to betray the province which he oppressed: his industry was continually exercised in the discovery of new taxes and obsolete offences; and his extravagant vices would have inspired contempt if they had not excited fear and abhorrence.
(101) Discord of <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> and Ricimer, A.
D.
 471.
 Such criminals were not beyond the reach of justice; but whatever might be the guilt of Ricimer, that powerful barbarian was able to contend or to negotiate with the prince whose alliance he had condescended to accept.
 The peaceful and prosperous reign which <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> had promised to the <LOC>West</LOC> was soon clouded by misfortune and discord.
 Ricimer, apprehensive or impatient of a superior, retired from <GPE>Rome</GPE> and fixed his residence at Milan; an advantageous situation, either to invite or to repel the warlike tribes that were seated between the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and the Danube.
(102) <GPE>Italy</GPE> was gradually divided into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> independent and hostile kingdoms; and the nobles of Liguria, who trembled at the near approach of a civil war, fell prostrate at the feet of the patrician, and conjured him to spare their unhappy country.
 They informed him that Epiphanius, bishop of Pavia,(104) united the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove; and appeared confident that the eloquence of such an ambassador must prevail against the strongest opposition, either of interest or passion.
 Their recommendation was approved; and Epiphanius, assuming the benevolent office of mediation, proceeded without delay to <GPE>Rome</GPE> where he was received with the honours due to his merit and reputation.
 The oration of a bishop in favour of peace may be easily supposed: he argued that, in all possible circumstances, the forgiveness of injuries must be an act of mercy, or magnanimity, or prudence; and he seriously admonished the emperor to avoid a contest with a fierce barbarian, which might be fatal to himself, and must be ruinous to his dominions.
 <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> acknowledged the truth of his maxims; but he deeply felt, with grief and indignation, the behaviour of Ricimer; and his passion gave eloquence and energy to his discourse.
 But the anger of <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> evaporated in these passionate exclamations: he insensibly yielded to the proposals of Epiphanius; and the bishop returned to his diocese with the satisfaction of restoring the peace of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by a reconciliation,(105) of which the sincerity and continuance might be reasonably suspected.
 The clemency of the emperor was extorted from his weakness; and <PERSON>Ricimer</PERSON> suspended his ambitious designs till he had secretly prepared the engines with which he resolved to subvert the throne of Anthemius.
 The mask of peace and moderation was then thrown aside.
 The army of <PERSON>Ricimer</PERSON> was fortified by a numerous reinforcement of <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> and Oriental Suevi: he disclaimed all allegiance to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor, marched from <GPE>Milan</GPE> to the gates of Rome, and, fixing his camp on the banks of the Anio, impatiently expected the arrival of Olybrius, his <NORP>Imperial</NORP> candidate.
 <PERSON>Olybrius</PERSON> emperor of the West, A.
D.
 472, March 23.
 The senator Olybrius, of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, might esteem himself the lawful heir of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 He had married Placidia, the younger daughter of Valentinian, after she was restored by Genseric, who still detained her sister Eudoxia, as the wife, or rather as the captive, of his son.
 The king of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> supported, by threats and solicitations, the fair pretensions of his <NORP>Roman</NORP> ally, and assigned, as <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the motives of the war, the refusal of the senate and people to acknowledge their lawful prince, and the unworthy preference which they had given to a stranger.
(106) The friendship of the public enemy might render <PERSON>Olybrius</PERSON> still more unpopular to the Italians; but when <PERSON>Ricimer</PERSON> meditated the ruin of the emperor Anthemius, he tempted, with the offer of a diadem the candidate who could justify his rebellion by an illustrious name and a royal alliance.
 The husband of Placidia, who, like most of his ancestors, had been invested with the consular dignity, might have continued to enjoy a secure and splendid fortune in the peaceful residence of Constantinople; nor does he appear to have been tormented by such a genius as cannot be amused or occupied unless by the administration of an empire.
 Yet <PERSON>Olybrius</PERSON> yielded to the importunities of his friends, perhaps of his wife; rashly plunged into the dangers and calamities of a civil war; and, with the secret connivance of the emperor Leo, accepted the <NORP>Italian</NORP> purple, which was bestowed, and resumed, at the capricious will of a barbarian.
 He landed without obstacle (for <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> was master of the sea) either at <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> or the port of Ostia, and immediately proceeded to the camp of Ricimer, where he was received as the sovereign of the <NORP>Western</NORP> world.
(107) Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and death of Anthemius, A.
D.
 472, July 11.
 The patrician, who had extended his posts from the <NORP>Anio</NORP> to the <NORP>Milvian</NORP> bridge, already possessed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> quarters of Rome, the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the Faniculum, which are separated by the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> from the rest of the city; (108) and it may be conjectured that an assembly of seceding senators imitated, in the choice of Olybrius, the forms of a legal election.
 But the body of the senate and people firmly adhered to the cause of Anthemius; and the more effectual support of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army enabled him to prolong his reign, and the public distress, by a resistance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months, which produced the concomitant evils of famine and pestilence.
 At length <PERSON>Ricimer</PERSON> made a furious assault on the bridge of Hadrian, or St.
 Angelo; and the narrow pass was defended with equal valour by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> till the death of Gilimer, their leader.
 The victorious troops, breaking down every barrier, rushed with irresistible violence into the heart of the city, and <GPE>Rome</GPE> (if we may use the language of a contemporary pope) was subverted by the civil fury of <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> and Ricimer.
(109) The unfortunate <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> was dragged from his concealment and inhumanly massacred by the command of his son-in-law, who thus added a third, or perhaps a fourth, emperor to the number of his victims.
 The soldiers, who united the rage of factious citizens with the savage manners of barbarians, were indulged without control in the licence of rapine and murder: the crowd of slaves and plebeians, who were unconcerned in the event, could only gain by the indiscriminate pillage; and the face of the city exhibited the strange contrast of stern cruelty and dissolute intemperance.
(110) Death of Ricimer, August 20.
 Forty days after this calamitous event, the subject, not of glory, but of guilt, <GPE>Italy</GPE> was delivered, by a painful disease, from the tyrant Ricimer, who bequeathed the command of his army to his nephew Gundobald, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the princes of the Burgundians.
 In the same year all the principal actors in this great revolution were removed from the stage; and the whole reign of Olybrius, and of Olybrius, October 23.
 whose death does not betray any symptoms of violence, is included within the term of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months.
 He left <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> daughter, the off-spring of his marriage with Placidia; and the family of the great Theodosius, transplanted from <GPE>Spain</GPE> to Constantinople, was propagated in the female line as far as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> generation.
(111) Julius <PERSON>Nepos</PERSON> and <PERSON>Glycerius</PERSON> emperors of the West, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>472-475</CARDINAL> .
 Whilst the vacant throne of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was abandoned to lawless barbarians, (112) the election of a new colleague was seriously agitated in the council of Leo.
 The empress Verina, studious to promote the greatness of her own family, had married <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of her nieces to Julius Nepos, who succeeded his uncle <PERSON>Marcellinus</PERSON> in the sovereignty of Dalmatia, a more solid possession than the title which he was persuaded to accept of Emperor of the West.
 But the measures of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court were so languid and irresolute, that many months elapsed after the death of Anthemius, and even of Olybrius, before their destined successor could show himself, with a respectable force, to his <NORP>Italian</NORP> subjects.
 During that interval, Glycerius, an obscure soldier, was invested with the purple by his patron Guniobald; but the <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> prince was unable or unwilling to support his nomination by a civil war: the pursuits of domestic ambition recalled him beyond the Alps, (113) and his client was permitted to exchange the <NORP>Roman</NORP> sceptre for the bishopric of Salona.
 After extinguishing such a competitor, the emperor <PERSON>Nepos</PERSON> was acknowledged by the senate, by the Italians, and by the provincials of Gaul; his moral virtues and military talents were loudly celebrated, and those who derived any private benefit from his government announced in prophetic strains the restoration of the public felicity.
(114) Their hopes ( if such hopes had been entertained) were confounded within the term of a single year, and the treaty of peace, which ceded <GPE>Auvergne</GPE> to the Visigoths, is the only event of his short and inglorious reign.
 The most faithful subjects of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> were sacrificed by the <NORP>Italian</NORP> emperor to he hope of domestic security;(115) but his repose was soon invaded by a furious sedition of the barbarian confederates, who, under the command of Orestes, their general, were in full march from <GPE>Rome</GPE> to Ravenna.
 <PERSON>Nepos</PERSON> trembled at their approach; and, instead of placing a just confidence in the strength of Ravenna, he hastily escaped to his ships, and retired to his <NORP>Dalmatian</NORP> principality, on the opposite coast of the Hadriatic.
 By this shameful abdication he protracted his life about five years, in a very ambiguous state between an emperor and an exile, till he was assassinated at <PERSON>Salona</PERSON> by the ungrateful Glycerius, who was translated, perhaps as the reward of his crime, to the archbishopric of Milan.
(116) The patrician Orestes, A.
D.
 475.
 The nations who had asserted their independence after the death of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> were established, by the right of possession or conquest, in the boundless countries to the north of the Danube; or in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces between the river and the Alps.
 But the bravest of their youth enlisted in the army of confederates, who formed the defence and the terror of Italy;(117) and in this promiscuous multitude, the names of the Heruli, the Sciri, the Alani, the Turcilingi, and the Rugians, appear to have predominated.
 The example of these warriors was imitated by Orestes,(118) the son of Tatullus, and the father of the last <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor of the West.
 Orestes, who has been already mentioned in this history, had never deserted his country.
 His birth and fortunes rendered him <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious subjects of Pannonia.
 When that province was ceded to the Huns, he entered into the service of Attila, his lawful sovereign, obtained the office of his secretary, and was repeatedly sent ambassador to Constantinople, to represent the person and signify the commands of the imperious monarch.
 The death of that conqueror restored him to his freedom; and <PERSON>Orestes</PERSON> might honourably refuse either to follow the sons of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> into the Scythian desert, or to obey the Ostrogoths, who had usurped the dominion of Pannonia.
 He preferred the service of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> princes, the successors of Valentinian; and, as he possessed the qualifications of courage, industry, and experience, he advanced with rapid steps in the military profession, till he was elevated, by the favour of <PERSON>Nepos</PERSON> himself, to the dignities of patrician and master-general of the troops.
 These troops had been long accustomed to reverence the character and authority of Orestes, who affected their manners, conversed with them in their own language, and was intimately connected with their national chieftains by long habits of familiarity and friendship.
 At his solicitation they rose in arms against the obscure <NORP>Greek</NORP> who presumed to claim their obedience; and when Orestes, from some secret motive, declined the purple, they consented, with the same facility, His son Augustulus, the last emperor of the West, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>476</CARDINAL> to acknowledge his son <PERSON>Augustulus</PERSON> as the emperor of the West.
 By the abdication of Nepos, <PERSON>Orestes</PERSON> had now attained the summit of his ambitious hopes; but he soon discovered, before the end of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> year, that the lessons of perjury and ingratitude which a rebel must inculcate will be retorted against himself, and that the precarious sovereign of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was only permitted to choose whether he would be the slave or the victim of his barbarian mercenaries.
 The dangerous alliance of these strangers had oppressed and insulted the last remains of <NORP>Roman</NORP> freedom and dignity.
 At each revolution their pay and privileges were augmented; but their insolence increased in a still more extravagant degree; they envied the fortune of their brethren in Gaul, Spain, and Africa, whose victorious arms had acquired an independent and perpetual inheritance; and they insisted on their peremptory demand that a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> part of the lands of <GPE>Italy</GPE> should be immediately divided among them.
 Orestes, with a spirit which, in another situation, might be entitled to our esteem, chose rather to encounter the rage of an armed multitude than to subscribe the ruin of an innocent people.
 He rejected the audacious demand; and his refusal was favourable to the ambition of Odoacer, a bold barbarian, who assured his fellow-soldiers that, if they dared to associate under his command, they might soon extort the justice which had been denied to their dutiful petitions.
 From all the camps and garrisons of <GPE>Italy</GPE> the confederates, actuated by the same resentment and the same hopes, impatiently flocked to the standard of this popular leader; and the unfortunate patrician, overwhelmed by the torrent, hastily retreated to the strong city of Pavia, the episcopal seat of the holy Epiphanites.
 <PERSON>Pavia</PERSON> was immediately besieged, the fortifications were stormed, the town was pillaged; and although the bishop might labour, with much zeal and some success, to save the property of the church and the chastity of female captives, the tumult could only be appeased by the execution of Orestes.
 (119) His brother <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> was slain in an action near Ravenna; and the helpless Augustulus, who could no longer command the respect, was reduced to implore the clemency, of Odoacer.
 <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> king of Italy, A.
D.
 476-490.
 That successful barbarian was the son of Edecon; who, in some remarkable transactions, particularly described in a preceding chapter had been the colleague of <PERSON>Orestes</PERSON> himself.
 The honour of an ambassador should be exempt from suspicion; and <PERSON>Edecon</PERSON> had listened to a conspiracy against the life of his sovereign.
 But this apparent guilt was expiated by his merit or repentance: his rank was eminent and conspicuous; he enjoyed the favour of Attila; and the troops under his command, who guarded in their turn the royal village, consisted of a tribe of Sciri, his immediate and hereditary subjects.
 In the revolt of the nations they still adhered to the Huns; and, more than twelve years afterwards, the name of <PERSON>Edecon</PERSON> is honourably mentioned in their unequal contest with the Ostrogoths; which was terminated, after <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bloody battles, by the defeat and dispersion of the Sciri.
(120) Their gallant leader, who did not survive this national calamity, left <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, <PERSON>Onulf</PERSON> and Odoacer, to struggle with adversity, and to maintain as they might, by rapine or service, the faithful followers of their exile.
 <PERSON>Onulf</PERSON> directed his steps towards Constantinople, where he sullied, by the assassination of a generous benefactor, the fame which he had acquired in arms.
 His brother <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> led a wandering life among the barbarians of Noricum, with a mind and a fortune suited to the most desperate adventures; and when he had fixed his choice, he piously visited the cell of Severinus, the popular saint of the country, to solicit his approbation and blessing.
 The lowness of the door would not admit the lofty stature of Odoacer: he was obliged to stoop; but in that humble attitude the saint could discern the symptoms of his future greatness; and addressing him in a prophetic tone, The barbarian, whose daring spirit accepted and ratified the prediction, was admitted into the service of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, and soon obtained an honourable rank in the guards.
 His manners were gradually polished, his military skill was improved, and the confederates of <GPE>Italy</GPE> would not have elected him for their general unless the exploits of <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> had established a high opinion of his courage and capacity.
 (122) Their military acclamations saluted him with the title of king, but he abstained during his whole reign from the use of the purple and diadem,(123) lest he should offend those princes whose subjects, by their accidental mixture, had formed the victorious army which time and policy might insensibly unite into a great nation.
 Extinction of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>476</CARDINAL> or 479.
 Royalty was familiar to the barbarians, and the submissive people of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was prepared to obey, without a murmur, the authority which he should condescend to exercise as the vicegerent of the emperor of the West.
 But <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> had resolved to abolish that useless and expensive office; and such is the weight of antique prejudice, that it required some boldness and penetration to discover the extreme facility of the enterprise.
 The unfortunate <PERSON>Augustulus</PERSON> was made the instrument of his own disgrace; he signified his resignation to the senate; and that assembly, in their last act of obedience to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> prince, still affected the spirit of freedom and the forms of the constitution.
 An epistle was addressed, by their unanimous decree, to the emperor Zeno, the son-in-law and successor of Leo, who had lately been restored, after a short rebellion, to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne.
 They solemnly The deputies of the senate were received at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with some mark of displeasure and indignation: and when they were admitted to the audience of Zeno, he sternly reproached them with their treatment of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, <PERSON>Anthemius</PERSON> and Nepos, whom the <LOC>East</LOC> had successively granted to the prayers of Italy.
 But the prudent <PERSON>Zeno</PERSON> soon deserted the hopeless cause of his abdicated colleague.
 His vanity was gratified by the title of sole emperor, and by the statues erected to his honour in the several quarters of Rome; he entertained a friendly, though ambiguous, correspondence with the patrician Odoacer; and he gratefully accepted the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ensigns, the sacred ornaments of the throne and palace, which the barbarian was not unwilling to remove from the sight of the people.
 (124) <PERSON>Augustulus</PERSON> is banished to the <NORP>Lucullan</NORP> villa.
 In the space of twenty years since the death of Valentinian, <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> emperors had successively disappeared; and the son of Orestes, a youth recommended only by his beauty, would be the least entitled to the notice of posterity, if his reign, which was marked by the extinction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire in the West, did not leave a memorable era in the history of mankind.
(125) The patrician <PERSON>Orestes</PERSON> had married the daughter of Count Romulus, of <GPE>Petovio</GPE> in Noricum; the name of Augustus, notwithstanding the jealousy of power, was known at <PERSON>Aquileia</PERSON> as a familiar surname; and the appellations of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great founders, of the city and of the monarchy, were thus strangely united in the last of their successors.
 (126) The son or <PERSON>Orestes</PERSON> assumed and disgraced the names of <PERSON>Romulus</PERSON> Augustus; but the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> was corrupted into <PERSON>Momyllus</PERSON> by the Greeks, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> has been changed by the <NORP>Latins</NORP> into the contemptible diminutive Augustulus.
 The life of this inoffensive youth was spared by the generous clemency of Odoacer; who dismissed him, with his whole family, from the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> palace, fixed his annual allowance at <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand pieces of gold, and assigned the castle of Lucullus, in Campania, for the place of his exile or retirement.
(127) As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> breathed from the toils of the Punic war, they were attracted by the beauties and the pleasures of Campania; and the country-house of the elder <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> at <GPE>Liternum</GPE> exhibited a lasting model of their rustic simplicity.
(128) The delicious shores of the bay of <GPE>Naples</GPE> were crowded with villas; and <PERSON>Sylla</PERSON> applauded the masterly skill of his rival, who had seated himself on the lofty promontory of Misenum, that commands, on every side, the sea and land, as far as the boundaries of the horizon.
 (129) The villa of <PERSON>Marius</PERSON> was purchased within a few years, by Lucullus, and the price had increased from <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand five hundred, to more than four-score thousand, pounds sterling.
 (130) It was adorned by the new proprietor with <NORP>Grecian</NORP> arts and <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> treasures; and the houses and gardens of <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> obtained a distinguished rank in the list of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> palaces.
(131) When the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> became formidable to the seacoast, the <NORP>Lucullan</NORP> villa, on the promontory of Misenum, gradually assumed the strength and appellation of a strong castle, the obscure retreat of the last emperor of the West.
 About twenty years after that great revolution it was converted into a church and monastery, to receive the bones of St.
 Severinus.
 They securely reposed, amidst the broken trophies of <NORP>Cimbric</NORP> and <NORP>Armenian</NORP> victories, till the beginning of the tenth century; when the fortifications, which might afford a dangerous shelter to the Saracens, were demolished by the people of Naples.
(132) Decay of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> spirit.
 <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> barbarian who reigned in Italy, over a people who had once asserted their just superiority above the rest of mankind.
 The disgrace of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> still excites our respectful compassion, and we fondly sympathise with the imaginary grief and indignation of their degenerate posterity.
 But the calamities of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had gradually subdued the proud consciousness of freedom and glory.
 In the age of <NORP>Roman</NORP> virtue the provinces were subject to the arms, and the citizens to the laws, of the republic, till those laws were subverted by civil discord, and both the city and the provinces became the servile property of a tyrant.
 The forms of the constitution, which alleviated or disguised their abject slavery, were abolished by time and violence; the <NORP>Italians</NORP> alternately lamented the presence or the absence of the sovereigns whom they detested or despised; and the succession of five centuries inflicted the various evils of military licence, capricious despotism, and elaborate oppression.
 During the same period, the barbarians had emerged from obscurity and contempt, and the warriors of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and <PERSON>Scythia</PERSON> were introduced into the provinces, as the servants, the allies, and at length the masters, of the Romans, whom they insulted or protected.
 The hatred of the people was suppressed by fear; they respected the spirit and splendour of the martial chiefs who were invested with the honours of the empire; and the fate of <GPE>Rome</GPE> had long depended on the sword of those formidable strangers.
 The stern Ricimer, who trampled on the ruins of Italy, had exercised the power, without assuming the title, of a king; and the patient <NORP>Romans</NORP> were insensibly prepared to acknowledge the royalty of <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> and his barbaric successors.
 Character and reign of Odoacer, A.
D.
 476-490.
 The king of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was not unworthy of the high station to which his valour and fortune had exalted him: his savage manners were polished by the habits of conversation; and he respected, though a conqueror and a barbarian, the institutions, and even the prejudices, of his subjects.
 After an interval of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years, <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> restored the consulship of the West.
 For himself he modestly, or proudly, declined an honour which was still accepted by the emperors of the East; but the curule chair was successively filled by <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious senators;(133) and the list is adorned by the respectable name of Basilius, whose virtues claimed the friendship and grateful applause of Sidonius, his client.
(134) The laws of the emperors were strictly enforced, and the civil administration of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was still exercised by the <PERSON>Praetorian</PERSON> praefect and his subordinate officers.
 <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> devolved on the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrates the odious and oppressive task of collecting the public revenue; but he reserved for himself the merit of seasonable and popular indulgence.
(135) Like the rest of the barbarians, he had been instructed in the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy; but he revered the monastic and episcopal characters; and the silence of the catholics attests the toleration which they enjoyed.
 The peace of the city required the interposition of his praefect <PERSON>Basilius</PERSON> in the choice of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff: the decree which restrained the clergy from alienating their lands was ultimately designed for the benefit of the people, whose devotion would have been taxed to repair the dilapidations of the church.
 (136) <GPE>Italy</GPE> was protected by the arms of its conqueror; and its frontiers were respected by the barbarians of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Germany, who had so long insulted the feeble race of Theodosius.
 <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> passed the Hadriatic, to chastise the assassins of the emperor Nepos, and to acquire the maritime province of Dalmatia.
 He passed the Alps, to rescue the remains of <PERSON>Noricum</PERSON> from Fava, or Feletheus, king of the Rugians, who held his residence beyond the Danube.
 The king was vanquished in battle, and led away prisoner; a numerous colony of captives and subjects was transplanted into Italy; and Rome, after a long period of defeat and disgrace, might claim the triumph of her barbarian master.
 (137) Miserable state of Italy.
 Notwithstanding the prudence and success of Odoacer, his kingdom exhibited the sad prospect of misery and desolation.
 Since the age of Tiberius, the decay of agriculture had been felt in Italy; and it was a just subject of complaint that the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended on the accidents of the winds and waves.
(138) In the division and the decline of the empire, the tributary harvests of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> were withdrawn; the numbers of the inhabitants continually diminished with the means of subsistence; and the country was exhausted by the irretrievable losses of war, famine, (139) and pestilence.
 St.
 Ambrose has deplored the ruin of a populous district, which had been once adorned with the flourishing cities of Bologna, Modena, Rhegium, and Placentia.
(140) Pope <PERSON>Gelasius</PERSON> was a subject of Odoacer; and he affirms, with strong exaggeration, that in Aemilia, Tuscany, and the adjacent provinces, the human species was almost extirpated.
(141) The plebians of Rome, who were fed by the hand of their master, perished or disappeared as soon as his liberality was suppressed; the decline of the arts reduced the industrious mechanic to idleness and want; and the senators, who might support with patience the ruin of their country, bewailed their private loss of wealth and luxury.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of those ample estates, to which the ruin of <GPE>Italy</GPE> is originally imputed,(142) was extorted for the use of the conquerors.
 Injuries were aggravated by insults; the sense of actual sufferings was embittered by the fear of more dreadful evils; and as new lands were allotted to new swarms of barbarians, each senator was apprehensive lest the arbitrary surveyors should approach his favourite villa, or his most profitable farm.
 The least unfortunate were those who submitted without a murmur to the power which it was impossible to resist.
 Since they desired to live, they owed some gratitude to the tyrant who had spared their lives; and since he was the absolute master of their fortunes, the portion which he left must be accepted as his pure and voluntary gift.
(143) The distress of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was mitigated by the prudence and humanity of Odoacer, who had bound himself, as the price of his elevation, to satisfy the demands of a licentious and turbulent multitude.
 The kings of the barbarians were frequently resisted, deposed, or murdered, by their native subjects; and the various bands of <NORP>Italian</NORP> mercenaries, who associated under the standard of an elective general, claimed a larger privilege of freedom and rapine.
 A monarchy destitute of national union and hereditary right hastened to its dissolution.
 After a reign of fourteen years <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> was oppressed by the superior genius of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths; a hero alike excellent in the arts of war and of government, who restored an age of peace and prosperity, and whose name still excites and deserves the attention of mankind.
