 Conflict of the Saracens, <NORP>Latins</NORP> and Greeks, in Italy, A.
D.
 840-1017 The <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> great nations of the world, the Greeks, the Saracens, and the Franks, encountered each other on the theatre of Italy.
 (1) The southern provinces, which now compose the kingdom of Naples, were subject, for the most part, to the <GPE>Lombard</GPE> dukes and princes of Beneventum; (2) so powerful in war, that they checked for a moment the genius of Charlemagne; so liberal in peace, that they maintained in their capital an academy of <CARDINAL>thirty-two</CARDINAL> philosophers and grammarians.
 The division of this flourishing state produced the rival principalities of Benevento, Salerno, and Capua; and the thoughtless ambition or revenge of the competitors invited the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> to the ruin of their common inheritance.
 During a calamitous period of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred years, <GPE>Italy</GPE> was exposed to a repetition of wounds, which the invaders were not capable of healing by the union and tranquility of a perfect conquest.
 Their frequent and almost annual squadrons issued from the port of Palermo, and were entertained with too much indulgence by the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of Naples: the more formidable fleets were prepared on the <NORP>African</NORP> coast; and even the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of <GPE>Andalusia</GPE> were sometimes tempted to assist or oppose the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> of an adverse sect.
 In the revolution of human events, a new ambuscade was concealed in the Caudine Forks, the fields of <GPE>Cannae</GPE> were bedewed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time with the blood of the Africans, and the sovereign of <GPE>Rome</GPE> again attacked or defended the walls of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and Tarentum.
 A colony of <NORP>Saracens</NORP> had been planted at Bari, which commands the entrance of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf; and their impartial depredations provoked the resentment, and conciliated the union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 An offensive alliance was concluded between <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> the Macedonian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of his race, and <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> the great-grandson of Charlemagne; (3) and each party supplied the deficiencies of his associate.
 It would have been imprudent in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> monarch to transport his stationary troops of <LOC>Asia</LOC> to an <NORP>Italian</NORP> campaign; and the <NORP>Latin</NORP> arms would have been insufficient if his superior navy had not occupied the mouth of the Gulf.
 Conquest of Bari, A.
D.
 871.
 The fortress of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was invested by the infantry of the Franks, and by the cavalry and galleys of the Greeks; and, after a defence of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> emir submitted to the clemency of Lewis, who commanded in person the operations of the siege.
 This important conquest had been achieved by the concord of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West; but their recent amity was soon embittered by the mutual complaints of jealousy and pride.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> assumed as their own the merit of the conquest and the pomp of the triumph; extolled the greatness of their powers, and affected to deride the intemperance and sloth of the handful of <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> who appeared under the banners of the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> prince.
 His reply is expressed with the eloquence of indignation and truth: New provinces of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> in Italy, A.
D.
 890.
 These lofty hopes were soon extinguished by the death of Lewis, and the decay of the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> house; and whoever might deserve the honour, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors, Basil, and his son Leo, secured the advantage, of the reduction of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> The <NORP>Italians</NORP> of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were persuaded or compelled to acknowledge their supremacy, and an ideal line from Mount Garganus to the Bay of Salerno, leaves the far greater part of the kingdom of <GPE>Naples</GPE> under the dominion of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 Beyond that line, the dukes or republics of <GPE>Amalfi</GPE> (5) and Naples, who had never forfeited their voluntary allegiance, rejoiced in the neighbourhood of their lawful sovereign; and <GPE>Amalfi</GPE> was enriched by supplying <LOC>Europe</LOC> with the produce and manufactures of Asia.
 But the <GPE>Lombard</GPE> princes of Benevento, Salerno, and Capua, (6) were reluctantly torn from the communion of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world, and too often violated their oaths of servitude and tribute.
 The city of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> rose to dignity and wealth, as the metropolis of the new theme or province of Lombardy: the title of patrician, and afterwards the singular name of Catapan, (7) was assigned to the supreme governor; and the policy both of the church and state was modelled in exact subordination to the throne of Constantinople.
 As long as the sceptre was disputed by the princes of Italy, their efforts were feeble and adverse; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> resisted or eluded the forces of Germany, which descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> under the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> standard of the Othos.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and greatest of those <NORP>Saxon</NORP> princes was compelled to relinquish the siege of Bari: the second, after the loss of his stoutest bishops and barons, escaped with honour from the bloody field of Crotona.
 Defeat of Otho III, A.
D.
983.
 On that day the scale of war was turned against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> by the valour of the Saracens.
 (8) These corsairs had indeed been driven by the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> fleets from the fortresses and coasts of Italy; but a sense of interest was more prevalent than superstition or resentment, and the caliph of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> had transported <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Moslems</NORP> to the aid of his <NORP>Christian</NORP> ally.
 The successors of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> amused themselves with the belief, that the conquest of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> had been achieved, and was still preserved by the justice of their laws, the virtues of their ministers, and the gratitude of a people whom they had rescued from anarchy and oppression.
 A series of rebellions might dart a ray of truth into the palace of Constantinople; and the illusions of flattery were dispelled by the easy and rapid success of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurers.
 Anecdotes.
 The revolution of human affairs had produced in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> a melancholy contrast between the age of <PERSON>Pythagoras</PERSON> and the tenth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aera.
 At the former period, the coast of Great <GPE>Greece</GPE> (as it was then styled) was planted with free and opulent cities: these cities were peopled with soldiers, artists, and philosophers; and the military strength of Tarentum; Sybaris, or Crotona, was not inferior to that of a powerful kingdom.
 At the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> aera, these once flourishing provinces were clouded with ignorance impoverished by tyranny, and depopulated by <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> war nor can we severely accuse the exaggeration of a contemporary, that a fair and ample district was reduced to the same desolation which had covered the earth after the general deluge.
 (9) Among the hostilities of the Arabs, the Franks, and the Greeks, in the southern Italy, I shall select <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> anecdotes expressive of their national manners.

 1.
 It was the amusement of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> to profane, as well as to pillage, the monasteries and churches.
 At the siege of Salerno, a <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> chief spread his couch on the communion-table, and on that altar sacrificed each night the virginity of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> nun.
 As he wrestled with a reluctant maid, a beam in the roof was accidentally or dexterously thrown down on his head; and the death of the lustful emir was imputed to the wrath of Christ, which was at length awakened to the defence of his faithful spouse.

 The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> besieged the cities of <GPE>Beneventum</GPE> and Capua: after a vain appeal to the successors of Charlemagne, the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> implored the clemency and aid of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (11) A fearless citizen dropped from the walls, passed the entrenchments, accomplished his commission, and fell into the hands of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> as he was returning with the welcome news.
 They commanded him to assist their enterprise, and deceive his countrymen, with the assurance that wealth and honours should be the reward of his falsehood, and that his sincerity would be punished with immediate death.
 He affected to yield, but as soon as he was conducted within hearing of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> on the rampart, "Friends and brethren," he cried with a loud voice, "be bold and patient, maintain the city; your sovereign is informed of your distress, and your deliverers are at hand.
 I know my doom, and commit my wife and children to your gratitude.
" The rage of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> confirmed his evidence; and the self-devoted patriot was transpierced with a hundred spears.
 He deserves to live in the memory of the virtuous, but the repetition of the same story in ancient and modern times, may sprinkle some doubts on the reality of this generous deed.

 The recital of a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> incident may provoke a smile amidst the horrors of war.
 Theobald, marquis of <GPE>Camerino</GPE> and Spoleto, (13) supported the rebels of Beneventum; and his wanton cruelty was not incompatible in that age with the character of a hero.
 His captives of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> nation or party were castrated without mercy, and the outrage was aggravated by a cruel jest, that he wished to present the emperor with a supply of eunuchs, the most precious ornaments of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The garrison of a castle had been defeated in a sally, and the prisoners were sentenced to the customary operation.
 But the sacrifice was disturbed by the intrusion of a frantic female, who, with bleeding cheeks dishevelled hair, and importunate clamours, compelled the marquis to listen to her complaint.
 "Is it thus," she cried, "ye magnanimous heroes, that ye wage war against women, against women who have never injured ye, and whose only arms are the distaff and the loom?" <PERSON>Theobald</PERSON> denied the charge, and protested that, since the Amazons, he had never heard of a female war.
 "And how," she furiously exclaimed, "can you attack us more directly, how can you wound us in a more vital part, than by robbing our husbands of what we most dearly cherish, the source of our joys, and the hope of our posterity? The plunder of our flocks and herds I have endured without a murmur, but this fatal injury, this irreparable loss, subdues my patience, and calls aloud on the justice of heaven and earth.
" A general laugh applauded her eloquence; the savage Franks, inaccessible to pity, were moved by her ridiculous, yet rational despair; and with the deliverance of the captives, she obtained the restitution of her effects.
 As she returned in triumph to the castle, she was overtaken by a messenger, to inquire, in the name of Theobald, what punishment should be inflicted on her husband, were he again taken in arms.
 "Should such," she answered without hesitation, "be his guilt and misfortune, he has eyes, and a nose, and hands, and feet.
 These are his own, and these he may deserve to forfeit by his personal offences.
 But let my (14) lord be pleased to spare what his little handmaid presumes to claim as her peculiar and lawful property.
" Origin of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in Italy, A.
D.
 1016.
 The establishment of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the kingdoms of <GPE>Naples</GPE> and <GPE>Sicily</GPE> (15) is an event most romantic in its origin, and in its consequences most important both to <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The broken provinces of the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, were exposed to every invader, and every sea and land were invaded by the adventurous spirit of the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> pirates.
 After a long indulgence of rapine and slaughter, a fair and ample territory was accepted, occupied, and named, by the <NORP>Normans</NORP> of France: they renounced their gods for the God of the Christians; (16) and the dukes of <GPE>Normandy</GPE> acknowledged themselves the vassals of the successors of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> and Capet.
 The savage fierceness which they had brought from the snowy mountains of <GPE>Norway</GPE> was refined, without being corrupted, in a warmer climate; the companions of <PERSON>Rollo</PERSON> insensibly mingled with the natives; they imbibed the manners, language, (17) and gallantry, of the <NORP>French</NORP> nation; and in a martial age, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> might claim the palm of valour and glorious achievements.
 Of the fashionable superstitions, they embraced with ardour the pilgrimages of Rome, Italy, and the Holy Land.
 In this active devotion, the minds and bodies were invigorated by exercise: danger was the incentive, novelty the recompense; and the prospect of the world was decorated by wonder, credulity, and ambitious hope.
 They confederated for their mutual defence; and the robbers of the Alps, who had been allured by the garb of a pilgrim, were often chastised by the arm of a warrior.
 In <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these pious visits to the cavern of Mount Garganus in Apulia, which had been sanctified by the apparition of the archangel Michael, (18) they were accosted by a stranger in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> habit, but who soon revealed himself as a rebel, a fugitive, and a mortal foe of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire.
 His name was Melo; a noble citizen of Bari, who, after an unsuccessful revolt, was compelled to seek new allies and avengers of his country.
 The bold appearance of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> revived his hopes and solicited his confidence: they listened to the complaints, and still more to the promises, of the patriot.
 The assurance of wealth demonstrated the justice of his cause; and they viewed, as the inheritance of the brave, the fruitful land which was oppressed by effeminate tyrants.
 On their return to Normandy, they kindled a spark of enterprise, and a small but intrepid band was freely associated for the deliverance of Apulia.
 They passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> by separate roads, and in the disguise of pilgrims; but in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Rome</GPE> they were saluted by the chief of Bari, who supplied the more indigent with arms and horses, and instantly led them to the field of action.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conflict, their valour prevailed; but in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> engagement they were overwhelmed by the numbers and military engines of the Greeks, and indignantly retreated with their faces to .
 the enemy.
 The unfortunate <PERSON>Melo</PERSON> ended his life a suppliant at the court of Germany: his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> followers, excluded from their native and their promised land, wandered among the hills and valleys of Italy, and earned their daily subsistence by the sword.
 To that formidable sword the princes of Capua, Beneventum, Salerno, and Naples, alternately appealed in their domestic quarrels; the superior spirit and discipline of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> gave victory to the side which they espoused; and their cautious policy observed the balance of power, lest the preponderance of any rival state should render their aid less important, and their service less profitable.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> asylum was a strong camp in the depth of the marshes of Campania: but they were soon endowed by the liberality of the duke of <GPE>Naples</GPE> with a more plentiful and permanent seat.
 Foundation of Aversa, A.
D.
 1029.
 Eight miles from his residence, as a bulwark against Capua, the town of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> was built and fortified for their use; and they enjoyed as their own the corn and fruits, the meadows and groves, of that fertile district.
 The report of their success attracted every year new swarms of pilgrims and soldiers: the poor were urged by necessity; the rich were excited by hope; and the brave and active spirits of <GPE>Normandy</GPE> were impatient of ease and ambitious of renown.
 The independent standard of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> afforded shelter and encouragement to the outlaws of the province, to every fugitive who had escaped from the injustice or justice of his superiors; and these foreign associates were quickly assimilated in manners and language to the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> colony.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> leader of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> was Count Rainulf; and, in the origin of society, pre-eminence of rank is the reward and the proof of superior merit.
 (19) The <NORP>Normans</NORP> serve in Sicily, A.
D.
 1038.
 Since the conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the Arabs, the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> emperors had been anxious to regain that valuable possession; but their efforts, however strenuous, had been opposed by the distance and the sea.
 Their costly armaments, after a gleam of success, added new pages of calamity and disgrace to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> annals: <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand of their best troops were lost in a single expedition; and the victorious <NORP>Moslems</NORP> derided the policy of a nation which entrusted eunuchs not only with the custody of their women, but with the command of their men (20) After a reign of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred years, the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were ruined by their divisions.
 (21) The emir disclaimed the authority of the king of Tunis; the people rose against the emir; the cities were usurped by the chiefs; each meaner rebel was independent in his village or castle; and the weaker of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rival brothers implored the friendship of the Christians.
 In every service of danger the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were prompt and useful; and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred knights, or warriors on horseback, were enrolled by Arduin, the agent and interpreter of the Greeks, under the standard of Maniaces, governor of Lombardy.
 Before their landing, the brothers were reconciled; the union of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> was restored; and the island was guarded to the water's edge.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> led the van and the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of <GPE>Messina</GPE> felt the valour of an untried foe.
 In a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> action the emir of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> was unhorsed and transpierced by the iron arm of <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Hauteville.
 In a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> engagement, his intrepid companions discomfited the host of sixty thousand Saracens, and left the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> no more than the labor of the pursuit: a splendid victory; but of which the pen of the historian may divide the merit with the lance of the Normans.
 It is, however, true, that they essentially promoted the success of Maniaces, who reduced <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> cities, and the greater part of Sicily, under the obedience of the emperor.
 But his military fame was sullied by ingratitude and tyranny.
 In the division of the spoils, the deserts of his brave auxiliaries were forgotten; and neither their avarice nor their pride could brook this injurious treatment.
 They complained by the mouth of their interpreter: their complaint was disregarded; their interpreter was scourged; the sufferings were his; the insult and resentment belonged to those whose sentiments he had delivered.
 Yet they dissembled till they had obtained, or stolen, a safe passage to the <NORP>Italian</NORP> continent: their brethren of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> sympathized in their indignation, and the province of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invaded as the forfeit of the debt.
 (22) Their conquest of Apulia, A.
D.
 1040-1043.
 Above <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> after the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emigration, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> took the field with no more than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred horse and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred foot; and after the recall of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> legions (23) from the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> war, their numbers are magnified to the amount of threescore thousand men.
 Their herald proposed the option of battle or retreat; "of battle," was the unanimous cry of the Normans; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their stoutest warriors, with a stroke of his fist, felled to the ground the horse of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> messenger.
 He was dismissed with a fresh horse; the insult was concealed from the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops; but in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> successive battles they were more fatally instructed of the prowess of their adversaries.
 In the plains of Cannae, the <NORP>Asiatics</NORP> fled before the adventurers of France; the duke of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> was made prisoner; the <NORP>Apulians</NORP> acquiesced in a new dominion; and the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> places of Bari, Otranto, Brundusium, and Tarentum, were alone saved in the shipwreck of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> fortunes.
 From this aera we may date the establishment of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> power, which soon eclipsed the infant colony of Aversa.
 <CARDINAL>Twelve</CARDINAL> counts (24) were chosen by the popular suffrage; and age, birth, and merit, were the motives of their choice.
 The tributes of their peculiar districts were appropriated to their use; and each count erected a fortress in the midst of his lands, and at the head of his vassals.
 In the centre of the province, the common habitation of <ORG>Melphi</ORG> was reserved as the metropolis and citadel of the republic; a house and separate <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> was allotted to each of the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> counts: and the national concerns were regulated by this military senate.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of his peers, their president and general, was entitled count of Apulia; and this dignity was conferred on <PERSON>William</PERSON> of the iron arm, who, in the language of the age, is styled a lion in battle, a lamb in society, and an angel in council.
 (25) Character of the Normans.
 The manners of his countrymen are fairly delineated by a contemporary and national historian.
 (26) "The Normans," says Malaterra, "are a cunning and revengeful people; eloquence and dissimulation appear to be their hereditary qualities: they can stoop to flatter; but unless they are curbed by the restraint of law, they indulge the licentiousness of nature and passion.
 Their princes affect the praises of popular munificence; the people observe the medium, or rather blend the extremes, of avarice and prodigality; and in their eager thirst of wealth and dominion, they despise whatever they possess, and hope whatever they desire.
 Arms and horses, the luxury of dress, the exercises of hunting and hawking (27) are the delight of the Normans; but, on pressing occasions, they can endure with incredible patience the inclemency of every climate, and the toil and absence of a military life.
" (28) Oppression of Apulia,A.
D.
 1046 etc.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> were seated on the verge of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires; and, according to the policy of the hour, they accepted the investiture of their lands, from the sovereigns of <GPE>Germany</GPE> or Constantinople.
 But the firmest title of these adventurers was the right of conquest: they neither loved nor trusted; they were neither trusted nor beloved: the contempt of the princes was mixed with fear, and the fear of the natives was mingled with hatred and resentment.
 Every object of desire, a horse, a woman, a garden, tempted and gratified the rapaciousness of the strangers; (29) and the avarice of their chiefs was only colored by the more specious names of ambition and glory.
 The <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> counts were sometimes joined in the league of injustice: in their domestic quarrels they disputed the spoils of the people: the virtues of <PERSON>William</PERSON> were buried in his grave; and Drogo, his brother and successor, was better qualified to lead the valour, than to restrain the violence, of his peers.
 Under the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> Monomachus, the policy, rather than benevolence, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court, attempted to relieve <GPE>Italy</GPE> from this adherent mischief, more grievous than a flight of Barbarians; (30) and Argyrus, the son of Melo, was invested for this purpose with the most lofty titles (31) and the most ample commission.
 The memory of his father might recommend him to the Normans; and he had already engaged their voluntary service to quell the revolt of Maniaces, and to avenge their own and the public injury.
 It was the design of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to transplant the warlike colony from the <NORP>Italian</NORP> provinces to the Persian war; and the son of <PERSON>Melo</PERSON> distributed among the chiefs the gold and manufactures of Greece, as the first-fruits of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> bounty.
 But his arts were baffled by the sense and spirit of the conquerors of Apulia: his gifts, or at least his proposals, were rejected; and they unanimously refused to relinquish their possessions and their hopes for the distant prospect of <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> fortune.
 League of the Pope and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, A.
D.
 1049-1054.
 After the means of persuasion had failed, <PERSON>Argyrus</PERSON> resolved to compel or to destroy: the <NORP>Latin</NORP> powers were solicited against the common enemy; and an offensive alliance was formed of the pope and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West.
 The throne of St.
 Peter was occupied by <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, a simple saint, (32) of a temper most apt to deceive himself and the world, and whose venerable character would consecrate with the name of piety the measures least compatible with the practice of religion.
 His humanity was affected by the complaints, perhaps the calumnies, of an injured people: the impious <NORP>Normans</NORP> had interrupted the payment of tithes; and the temporal sword might be lawfully unsheathed against the sacrilegious robbers, who were deaf to the censures of the church.
 As a <NORP>German</NORP> of noble birth and royal kindred, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> had free access to the court and confidence of the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Third; and in search of arms and allies, his ardent zeal transported him from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> to Saxony, from the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> to the Tyber.
 During these hostile preparations, <PERSON>Argyrus</PERSON> indulged himself in the use of secret and guilty weapons: a crowd of <NORP>Normans</NORP> became the victims of public or private revenge; A.
D.
 1051and the valiant <PERSON>Drogo</PERSON> was murdered in a church.
 But his spirit survived in his brother Humphrey, the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> count of Apulia.
 The assassins were chastised; and the son of Melo, overthrown and wounded, was driven from the field, to hide his shame behind the walls of Bari, and to await the tardy succour of his allies.
 Expedition of pope <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> IX.
 Against the Normans, A.
D.
 1053.
 But the power of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was distracted by a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> war; the mind of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was feeble and irresolute; and the pope, instead of repassing the <LOC>Alps</LOC> with a <NORP>German</NORP> army, was accompanied only by a guard of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Swabians</NORP> and some volunteers of Lorraine.
 In his long progress from <GPE>Mantua</GPE> to Beneventum, a vile and promiscuous multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> was enlisted under the holy standard: (33) the priest and the robber slept in the same tent; the pikes and crosses were intermingled in the front; and the martial saint repeated the lessons of his youth in the order of march, of encampment, and of combat.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> could muster in the field no more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand horse, with a handful of infantry: the defection of the natives intercepted their provisions and retreat; and their spirit, incapable of fear, was chilled for a moment by superstitious awe.
 On the hostile approach of Leo, they knelt without disgrace or reluctance before their spiritual father.
 But the pope was inexorable; his lofty <NORP>Germans</NORP> affected to deride the diminutive stature of their adversaries; and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were informed that death or exile was their only alternative.
 Flight they disdained, and, as many of them had been <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days without tasting food, they embraced the assurance of a more easy and honourable death.
 They climbed the hill of Civitella, descended into the plain, and charged in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> divisions the army of the pope.
 His defeat and captivity, June 18.
 On the left, and in the centre, <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> count of Aversa, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> the famous Guiscard, attacked, broke, routed, and pursued the <NORP>Italian</NORP> multitudes, who fought without discipline, and fled without shame.
 A harder trial was reserved for the valour of Count Humphrey, who led the cavalry of the right wing.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> (34) have been described as unskillful in the management of the horse and the lance, but on foot they formed a strong and impenetrable phalanx; and neither man, nor steed, nor armour, could resist the weight of their long and two-handed swords.
 After a severe conflict, they were encompassed by the squadrons returning from the pursuit; and died in the ranks with the esteem of their foes, and the satisfaction of revenge.
 The gates of <PERSON>Civitella</PERSON> were shut against the flying pope, and he was overtaken by the pious conquerors, who kissed his feet, to implore his blessing and the absolution of their sinful victory.
 The soldiers beheld in their enemy and captive the vicar of Christ; and, though we may suppose the policy of the chiefs, it is probable that they were infected by the popular superstition.
 In the calm of retirement, the well-meaning pope deplored the effusion of <NORP>Christian</NORP> blood, which must be imputed to his account: he felt, that he had been the author of sin and scandal; and as his undertaking had failed, the indecency of his military character was universally condemned.
 (35) With these dispositions, he listened to the offers of a beneficial treaty; deserted an alliance which he had preached as the cause of God; and ratified the past and future conquests of the Normans.
 Origin of the papal investitures to the Normans.
 By whatever hands they had been usurped, the provinces of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were a part of the donation of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and the patrimony of St.
 Peter: the grant and the acceptance confirmed the mutual claims of the pontiff and the adventurers.
 They promised to support each other with spiritual and temporal arms; a tribute or quitrent of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> pence was afterwards stipulated for every ploughland; and since this memorable transaction, the kingdom of <GPE>Naples</GPE> has remained above <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred <DATE>years</DATE> a fief of the Holy See.
 (36) Birth and character of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, A.
D.
 1020-1085.
 The pedigree of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> (37) is variously deduced from the peasants and the dukes of Normandy: from the peasants, by the pride and ignorance of a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> princess; (38) from the dukes, by the ignorance and flattery of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> subjects.
 (39) His genuine descent may be ascribed to the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> or middle order of private nobility.
 (40) He sprang from a race of valvassors or bannerets, of the diocese of Coutances, in the Lower Normandy: the castle of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was their honourable seat: his father <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> was conspicuous in the court and army of the duke; and his military service was furnished by <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> soldiers or knights.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> marriages, of a rank not unworthy of his own, made him the father of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> sons, who were educated at home by the impartial tenderness of his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife.
 But a narrow patrimony was insufficient for this numerous and daring progeny; they saw around the neighbourhood the mischiefs of poverty and discord, and resolved to seek in foreign wars a more glorious inheritance.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> only remained to perpetuate the race, and cherish their father's age: their <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> brothers, as they successfully attained the vigour of manhood, departed from the castle, passed the Alps, and joined the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> camp of the Normans.
 The elder were prompted by native spirit; their success encouraged their younger brethren, and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> in seniority, William, Drogo, and Humphrey, deserved to be the chiefs of their nation and the founders of the new republic.
 <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was the eldest of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> sons of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> marriage; and even the reluctant praise of his foes has endowed him with the heroic qualities of a soldier and a statesman.
 His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army: his limbs were cast in the true proportion of strength and gracefulness; and to the decline of life, he maintained the patient vigour of health and the commanding dignity of his form.
 His complexion was ruddy, his shoulders were broad, his hair and beard were long and of a flaxen colour, his eyes sparkled with fire, and his voice, like that of Achilles, could impress obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle.
 In the ruder ages of chivalry, such qualifications are not below the notice of the poet or historians: they may observe that Robert, at once, and with equal dexterity, could wield in the right hand his sword, his lance in the left; that in the battle of <PERSON>Civitella</PERSON> he was thrice unhorsed; and that in the close of that memorable day he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valour from the warriors of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies.
 (41) His boundless ambition was founded on the consciousness of superior worth: in the pursuit of greatness, he was never arrested by the scruples of justice, and seldom moved by the feelings of humanity: though not insensible of fame, the choice of open or clandestine means was determined only by his present advantage.
 The surname of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> (42) was applied to this master of political wisdom, which is too often confounded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is praised by the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> poet for excelling the cunning of <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> and the eloquence of Cicero.
 Yet these arts were disguised by an appearance of military frankness: in his highest fortune, he was accessible and courteous to his fellow-soldiers; and while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects, he affected in his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion of his country.
 He grasped with a rapacious, that he might distribute with a liberal, hand: his primitive indigence had taught the habits of frugality; the gain of a merchant was not below his attention; and his prisoners were tortured with slow and unfeeling cruelty, to force a discovery of their secret treasure.
 According to the Greeks, he departed from <GPE>Normandy</GPE> with only <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> followers on horseback and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> on foot; yet even this allowance appears too bountiful: the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> as a pilgrim; and his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> military band was levied among the adventurers of Italy.
 His brothers and countrymen had divided the fertile lands of Apulia; but they guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice; the aspiring youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria, and in his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploits against the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the natives, it is not easy to discriminate the hero from the robber.
 To surprise a castle or a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to plunder the adjacent villages for necessary food, were the obscure labours which formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body.
 The volunteers of <GPE>Normandy</GPE> adhered to his standard; and, under his command, the peasants of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> assumed the name and character of Normans.
 His ambition and success, A.
D.
 1054-1080.
 As the genius of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> expanded with his fortune, he awakened the jealousy of his elder brother, by whom, in a transient quarrel, his life was threatened and his liberty restrained.
 After the death of Humphrey, the tender age of his sons excluded them from the command; they were reduced to a private estate, by the ambition of their guardian and uncle; and <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was exalted on a buckler, and saluted count of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and general of the republic.
 With an increase of authority and of force, he resumed the conquest of Calabria, and soon aspired to a rank that should raise him forever above the heads of his equals.
 By some acts of rapine or sacrilege, he had incurred a papal excommunication; but <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> was easily persuaded that the divisions of friends could terminate only in their mutual prejudice; that the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were the faithful champions of the Holy See; and it was safer to trust the alliance of a prince than the caprice of an aristocracy.
 A synod of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred bishops was convened at Melphi; and the count interrupted an important enterprise to guard the person and execute the decrees of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 His gratitude and policy conferred on <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and his posterity the ducal title, (43) with the investiture of Apulia, Calabria, and all the lands, both in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, which his sword could rescue from the schismatic <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the unbelieving Saracens.
 (44) This apostolic sanction might justify his arms; but the obedience of a free and victorious people could not be transferred without their consent; and <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> dissembled his elevation till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by the conquest of <PERSON>Consenza</PERSON> and Reggio.
 In the hour of triumph, he assembled his troops, and solicited the <NORP>Normans</NORP> to confirm by their suffrage the judgment of the vicar of Christ: Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1060.
 the soldiers hailed with joyful acclamations their valiant duke; and the counts, his former equals, pronounced the oath of fidelity with hollow smiles and secret indignation.
 After this inauguration, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> styled himself, "By the grace of God and St.
 Peter, duke of Apulia, Calabria, and hereafter of Sicily;" and it was the labour of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> to deserve and realize these lofty appellations.
 Such tardy progress, in a narrow space, may seem unworthy of the abilities of the chief and the spirit of the nation; but the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were few in number; their resources were scanty; their service was voluntary and precarious.
 The bravest designs of the duke were sometimes opposed by the free voice of his parliament of barons: the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> counts of popular election conspired against his authority; and against their perfidious uncle, the sons of <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> demanded justice and revenge.
 By his policy and vigour, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> discovered their plots, suppressed their rebellions, and punished the guilty with death or exile: but in these domestic feuds, his years, and the national strength, were unprofitably consumed.
 After the defeat of his foreign enemies, the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, their broken forces retreated to the strong and populous cities of the sea-coast.
 They excelled in the arts of fortification and defence; the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were accustomed to serve on horseback in the field, and their rude attempts could only succeed by the efforts of persevering courage.
 The resistance of <GPE>Salerno</GPE> was maintained above eight months; the siege or blockade of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> lasted near <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years.
 In these actions the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke was the foremost in every danger; in every fatigue the last and most patient.
 As he pressed the citadel of Salerno, a huge stone from the rampart shattered <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his military engines; and by a splinter he was wounded in the breast.
 Before the gates of Bari, he lodged in a miserable hut or barrack, composed of dry branches, and thatched with straw; a perilous station, on all sides open to the inclemency of the <DATE>winter</DATE> and the spears of the enemy.
 (45) His <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> correspond with the limits of the present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his arms have not been dissevered by the revolutions of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred years.
 (46) The monarchy has been composed of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> provinces of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> and Apulia, of the <GPE>Lombard</GPE> principality of Salerno, the republic of Amalphi, and the inland dependencies of the large and ancient duchy of Beneventum.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> districts only were exempted from the common law of subjection; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> forever, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> last till the middle of the succeeding century.
 The city and immediate territory of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> had been transferred, by gift or exchange, from the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; and although this holy land was sometimes invaded, the name of St.
 Peter was finally more potent than the sword of the Normans.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> colony of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> subdued and held the state of Capua; and her princes were reduced to beg their bread before the palace of their fathers.
 The dukes of Naples, the present metropolis, maintained the popular freedom, under the shadow of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 Among the new acquisitions of Guiscard, the science of Salerno, (47) and the trade of Amalphi, (48) may detain for a moment the curiosity of the reader.
 School of Salerno.
 I.
 Of the learned faculties, jurisprudence implies the previous establishment of laws and property; and theology may perhaps be superseded by the full light of religion and reason.
 But the savage and the sage must alike implore the assistance of physic; and, if our diseases are inflamed by luxury, the mischiefs of blows and wounds would be more frequent in the ruder ages of society.
 The treasures of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> medicine had been communicated to the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> colonies of Africa, Spain, and Sicily; and in the intercourse of peace and war, a spark of knowledge had been kindled and cherished at Salerno, an illustrious city, in which the men were honest and the women beautiful.
 (49) A school, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> that arose in the darkness of Europe, was consecrated to the healing art: the conscience of monks and bishops was reconciled to that salutary and lucrative profession; and a crowd of patients, of the most eminent rank, and most distant climates, invited or visited the physicians of Salerno.
 They were protected by the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquerors; and Guiscard, though bred in arms, could discern the merit and value of a philosopher.
 After a pilgrimage of thirty-nine years, Constantine, an <NORP>African</NORP> Christian, returned from Bagdad, a master of the language and learning of the Arabians; and <GPE>Salerno</GPE> was enriched by the practice, the lessons, and the writings of the pupil of Avicenna.
 The school of medicine has long slept in the name of a university; but her precepts are abridged in a string of aphorisms, bound together in the <NORP>Leonine</NORP> verses, or <NORP>Latin</NORP> rhymes, of the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> century.
 (50) Trade of Amalphi.
 II.
 Seven miles to the west of Salerno, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> to the south of Naples, the obscure town of <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> displayed the power and rewards of industry.
 The land, however fertile, was of narrow extent; but the sea was accessible and open: the inhabitants <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assumed the office of supplying the western world with the manufactures and productions of the East; and this useful traffic was the source of their opulence and freedom.
 The government was popular, under the administration of a duke and the supremacy of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 Fifty thousand citizens were numbered in the walls of Amalphi; nor was any city more abundantly provided with gold, silver, and the objects of precious luxury.
 The mariners who swarmed in her port, excelled in the theory and practice of navigation and astronomy: and the discovery of the compass, which has opened the globe, is owing to their ingenuity or good fortune.
 Their trade was extended to the coasts, or at least to the commodities, of Africa, Arabia, and India: and their settlements in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, acquired the privileges of independent colonies.
 (51) After <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <DATE>years</DATE> of prosperity, <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> was oppressed by the arms of the Normans, and sacked by the jealousy of Pisa; but the poverty of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand fisherman is yet dignified by the remains of an arsenal, a cathedral, and the palaces of royal merchants.
 Conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by count Roger, A.
D.
 1060-1090.
 Roger, the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> and last of the sons of Tancred, had been long detained in <GPE>Normandy</GPE> by his own and his father' age.
 He accepted the welcome summons; hastened to the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> camp; and deserved at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> the esteem, and afterwards the envy, of his elder brother.
 Their valour and ambition were equal; but the youth, the beauty, the elegant manners, of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> engaged the disinterested love of the soldiers and people.
 So scanty was his allowance for himself and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> followers, that he descended from conquest to robbery, and from robbery to domestic theft; and so loose were the notions of property, that, by his own historian, at his special command, he is accused of stealing horses from a stable at Melphi.
 (52) His spirit emerged from poverty and disgrace: from these base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy war; and the invasion of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was seconded by the zeal and policy of his brother Guiscard.
 After the retreat of the Greeks, the idolaters, a most audacious reproach of the Catholics, had retrieved their losses and possessions; but the deliverance of the island, so vainly undertaken by the forces of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, was achieved by a small and private band of adventurers.
 (53) In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attempt, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> braved, in an open boat, the real and fabulous dangers of <PRODUCT>Scylla</PRODUCT> and Charybdis; landed with only sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; drove the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> to the gates of <GPE>Messina</GPE> and safely returned with the spoils of the adjacent country.
 In the fortress of Trani, his active and patient courage were equally conspicuous.
 In his old age he related with pleasure, that, by the distress of the siege, himself, and the countess his wife, had been reduced to a single cloak or mantle, which they wore alternately; that in a sally his horse had been slain, and he was dragged away by the Saracens; but that he owed his rescue to his good sword, and had retreated with his saddle on his back, lest the meanest trophy might be left in the hands of the miscreants.
 In the siege of Trani, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Normans</NORP> withstood and repulsed the forces of the island.
 In the field of Ceramio, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand horse and foot were overthrown by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> soldiers, without reckoning St.
 George, who fought on horseback in the foremost ranks.
 The captive banners, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> camels, were reserved for the successor of St.
 Peter; and had these barbaric spoils been exposed, not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol, they might have revived the memory of the <NORP>Punic</NORP> triumphs.
 These insufficient numbers of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> most probably denote their knights, the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank, each of whom was attended by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> followers in the field; (54) yet, with the aid of this interpretation, and after every fair allowance on the side of valour, arms, and reputation, the discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce the prudent reader to the alternative of a miracle or a fable.
 The <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> derived a frequent and powerful succour from their countrymen of Africa: in the siege of Palermo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry was assisted by the galleys of Pisa; and, in the hour of action, the envy of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers was sublimed to a generous and invincible emulation.
 After a war of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, (55) Roger, with the title of great count, obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most fruitful island of the Mediterranean; and his administration displays a liberal and enlightened mind, above the limits of his age and education.
 The <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were maintained in the free enjoyment of their religion and property: (56) a philosopher and physician of Mazara, of the race of Mahomet, harangued the conqueror, and was invited to court; his geography of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> climates was translated into Latin; and Roger, after a diligent perusal, preferred the work of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> to the writings of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> Ptolemy.
 (57) A remnant of <NORP>Christian</NORP> natives had promoted the success of the Normans: they were rewarded by the triumph of the cross.
 The island was restored to the jurisdiction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; new bishops were planted in the principal cities; and the clergy was satisfied by a liberal endowment of churches and monasteries.
 Yet the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> hero asserted the rights of the civil magistrate.
 Instead of resigning the investiture of benefices, he dexterously applied to his own profit the papal claims: the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged, by the singular bull, which declares the princes of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> hereditary and perpetual legates of the Holy See.
 (58) <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> invades the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1081.
 To <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was more glorious than beneficial: the possession of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> was inadequate to his ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> occasion of invading, perhaps of subduing, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire of the East.
 (59) From his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife, the partner of his humble fortune, he had been divorced under the pretence of consanguinity; and her son <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was destined to imitate, rather than to succeed, his illustrious father.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger; their <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> daughters were given in honorable nuptials, (60) and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of them was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a beautiful youth, the son and heir of the emperor Michael.
 (61) But the throne of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was shaken by a revolution: the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> family of <PERSON>Ducas</PERSON> was confined to the palace or the cloister; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> deplored, and resented, the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally.
 A Greek, who styled himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared at Salerno, and related the adventures of his fall and flight.
 That unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the pomp and titles of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity: in his triumphal progress through <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> (62) was saluted with the tears and acclamations of the people; and Pope <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> exhorted the bishops to preach, and the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> to fight, in the pious work of his restoration.
 His conversations with <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> were frequent and familiar; and their mutual promises were justified by the valour of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and the treasures of the East.
 Yet this Michael, by the confession of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, was a pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled from his convent, or a domestic who had served in the palace.
 The fraud had been contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after this pretender had given a decent colour to his arms, he would sink, at the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity.
 But victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks; and the ardour of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> was much inferior to their credulity: the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> veterans wished to enjoy the harvest of their toils, and the unwarlike <NORP>Italians</NORP> trembled at the known and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition.
 In his new levies, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> exerted the influence of gifts and promises, the terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some acts of violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy were pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting prince.
 After <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years' incessant preparations the land and naval forces were assembled at Otranto, at the heel, or extreme promontory, of Italy; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was accompanied by his wife, who fought by his side, his son Bohemond, and the representative of the emperor Michael.
 Thirteen hundred knights (63) of <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> race or discipline, formed the sinews of the army, which might be swelled to <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand (64) followers of every denomination.
 The men, the horses, the arms, the engines, the wooden towers, covered with raw hides, were embarked on board <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> vessels: the transports had been built in the ports of Italy, and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the republic of Ragusa.
 Siege of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, June 17.
 At the mouth of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf, the shores of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Epirus</LOC> incline towards each other.
 The space between <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> and Durazzo, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> passage, is no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles; (65) at the last station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; (66) and this narrow distance had suggested to <PERSON>Pyrrhus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> the sublime or extravagant idea of a bridge.
 Before the general embarkation, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke despatched <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> with <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> galleys to seize or threaten the Isle of Corfu, to survey the opposite coast, and to secure a harbour in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Vallona</GPE> for the landing of the troops.
 They passed and landed without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks.
 The islands of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> and the maritime towns were subdued by the arms or the name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> (I use the modern appellation) to the siege of Durazzo.
 That city, the western key of the empire, was guarded by ancient renown, and recent fortifications, by <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, a patrician, victorious in the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> wars, and a numerous garrison of <NORP>Albanians</NORP> and Macedonians, who, in every age, have maintained the character of soldiers.
 In the prosecution of his enterprise, the courage of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was assailed by every form of danger and mischance.
 In the most propitious season of the year, as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow unexpectedly arose: the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was swelled by the raging blast of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the <NORP>Acroceraunian</NORP> rocks.
 (67) The sails, the masts, and the oars, were shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were covered with the fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged.
 The ducal galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> halted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of his loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had explored the ocean from <LOC>Greenland</LOC> to Mount Atlas, and who smiled at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean.
 They had wept during the tempest; they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians, who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> day's action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, (68) who led the naval powers of his father.
 All night the galleys of the republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions, the station of their archers, the weight of their javelins, and the borrowed aid of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire.
 The <NORP>Apulian</NORP> and <NORP>Ragusian</NORP> vessels fled to the shore, several were cut from their cables, and dragged away by the conqueror; and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke.
 A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo, and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and provision.
 That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease; <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred knights perished by an inglorious death; and the list of burials (if all could obtain a decent burial) amounted to <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand persons.
 Under these calamities, the mind of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> alone was firm and invincible; and while he collected new forces from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Sicily, he battered, or scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo.
 But his industry and valour were encountered by equal valour and more perfect industry.
 A movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers, had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart: but the descent of the door or drawbridge was checked by an enormous beam, and the wooden structure was constantly consumed by artificial flames.
 The army and the march of the emperor Alexius, April-September.
 While the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was attacked by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in the East, east, and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the West, the aged successor of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the founder of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasty.
 The princess Anne, his daughter and historian, observes, in her affected style, that even <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> was unequal to a double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a hasty peace with the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo.
 On his accession, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> found the camp without soldiers, and the treasury without money; yet such were the vigour and activity of his measures, that in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months he assembled an army of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand men, (69) and performed a march of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 His troops were levied in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, from <LOC>Peloponnesus</LOC> to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse-guards; and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes, some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed with the purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of affluence and dignity.
 Their youthful ardour might animate the multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their importunate clamours for speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded and starved the besieging army.
 The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world: the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the garrisons of Anatolia, or <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, had been purchased by the evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks.
 The strength of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> army consisted in the Varangians, the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule.
 Under the yoke of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conqueror, the <NORP>Danes</NORP> and <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> were oppressed and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long pilgrimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and revenge.
 They were entertained in the service of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> station was in a new city on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore: but <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valour.
 (70) The name of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in <LOC>Epirus</LOC> the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings.
 The <NORP>Varangians</NORP> were supported by some companies of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> or Latins; and the rebels, who had fled to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> from the tyranny of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their revenge.
 In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the impure aid of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> or <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valour.
 (71) The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> horse were opposed to the lances of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry.
 On the report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> assembled a council of his principal officers.
 "You behold," said he, "your danger: it is urgent and inevitable.
 The hills are covered with arms and standards; and the emperor of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> is accustomed to wars and triumphs.
 Obedience and union are our only safety; and I am ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader.
" The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke thus continued: "Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and deprive cowardice of the means of escape.
 Let us burn our vessels and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the place of our nativity and our burial.
" The resolution was unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his lines, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of the enemy.
 His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious, perhaps, that on the same ground <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had formerly disputed the empire of the world.
 (72) Battle of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, <DATE>October</DATE> 18.
 Against the advice of his wisest captains, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> resolved to risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town.
 He marched in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns to surprise the <NORP>Normans</NORP> before daybreak on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the archers formed the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line; and the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> claimed the honours of the vanguard.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 The <NORP>Lombards</NORP> and <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the garrison, and the coast was lined with the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys, who played their engines among the disorderly throng.
 On the verge of ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.
 Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as a warlike Amazon, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> goddess: (73) though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops.
 (74) Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: "Whither," he cried aloud, "whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and death is less grievous than servitude.
" The moment was decisive: as the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry.
 (75) <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune.
 The princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance, which had shivered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> helmet.
 His desperate valour broke through a squadron of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who opposed his flight; and after wandering <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus.
 The victorious <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp, and the glory of defeating an army <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times more numerous than his own.
 A multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> had been the victims of their own fears; but only <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> of his knights were slain in this memorable day.
 In the <NORP>Roman</NORP> host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and English, amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand: (76) the plain of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was more honorable than his life.
 <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> taken, A.
D.
 1082, February 8.
 It is more than probable that <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks.
 After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo; and a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> commander supplied the place of <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
 The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy.
 (77) Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage.
 At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the walls; the light <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ascended in silence; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror.
 Yet they defended the streets <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days against an enemy already master of the rampart; and near <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months elapsed between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> investment and the final surrender of the place.
 From Durazzo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke advanced into the heart of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> or Albania; traversed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mountains of Thessaly; surprised <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> tremble.
 A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs.
 By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> king of Germany.
 Return of Robert, and the actions of Bohemond.
 Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> counts, exhorting <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the authority of their leader.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of his father; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> destroyers are compared, by the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former.
 (78) After winning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, (79) which contained the treasure and magazines of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp.
 Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times.
 In the poverty of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the desertion of the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers were exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been taught by experience, that the formidable cavalry of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of motion; (80) his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Larissa</GPE> the events of war were protracted and balanced.
 The courage of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was always conspicuous, and often successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the advantage, rather than the honour, of victory.
 After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> III invited by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1081.
 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.
 (84) But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people adhered to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; Besieges Rome, A.
D.
 1081-1084.
 and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany.
 In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war.
 The gates, the bridges, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> hostages, were delivered into his hands: A.
D.
 1081-1084, March 21.
 the anti-pope, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: March 24.
 the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; March 31.
 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.
D.
 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.

 The revolution of human affairs had produced in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> a melancholy contrast between the age of <PERSON>Pythagoras</PERSON> and the tenth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aera.
 At the former period, the coast of Great <GPE>Greece</GPE> (as it was then styled) was planted with free and opulent cities: these cities were peopled with soldiers, artists, and philosophers; and the military strength of Tarentum; Sybaris, or Crotona, was not inferior to that of a powerful kingdom.
 At the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> aera, these once flourishing provinces were clouded with ignorance impoverished by tyranny, and depopulated by <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> war nor can we severely accuse the exaggeration of a contemporary, that a fair and ample district was reduced to the same desolation which had covered the earth after the general deluge.
 (9) Among the hostilities of the Arabs, the Franks, and the Greeks, in the southern Italy, I shall select <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> anecdotes expressive of their national manners.

 It was the amusement of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> to profane, as well as to pillage, the monasteries and churches.
 At the siege of Salerno, a <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> chief spread his couch on the communion-table, and on that altar sacrificed each night the virginity of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> nun.
 As he wrestled with a reluctant maid, a beam in the roof was accidentally or dexterously thrown down on his head; and the death of the lustful emir was imputed to the wrath of Christ, which was at length awakened to the defence of his faithful spouse.

 The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> besieged the cities of <GPE>Beneventum</GPE> and Capua: after a vain appeal to the successors of Charlemagne, the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> implored the clemency and aid of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (11) A fearless citizen dropped from the walls, passed the entrenchments, accomplished his commission, and fell into the hands of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> as he was returning with the welcome news.
 They commanded him to assist their enterprise, and deceive his countrymen, with the assurance that wealth and honours should be the reward of his falsehood, and that his sincerity would be punished with immediate death.
 He affected to yield, but as soon as he was conducted within hearing of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> on the rampart, The rage of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> confirmed his evidence; and the self-devoted patriot was transpierced with a hundred spears.
 He deserves to live in the memory of the virtuous, but the repetition of the same story in ancient and modern times, may sprinkle some doubts on the reality of this generous deed.

 The recital of a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> incident may provoke a smile amidst the horrors of war.
 Theobald, marquis of <GPE>Camerino</GPE> and Spoleto, (13) supported the rebels of Beneventum; and his wanton cruelty was not incompatible in that age with the character of a hero.
 His captives of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> nation or party were castrated without mercy, and the outrage was aggravated by a cruel jest, that he wished to present the emperor with a supply of eunuchs, the most precious ornaments of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The garrison of a castle had been defeated in a sally, and the prisoners were sentenced to the customary operation.
 But the sacrifice was disturbed by the intrusion of a frantic female, who, with bleeding cheeks dishevelled hair, and importunate clamours, compelled the marquis to listen to her complaint.
 <PERSON>Theobald</PERSON> denied the charge, and protested that, since the Amazons, he had never heard of a female war.
 A general laugh applauded her eloquence; the savage Franks, inaccessible to pity, were moved by her ridiculous, yet rational despair; and with the deliverance of the captives, she obtained the restitution of her effects.
 As she returned in triumph to the castle, she was overtaken by a messenger, to inquire, in the name of Theobald, what punishment should be inflicted on her husband, were he again taken in arms.
 Origin of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in Italy, A.
D.
 1016.
 The establishment of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the kingdoms of <GPE>Naples</GPE> and <GPE>Sicily</GPE> (15) is an event most romantic in its origin, and in its consequences most important both to <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The broken provinces of the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, were exposed to every invader, and every sea and land were invaded by the adventurous spirit of the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> pirates.
 After a long indulgence of rapine and slaughter, a fair and ample territory was accepted, occupied, and named, by the <NORP>Normans</NORP> of France: they renounced their gods for the God of the Christians; (16) and the dukes of <GPE>Normandy</GPE> acknowledged themselves the vassals of the successors of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> and Capet.
 The savage fierceness which they had brought from the snowy mountains of <GPE>Norway</GPE> was refined, without being corrupted, in a warmer climate; the companions of <PERSON>Rollo</PERSON> insensibly mingled with the natives; they imbibed the manners, language, (17) and gallantry, of the <NORP>French</NORP> nation; and in a martial age, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> might claim the palm of valour and glorious achievements.
 Of the fashionable superstitions, they embraced with ardour the pilgrimages of Rome, Italy, and the Holy Land.
 In this active devotion, the minds and bodies were invigorated by exercise: danger was the incentive, novelty the recompense; and the prospect of the world was decorated by wonder, credulity, and ambitious hope.
 They confederated for their mutual defence; and the robbers of the Alps, who had been allured by the garb of a pilgrim, were often chastised by the arm of a warrior.
 In <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these pious visits to the cavern of Mount Garganus in Apulia, which had been sanctified by the apparition of the archangel Michael, (18) they were accosted by a stranger in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> habit, but who soon revealed himself as a rebel, a fugitive, and a mortal foe of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire.
 His name was Melo; a noble citizen of Bari, who, after an unsuccessful revolt, was compelled to seek new allies and avengers of his country.
 The bold appearance of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> revived his hopes and solicited his confidence: they listened to the complaints, and still more to the promises, of the patriot.
 The assurance of wealth demonstrated the justice of his cause; and they viewed, as the inheritance of the brave, the fruitful land which was oppressed by effeminate tyrants.
 On their return to Normandy, they kindled a spark of enterprise, and a small but intrepid band was freely associated for the deliverance of Apulia.
 They passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> by separate roads, and in the disguise of pilgrims; but in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Rome</GPE> they were saluted by the chief of Bari, who supplied the more indigent with arms and horses, and instantly led them to the field of action.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conflict, their valour prevailed; but in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> engagement they were overwhelmed by the numbers and military engines of the Greeks, and indignantly retreated with their faces to .
 the enemy.
 The unfortunate <PERSON>Melo</PERSON> ended his life a suppliant at the court of Germany: his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> followers, excluded from their native and their promised land, wandered among the hills and valleys of Italy, and earned their daily subsistence by the sword.
 To that formidable sword the princes of Capua, Beneventum, Salerno, and Naples, alternately appealed in their domestic quarrels; the superior spirit and discipline of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> gave victory to the side which they espoused; and their cautious policy observed the balance of power, lest the preponderance of any rival state should render their aid less important, and their service less profitable.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> asylum was a strong camp in the depth of the marshes of Campania: but they were soon endowed by the liberality of the duke of <GPE>Naples</GPE> with a more plentiful and permanent seat.
 Foundation of Aversa, A.
D.
 1029.
 Eight miles from his residence, as a bulwark against Capua, the town of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> was built and fortified for their use; and they enjoyed as their own the corn and fruits, the meadows and groves, of that fertile district.
 The report of their success attracted every year new swarms of pilgrims and soldiers: the poor were urged by necessity; the rich were excited by hope; and the brave and active spirits of <GPE>Normandy</GPE> were impatient of ease and ambitious of renown.
 The independent standard of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> afforded shelter and encouragement to the outlaws of the province, to every fugitive who had escaped from the injustice or justice of his superiors; and these foreign associates were quickly assimilated in manners and language to the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> colony.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> leader of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> was Count Rainulf; and, in the origin of society, pre-eminence of rank is the reward and the proof of superior merit.
 (19) The <NORP>Normans</NORP> serve in Sicily, A.
D.
 1038.
 Since the conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the Arabs, the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> emperors had been anxious to regain that valuable possession; but their efforts, however strenuous, had been opposed by the distance and the sea.
 Their costly armaments, after a gleam of success, added new pages of calamity and disgrace to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> annals: <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand of their best troops were lost in a single expedition; and the victorious <NORP>Moslems</NORP> derided the policy of a nation which entrusted eunuchs not only with the custody of their women, but with the command of their men (20) After a reign of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred years, the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were ruined by their divisions.
 (21) The emir disclaimed the authority of the king of Tunis; the people rose against the emir; the cities were usurped by the chiefs; each meaner rebel was independent in his village or castle; and the weaker of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rival brothers implored the friendship of the Christians.
 In every service of danger the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were prompt and useful; and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred knights, or warriors on horseback, were enrolled by Arduin, the agent and interpreter of the Greeks, under the standard of Maniaces, governor of Lombardy.
 Before their landing, the brothers were reconciled; the union of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> was restored; and the island was guarded to the water's edge.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> led the van and the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of <GPE>Messina</GPE> felt the valour of an untried foe.
 In a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> action the emir of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> was unhorsed and transpierced by the iron arm of <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Hauteville.
 In a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> engagement, his intrepid companions discomfited the host of sixty thousand Saracens, and left the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> no more than the labor of the pursuit: a splendid victory; but of which the pen of the historian may divide the merit with the lance of the Normans.
 It is, however, true, that they essentially promoted the success of Maniaces, who reduced <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> cities, and the greater part of Sicily, under the obedience of the emperor.
 But his military fame was sullied by ingratitude and tyranny.
 In the division of the spoils, the deserts of his brave auxiliaries were forgotten; and neither their avarice nor their pride could brook this injurious treatment.
 They complained by the mouth of their interpreter: their complaint was disregarded; their interpreter was scourged; the sufferings were his; the insult and resentment belonged to those whose sentiments he had delivered.
 Yet they dissembled till they had obtained, or stolen, a safe passage to the <NORP>Italian</NORP> continent: their brethren of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> sympathized in their indignation, and the province of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invaded as the forfeit of the debt.
 (22) Their conquest of Apulia, A.
D.
 1040-1043.
 Above <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> after the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emigration, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> took the field with no more than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred horse and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred foot; and after the recall of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> legions (23) from the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> war, their numbers are magnified to the amount of threescore thousand men.
 Their herald proposed the option of battle or retreat; "of battle," was the unanimous cry of the Normans; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their stoutest warriors, with a stroke of his fist, felled to the ground the horse of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> messenger.
 He was dismissed with a fresh horse; the insult was concealed from the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops; but in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> successive battles they were more fatally instructed of the prowess of their adversaries.
 In the plains of Cannae, the <NORP>Asiatics</NORP> fled before the adventurers of France; the duke of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> was made prisoner; the <NORP>Apulians</NORP> acquiesced in a new dominion; and the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> places of Bari, Otranto, Brundusium, and Tarentum, were alone saved in the shipwreck of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> fortunes.
 From this aera we may date the establishment of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> power, which soon eclipsed the infant colony of Aversa.
 <CARDINAL>Twelve</CARDINAL> counts (24) were chosen by the popular suffrage; and age, birth, and merit, were the motives of their choice.
 The tributes of their peculiar districts were appropriated to their use; and each count erected a fortress in the midst of his lands, and at the head of his vassals.
 In the centre of the province, the common habitation of <ORG>Melphi</ORG> was reserved as the metropolis and citadel of the republic; a house and separate <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> was allotted to each of the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> counts: and the national concerns were regulated by this military senate.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of his peers, their president and general, was entitled count of Apulia; and this dignity was conferred on <PERSON>William</PERSON> of the iron arm, who, in the language of the age, is styled a lion in battle, a lamb in society, and an angel in council.
 (25) Character of the Normans.
 The manners of his countrymen are fairly delineated by a contemporary and national historian.
 (26) "The Normans," says Malaterra, "are a cunning and revengeful people; eloquence and dissimulation appear to be their hereditary qualities: they can stoop to flatter; but unless they are curbed by the restraint of law, they indulge the licentiousness of nature and passion.
 Their princes affect the praises of popular munificence; the people observe the medium, or rather blend the extremes, of avarice and prodigality; and in their eager thirst of wealth and dominion, they despise whatever they possess, and hope whatever they desire.
 Arms and horses, the luxury of dress, the exercises of hunting and hawking (27) are the delight of the Normans; but, on pressing occasions, they can endure with incredible patience the inclemency of every climate, and the toil and absence of a military life.
" (28) Oppression of Apulia,A.
D.
 1046 etc.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> were seated on the verge of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires; and, according to the policy of the hour, they accepted the investiture of their lands, from the sovereigns of <GPE>Germany</GPE> or Constantinople.
 But the firmest title of these adventurers was the right of conquest: they neither loved nor trusted; they were neither trusted nor beloved: the contempt of the princes was mixed with fear, and the fear of the natives was mingled with hatred and resentment.
 Every object of desire, a horse, a woman, a garden, tempted and gratified the rapaciousness of the strangers; (29) and the avarice of their chiefs was only colored by the more specious names of ambition and glory.
 The <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> counts were sometimes joined in the league of injustice: in their domestic quarrels they disputed the spoils of the people: the virtues of <PERSON>William</PERSON> were buried in his grave; and Drogo, his brother and successor, was better qualified to lead the valour, than to restrain the violence, of his peers.
 Under the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> Monomachus, the policy, rather than benevolence, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court, attempted to relieve <GPE>Italy</GPE> from this adherent mischief, more grievous than a flight of Barbarians; (30) and Argyrus, the son of Melo, was invested for this purpose with the most lofty titles (31) and the most ample commission.
 The memory of his father might recommend him to the Normans; and he had already engaged their voluntary service to quell the revolt of Maniaces, and to avenge their own and the public injury.
 It was the design of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to transplant the warlike colony from the <NORP>Italian</NORP> provinces to the Persian war; and the son of <PERSON>Melo</PERSON> distributed among the chiefs the gold and manufactures of Greece, as the first-fruits of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> bounty.
 But his arts were baffled by the sense and spirit of the conquerors of Apulia: his gifts, or at least his proposals, were rejected; and they unanimously refused to relinquish their possessions and their hopes for the distant prospect of <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> fortune.
 League of the Pope and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, A.
D.
 1049-1054.
 After the means of persuasion had failed, <PERSON>Argyrus</PERSON> resolved to compel or to destroy: the <NORP>Latin</NORP> powers were solicited against the common enemy; and an offensive alliance was formed of the pope and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West.
 The throne of St.
 Peter was occupied by <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, a simple saint, (32) of a temper most apt to deceive himself and the world, and whose venerable character would consecrate with the name of piety the measures least compatible with the practice of religion.
 His humanity was affected by the complaints, perhaps the calumnies, of an injured people: the impious <NORP>Normans</NORP> had interrupted the payment of tithes; and the temporal sword might be lawfully unsheathed against the sacrilegious robbers, who were deaf to the censures of the church.
 As a <NORP>German</NORP> of noble birth and royal kindred, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> had free access to the court and confidence of the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Third; and in search of arms and allies, his ardent zeal transported him from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> to Saxony, from the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> to the Tyber.
 During these hostile preparations, <PERSON>Argyrus</PERSON> indulged himself in the use of secret and guilty weapons: a crowd of <NORP>Normans</NORP> became the victims of public or private revenge; A.
D.
 1051and the valiant <PERSON>Drogo</PERSON> was murdered in a church.
 But his spirit survived in his brother Humphrey, the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> count of Apulia.
 The assassins were chastised; and the son of Melo, overthrown and wounded, was driven from the field, to hide his shame behind the walls of Bari, and to await the tardy succour of his allies.
 Expedition of pope <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> IX.
 Against the Normans, A.
D.
 1053.
 But the power of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was distracted by a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> war; the mind of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was feeble and irresolute; and the pope, instead of repassing the <LOC>Alps</LOC> with a <NORP>German</NORP> army, was accompanied only by a guard of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Swabians</NORP> and some volunteers of Lorraine.
 In his long progress from <GPE>Mantua</GPE> to Beneventum, a vile and promiscuous multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> was enlisted under the holy standard: (33) the priest and the robber slept in the same tent; the pikes and crosses were intermingled in the front; and the martial saint repeated the lessons of his youth in the order of march, of encampment, and of combat.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> could muster in the field no more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand horse, with a handful of infantry: the defection of the natives intercepted their provisions and retreat; and their spirit, incapable of fear, was chilled for a moment by superstitious awe.
 On the hostile approach of Leo, they knelt without disgrace or reluctance before their spiritual father.
 But the pope was inexorable; his lofty <NORP>Germans</NORP> affected to deride the diminutive stature of their adversaries; and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were informed that death or exile was their only alternative.
 Flight they disdained, and, as many of them had been <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days without tasting food, they embraced the assurance of a more easy and honourable death.
 They climbed the hill of Civitella, descended into the plain, and charged in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> divisions the army of the pope.
 His defeat and captivity, June 18.
 On the left, and in the centre, <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> count of Aversa, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> the famous Guiscard, attacked, broke, routed, and pursued the <NORP>Italian</NORP> multitudes, who fought without discipline, and fled without shame.
 A harder trial was reserved for the valour of Count Humphrey, who led the cavalry of the right wing.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> (34) have been described as unskillful in the management of the horse and the lance, but on foot they formed a strong and impenetrable phalanx; and neither man, nor steed, nor armour, could resist the weight of their long and two-handed swords.
 After a severe conflict, they were encompassed by the squadrons returning from the pursuit; and died in the ranks with the esteem of their foes, and the satisfaction of revenge.
 The gates of <PERSON>Civitella</PERSON> were shut against the flying pope, and he was overtaken by the pious conquerors, who kissed his feet, to implore his blessing and the absolution of their sinful victory.
 The soldiers beheld in their enemy and captive the vicar of Christ; and, though we may suppose the policy of the chiefs, it is probable that they were infected by the popular superstition.
 In the calm of retirement, the well-meaning pope deplored the effusion of <NORP>Christian</NORP> blood, which must be imputed to his account: he felt, that he had been the author of sin and scandal; and as his undertaking had failed, the indecency of his military character was universally condemned.
 (35) With these dispositions, he listened to the offers of a beneficial treaty; deserted an alliance which he had preached as the cause of God; and ratified the past and future conquests of the Normans.
 Origin of the papal investitures to the Normans.
 By whatever hands they had been usurped, the provinces of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were a part of the donation of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and the patrimony of St.
 Peter: the grant and the acceptance confirmed the mutual claims of the pontiff and the adventurers.
 They promised to support each other with spiritual and temporal arms; a tribute or quitrent of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> pence was afterwards stipulated for every ploughland; and since this memorable transaction, the kingdom of <GPE>Naples</GPE> has remained above <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred <DATE>years</DATE> a fief of the Holy See.
 (36) Birth and character of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, A.
D.
 1020-1085.
 The pedigree of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> (37) is variously deduced from the peasants and the dukes of Normandy: from the peasants, by the pride and ignorance of a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> princess; (38) from the dukes, by the ignorance and flattery of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> subjects.
 (39) His genuine descent may be ascribed to the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> or middle order of private nobility.
 (40) He sprang from a race of valvassors or bannerets, of the diocese of Coutances, in the Lower Normandy: the castle of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was their honourable seat: his father <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> was conspicuous in the court and army of the duke; and his military service was furnished by <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> soldiers or knights.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> marriages, of a rank not unworthy of his own, made him the father of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> sons, who were educated at home by the impartial tenderness of his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife.
 But a narrow patrimony was insufficient for this numerous and daring progeny; they saw around the neighbourhood the mischiefs of poverty and discord, and resolved to seek in foreign wars a more glorious inheritance.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> only remained to perpetuate the race, and cherish their father's age: their <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> brothers, as they successfully attained the vigour of manhood, departed from the castle, passed the Alps, and joined the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> camp of the Normans.
 The elder were prompted by native spirit; their success encouraged their younger brethren, and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> in seniority, William, Drogo, and Humphrey, deserved to be the chiefs of their nation and the founders of the new republic.
 <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was the eldest of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> sons of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> marriage; and even the reluctant praise of his foes has endowed him with the heroic qualities of a soldier and a statesman.
 His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army: his limbs were cast in the true proportion of strength and gracefulness; and to the decline of life, he maintained the patient vigour of health and the commanding dignity of his form.
 His complexion was ruddy, his shoulders were broad, his hair and beard were long and of a flaxen colour, his eyes sparkled with fire, and his voice, like that of Achilles, could impress obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle.
 In the ruder ages of chivalry, such qualifications are not below the notice of the poet or historians: they may observe that Robert, at once, and with equal dexterity, could wield in the right hand his sword, his lance in the left; that in the battle of <PERSON>Civitella</PERSON> he was thrice unhorsed; and that in the close of that memorable day he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valour from the warriors of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies.
 (41) His boundless ambition was founded on the consciousness of superior worth: in the pursuit of greatness, he was never arrested by the scruples of justice, and seldom moved by the feelings of humanity: though not insensible of fame, the choice of open or clandestine means was determined only by his present advantage.
 The surname of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> (42) was applied to this master of political wisdom, which is too often confounded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is praised by the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> poet for excelling the cunning of <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> and the eloquence of Cicero.
 Yet these arts were disguised by an appearance of military frankness: in his highest fortune, he was accessible and courteous to his fellow-soldiers; and while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects, he affected in his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion of his country.
 He grasped with a rapacious, that he might distribute with a liberal, hand: his primitive indigence had taught the habits of frugality; the gain of a merchant was not below his attention; and his prisoners were tortured with slow and unfeeling cruelty, to force a discovery of their secret treasure.
 According to the Greeks, he departed from <GPE>Normandy</GPE> with only <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> followers on horseback and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> on foot; yet even this allowance appears too bountiful: the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> as a pilgrim; and his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> military band was levied among the adventurers of Italy.
 His brothers and countrymen had divided the fertile lands of Apulia; but they guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice; the aspiring youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria, and in his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploits against the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the natives, it is not easy to discriminate the hero from the robber.
 To surprise a castle or a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to plunder the adjacent villages for necessary food, were the obscure labours which formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body.
 The volunteers of <GPE>Normandy</GPE> adhered to his standard; and, under his command, the peasants of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> assumed the name and character of Normans.
 His ambition and success, A.
D.
 1054-1080.
 As the genius of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> expanded with his fortune, he awakened the jealousy of his elder brother, by whom, in a transient quarrel, his life was threatened and his liberty restrained.
 After the death of Humphrey, the tender age of his sons excluded them from the command; they were reduced to a private estate, by the ambition of their guardian and uncle; and <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was exalted on a buckler, and saluted count of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and general of the republic.
 With an increase of authority and of force, he resumed the conquest of Calabria, and soon aspired to a rank that should raise him forever above the heads of his equals.
 By some acts of rapine or sacrilege, he had incurred a papal excommunication; but <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> was easily persuaded that the divisions of friends could terminate only in their mutual prejudice; that the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were the faithful champions of the Holy See; and it was safer to trust the alliance of a prince than the caprice of an aristocracy.
 A synod of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred bishops was convened at Melphi; and the count interrupted an important enterprise to guard the person and execute the decrees of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 His gratitude and policy conferred on <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and his posterity the ducal title, (43) with the investiture of Apulia, Calabria, and all the lands, both in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, which his sword could rescue from the schismatic <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the unbelieving Saracens.
 (44) This apostolic sanction might justify his arms; but the obedience of a free and victorious people could not be transferred without their consent; and <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> dissembled his elevation till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by the conquest of <PERSON>Consenza</PERSON> and Reggio.
 In the hour of triumph, he assembled his troops, and solicited the <NORP>Normans</NORP> to confirm by their suffrage the judgment of the vicar of Christ: Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1060.
 the soldiers hailed with joyful acclamations their valiant duke; and the counts, his former equals, pronounced the oath of fidelity with hollow smiles and secret indignation.
 After this inauguration, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> styled himself, "By the grace of God and St.
 Peter, duke of Apulia, Calabria, and hereafter of Sicily;" and it was the labour of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> to deserve and realize these lofty appellations.
 Such tardy progress, in a narrow space, may seem unworthy of the abilities of the chief and the spirit of the nation; but the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were few in number; their resources were scanty; their service was voluntary and precarious.
 The bravest designs of the duke were sometimes opposed by the free voice of his parliament of barons: the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> counts of popular election conspired against his authority; and against their perfidious uncle, the sons of <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> demanded justice and revenge.
 By his policy and vigour, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> discovered their plots, suppressed their rebellions, and punished the guilty with death or exile: but in these domestic feuds, his years, and the national strength, were unprofitably consumed.
 After the defeat of his foreign enemies, the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, their broken forces retreated to the strong and populous cities of the sea-coast.
 They excelled in the arts of fortification and defence; the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were accustomed to serve on horseback in the field, and their rude attempts could only succeed by the efforts of persevering courage.
 The resistance of <GPE>Salerno</GPE> was maintained above eight months; the siege or blockade of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> lasted near <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years.
 In these actions the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke was the foremost in every danger; in every fatigue the last and most patient.
 As he pressed the citadel of Salerno, a huge stone from the rampart shattered <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his military engines; and by a splinter he was wounded in the breast.
 Before the gates of Bari, he lodged in a miserable hut or barrack, composed of dry branches, and thatched with straw; a perilous station, on all sides open to the inclemency of the <DATE>winter</DATE> and the spears of the enemy.
 (45) His <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> correspond with the limits of the present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his arms have not been dissevered by the revolutions of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred years.
 (46) The monarchy has been composed of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> provinces of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> and Apulia, of the <GPE>Lombard</GPE> principality of Salerno, the republic of Amalphi, and the inland dependencies of the large and ancient duchy of Beneventum.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> districts only were exempted from the common law of subjection; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> forever, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> last till the middle of the succeeding century.
 The city and immediate territory of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> had been transferred, by gift or exchange, from the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; and although this holy land was sometimes invaded, the name of St.
 Peter was finally more potent than the sword of the Normans.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> colony of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> subdued and held the state of Capua; and her princes were reduced to beg their bread before the palace of their fathers.
 The dukes of Naples, the present metropolis, maintained the popular freedom, under the shadow of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 Among the new acquisitions of Guiscard, the science of Salerno, (47) and the trade of Amalphi, (48) may detain for a moment the curiosity of the reader.
 School of Salerno.
 I.
 Of the learned faculties, jurisprudence implies the previous establishment of laws and property; and theology may perhaps be superseded by the full light of religion and reason.
 But the savage and the sage must alike implore the assistance of physic; and, if our diseases are inflamed by luxury, the mischiefs of blows and wounds would be more frequent in the ruder ages of society.
 The treasures of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> medicine had been communicated to the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> colonies of Africa, Spain, and Sicily; and in the intercourse of peace and war, a spark of knowledge had been kindled and cherished at Salerno, an illustrious city, in which the men were honest and the women beautiful.
 (49) A school, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> that arose in the darkness of Europe, was consecrated to the healing art: the conscience of monks and bishops was reconciled to that salutary and lucrative profession; and a crowd of patients, of the most eminent rank, and most distant climates, invited or visited the physicians of Salerno.
 They were protected by the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquerors; and Guiscard, though bred in arms, could discern the merit and value of a philosopher.
 After a pilgrimage of thirty-nine years, Constantine, an <NORP>African</NORP> Christian, returned from Bagdad, a master of the language and learning of the Arabians; and <GPE>Salerno</GPE> was enriched by the practice, the lessons, and the writings of the pupil of Avicenna.
 The school of medicine has long slept in the name of a university; but her precepts are abridged in a string of aphorisms, bound together in the <NORP>Leonine</NORP> verses, or <NORP>Latin</NORP> rhymes, of the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> century.
 (50) Trade of Amalphi.
 II.
 Seven miles to the west of Salerno, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> to the south of Naples, the obscure town of <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> displayed the power and rewards of industry.
 The land, however fertile, was of narrow extent; but the sea was accessible and open: the inhabitants <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assumed the office of supplying the western world with the manufactures and productions of the East; and this useful traffic was the source of their opulence and freedom.
 The government was popular, under the administration of a duke and the supremacy of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 Fifty thousand citizens were numbered in the walls of Amalphi; nor was any city more abundantly provided with gold, silver, and the objects of precious luxury.
 The mariners who swarmed in her port, excelled in the theory and practice of navigation and astronomy: and the discovery of the compass, which has opened the globe, is owing to their ingenuity or good fortune.
 Their trade was extended to the coasts, or at least to the commodities, of Africa, Arabia, and India: and their settlements in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, acquired the privileges of independent colonies.
 (51) After <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <DATE>years</DATE> of prosperity, <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> was oppressed by the arms of the Normans, and sacked by the jealousy of Pisa; but the poverty of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand fisherman is yet dignified by the remains of an arsenal, a cathedral, and the palaces of royal merchants.
 Conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by count Roger, A.
D.
 1060-1090.
 Roger, the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> and last of the sons of Tancred, had been long detained in <GPE>Normandy</GPE> by his own and his father' age.
 He accepted the welcome summons; hastened to the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> camp; and deserved at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> the esteem, and afterwards the envy, of his elder brother.
 Their valour and ambition were equal; but the youth, the beauty, the elegant manners, of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> engaged the disinterested love of the soldiers and people.
 So scanty was his allowance for himself and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> followers, that he descended from conquest to robbery, and from robbery to domestic theft; and so loose were the notions of property, that, by his own historian, at his special command, he is accused of stealing horses from a stable at Melphi.
 (52) His spirit emerged from poverty and disgrace: from these base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy war; and the invasion of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was seconded by the zeal and policy of his brother Guiscard.
 After the retreat of the Greeks, the idolaters, a most audacious reproach of the Catholics, had retrieved their losses and possessions; but the deliverance of the island, so vainly undertaken by the forces of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, was achieved by a small and private band of adventurers.
 (53) In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attempt, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> braved, in an open boat, the real and fabulous dangers of <PRODUCT>Scylla</PRODUCT> and Charybdis; landed with only sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; drove the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> to the gates of <GPE>Messina</GPE> and safely returned with the spoils of the adjacent country.
 In the fortress of Trani, his active and patient courage were equally conspicuous.
 In his old age he related with pleasure, that, by the distress of the siege, himself, and the countess his wife, had been reduced to a single cloak or mantle, which they wore alternately; that in a sally his horse had been slain, and he was dragged away by the Saracens; but that he owed his rescue to his good sword, and had retreated with his saddle on his back, lest the meanest trophy might be left in the hands of the miscreants.
 In the siege of Trani, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Normans</NORP> withstood and repulsed the forces of the island.
 In the field of Ceramio, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand horse and foot were overthrown by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> soldiers, without reckoning St.
 George, who fought on horseback in the foremost ranks.
 The captive banners, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> camels, were reserved for the successor of St.
 Peter; and had these barbaric spoils been exposed, not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol, they might have revived the memory of the <NORP>Punic</NORP> triumphs.
 These insufficient numbers of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> most probably denote their knights, the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank, each of whom was attended by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> followers in the field; (54) yet, with the aid of this interpretation, and after every fair allowance on the side of valour, arms, and reputation, the discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce the prudent reader to the alternative of a miracle or a fable.
 The <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> derived a frequent and powerful succour from their countrymen of Africa: in the siege of Palermo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry was assisted by the galleys of Pisa; and, in the hour of action, the envy of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers was sublimed to a generous and invincible emulation.
 After a war of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, (55) Roger, with the title of great count, obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most fruitful island of the Mediterranean; and his administration displays a liberal and enlightened mind, above the limits of his age and education.
 The <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were maintained in the free enjoyment of their religion and property: (56) a philosopher and physician of Mazara, of the race of Mahomet, harangued the conqueror, and was invited to court; his geography of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> climates was translated into Latin; and Roger, after a diligent perusal, preferred the work of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> to the writings of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> Ptolemy.
 (57) A remnant of <NORP>Christian</NORP> natives had promoted the success of the Normans: they were rewarded by the triumph of the cross.
 The island was restored to the jurisdiction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; new bishops were planted in the principal cities; and the clergy was satisfied by a liberal endowment of churches and monasteries.
 Yet the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> hero asserted the rights of the civil magistrate.
 Instead of resigning the investiture of benefices, he dexterously applied to his own profit the papal claims: the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged, by the singular bull, which declares the princes of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> hereditary and perpetual legates of the Holy See.
 (58) <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> invades the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1081.
 To <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was more glorious than beneficial: the possession of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> was inadequate to his ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> occasion of invading, perhaps of subduing, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire of the East.
 (59) From his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife, the partner of his humble fortune, he had been divorced under the pretence of consanguinity; and her son <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was destined to imitate, rather than to succeed, his illustrious father.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger; their <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> daughters were given in honorable nuptials, (60) and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of them was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a beautiful youth, the son and heir of the emperor Michael.
 (61) But the throne of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was shaken by a revolution: the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> family of <PERSON>Ducas</PERSON> was confined to the palace or the cloister; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> deplored, and resented, the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally.
 A Greek, who styled himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared at Salerno, and related the adventures of his fall and flight.
 That unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the pomp and titles of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity: in his triumphal progress through <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> (62) was saluted with the tears and acclamations of the people; and Pope <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> exhorted the bishops to preach, and the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> to fight, in the pious work of his restoration.
 His conversations with <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> were frequent and familiar; and their mutual promises were justified by the valour of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and the treasures of the East.
 Yet this Michael, by the confession of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, was a pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled from his convent, or a domestic who had served in the palace.
 The fraud had been contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after this pretender had given a decent colour to his arms, he would sink, at the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity.
 But victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks; and the ardour of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> was much inferior to their credulity: the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> veterans wished to enjoy the harvest of their toils, and the unwarlike <NORP>Italians</NORP> trembled at the known and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition.
 In his new levies, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> exerted the influence of gifts and promises, the terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some acts of violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy were pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting prince.
 After <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years' incessant preparations the land and naval forces were assembled at Otranto, at the heel, or extreme promontory, of Italy; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was accompanied by his wife, who fought by his side, his son Bohemond, and the representative of the emperor Michael.
 Thirteen hundred knights (63) of <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> race or discipline, formed the sinews of the army, which might be swelled to <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand (64) followers of every denomination.
 The men, the horses, the arms, the engines, the wooden towers, covered with raw hides, were embarked on board <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> vessels: the transports had been built in the ports of Italy, and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the republic of Ragusa.
 Siege of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, June 17.
 At the mouth of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf, the shores of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Epirus</LOC> incline towards each other.
 The space between <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> and Durazzo, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> passage, is no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles; (65) at the last station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; (66) and this narrow distance had suggested to <PERSON>Pyrrhus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> the sublime or extravagant idea of a bridge.
 Before the general embarkation, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke despatched <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> with <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> galleys to seize or threaten the Isle of Corfu, to survey the opposite coast, and to secure a harbour in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Vallona</GPE> for the landing of the troops.
 They passed and landed without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks.
 The islands of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> and the maritime towns were subdued by the arms or the name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> (I use the modern appellation) to the siege of Durazzo.
 That city, the western key of the empire, was guarded by ancient renown, and recent fortifications, by <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, a patrician, victorious in the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> wars, and a numerous garrison of <NORP>Albanians</NORP> and Macedonians, who, in every age, have maintained the character of soldiers.
 In the prosecution of his enterprise, the courage of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was assailed by every form of danger and mischance.
 In the most propitious season of the year, as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow unexpectedly arose: the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was swelled by the raging blast of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the <NORP>Acroceraunian</NORP> rocks.
 (67) The sails, the masts, and the oars, were shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were covered with the fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged.
 The ducal galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> halted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of his loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had explored the ocean from <LOC>Greenland</LOC> to Mount Atlas, and who smiled at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean.
 They had wept during the tempest; they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians, who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> day's action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, (68) who led the naval powers of his father.
 All night the galleys of the republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions, the station of their archers, the weight of their javelins, and the borrowed aid of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire.
 The <NORP>Apulian</NORP> and <NORP>Ragusian</NORP> vessels fled to the shore, several were cut from their cables, and dragged away by the conqueror; and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke.
 A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo, and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and provision.
 That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease; <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred knights perished by an inglorious death; and the list of burials (if all could obtain a decent burial) amounted to <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand persons.
 Under these calamities, the mind of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> alone was firm and invincible; and while he collected new forces from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Sicily, he battered, or scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo.
 But his industry and valour were encountered by equal valour and more perfect industry.
 A movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers, had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart: but the descent of the door or drawbridge was checked by an enormous beam, and the wooden structure was constantly consumed by artificial flames.
 The army and the march of the emperor Alexius, April-September.
 While the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was attacked by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in the East, east, and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the West, the aged successor of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the founder of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasty.
 The princess Anne, his daughter and historian, observes, in her affected style, that even <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> was unequal to a double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a hasty peace with the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo.
 On his accession, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> found the camp without soldiers, and the treasury without money; yet such were the vigour and activity of his measures, that in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months he assembled an army of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand men, (69) and performed a march of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 His troops were levied in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, from <LOC>Peloponnesus</LOC> to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse-guards; and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes, some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed with the purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of affluence and dignity.
 Their youthful ardour might animate the multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their importunate clamours for speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded and starved the besieging army.
 The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world: the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the garrisons of Anatolia, or <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, had been purchased by the evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks.
 The strength of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> army consisted in the Varangians, the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule.
 Under the yoke of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conqueror, the <NORP>Danes</NORP> and <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> were oppressed and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long pilgrimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and revenge.
 They were entertained in the service of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> station was in a new city on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore: but <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valour.
 (70) The name of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in <LOC>Epirus</LOC> the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings.
 The <NORP>Varangians</NORP> were supported by some companies of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> or Latins; and the rebels, who had fled to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> from the tyranny of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their revenge.
 In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the impure aid of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> or <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valour.
 (71) The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> horse were opposed to the lances of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry.
 On the report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> assembled a council of his principal officers.
 "You behold," said he, "your danger: it is urgent and inevitable.
 The hills are covered with arms and standards; and the emperor of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> is accustomed to wars and triumphs.
 Obedience and union are our only safety; and I am ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader.
" The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke thus continued: "Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and deprive cowardice of the means of escape.
 Let us burn our vessels and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the place of our nativity and our burial.
" The resolution was unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his lines, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of the enemy.
 His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious, perhaps, that on the same ground <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had formerly disputed the empire of the world.
 (72) Battle of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, <DATE>October</DATE> 18.
 Against the advice of his wisest captains, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> resolved to risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town.
 He marched in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns to surprise the <NORP>Normans</NORP> before daybreak on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the archers formed the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line; and the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> claimed the honours of the vanguard.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 The <NORP>Lombards</NORP> and <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the garrison, and the coast was lined with the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys, who played their engines among the disorderly throng.
 On the verge of ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.
 Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as a warlike Amazon, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> goddess: (73) though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops.
 (74) Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: "Whither," he cried aloud, "whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and death is less grievous than servitude.
" The moment was decisive: as the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry.
 (75) <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune.
 The princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance, which had shivered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> helmet.
 His desperate valour broke through a squadron of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who opposed his flight; and after wandering <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus.
 The victorious <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp, and the glory of defeating an army <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times more numerous than his own.
 A multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> had been the victims of their own fears; but only <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> of his knights were slain in this memorable day.
 In the <NORP>Roman</NORP> host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and English, amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand: (76) the plain of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was more honorable than his life.
 <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> taken, A.
D.
 1082, February 8.
 It is more than probable that <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks.
 After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo; and a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> commander supplied the place of <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
 The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy.
 (77) Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage.
 At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the walls; the light <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ascended in silence; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror.
 Yet they defended the streets <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days against an enemy already master of the rampart; and near <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months elapsed between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> investment and the final surrender of the place.
 From Durazzo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke advanced into the heart of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> or Albania; traversed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mountains of Thessaly; surprised <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> tremble.
 A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs.
 By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> king of Germany.
 Return of Robert, and the actions of Bohemond.
 Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> counts, exhorting <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the authority of their leader.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of his father; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> destroyers are compared, by the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former.
 (78) After winning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, (79) which contained the treasure and magazines of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp.
 Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times.
 In the poverty of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the desertion of the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers were exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been taught by experience, that the formidable cavalry of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of motion; (80) his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Larissa</GPE> the events of war were protracted and balanced.
 The courage of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was always conspicuous, and often successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the advantage, rather than the honour, of victory.
 After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> III invited by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1081.
 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.
 (84) But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people adhered to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; Besieges Rome, A.
D.
 1081-1084.
 and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany.
 In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war.
 The gates, the bridges, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> hostages, were delivered into his hands: A.
D.
 1081-1084, March 21.
 the anti-pope, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: March 24.
 the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; March 31.
 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.
D.
 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.
 <PERSON>William</PERSON> I.
 the Bad king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1154, Feb.
26 -A.
D.
 1166, <DATE>May</DATE> 7.
 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.

 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.

 Since the conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the Arabs, the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> emperors had been anxious to regain that valuable possession; but their efforts, however strenuous, had been opposed by the distance and the sea.
 Their costly armaments, after a gleam of success, added new pages of calamity and disgrace to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> annals: <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand of their best troops were lost in a single expedition; and the victorious <NORP>Moslems</NORP> derided the policy of a nation which entrusted eunuchs not only with the custody of their women, but with the command of their men (20) After a reign of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred years, the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were ruined by their divisions.
 (21) The emir disclaimed the authority of the king of Tunis; the people rose against the emir; the cities were usurped by the chiefs; each meaner rebel was independent in his village or castle; and the weaker of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rival brothers implored the friendship of the Christians.
 In every service of danger the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were prompt and useful; and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred knights, or warriors on horseback, were enrolled by Arduin, the agent and interpreter of the Greeks, under the standard of Maniaces, governor of Lombardy.
 Before their landing, the brothers were reconciled; the union of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> was restored; and the island was guarded to the water's edge.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> led the van and the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of <GPE>Messina</GPE> felt the valour of an untried foe.
 In a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> action the emir of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> was unhorsed and transpierced by the iron arm of <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Hauteville.
 In a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> engagement, his intrepid companions discomfited the host of sixty thousand Saracens, and left the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> no more than the labor of the pursuit: a splendid victory; but of which the pen of the historian may divide the merit with the lance of the Normans.
 It is, however, true, that they essentially promoted the success of Maniaces, who reduced <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> cities, and the greater part of Sicily, under the obedience of the emperor.
 But his military fame was sullied by ingratitude and tyranny.
 In the division of the spoils, the deserts of his brave auxiliaries were forgotten; and neither their avarice nor their pride could brook this injurious treatment.
 They complained by the mouth of their interpreter: their complaint was disregarded; their interpreter was scourged; the sufferings were his; the insult and resentment belonged to those whose sentiments he had delivered.
 Yet they dissembled till they had obtained, or stolen, a safe passage to the <NORP>Italian</NORP> continent: their brethren of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> sympathized in their indignation, and the province of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invaded as the forfeit of the debt.
 (22) Their conquest of Apulia, A.
D.
 1040-1043.
 Above <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> after the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emigration, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> took the field with no more than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred horse and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred foot; and after the recall of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> legions (23) from the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> war, their numbers are magnified to the amount of threescore thousand men.
 Their herald proposed the option of battle or retreat; "of battle," was the unanimous cry of the Normans; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their stoutest warriors, with a stroke of his fist, felled to the ground the horse of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> messenger.
 He was dismissed with a fresh horse; the insult was concealed from the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops; but in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> successive battles they were more fatally instructed of the prowess of their adversaries.
 In the plains of Cannae, the <NORP>Asiatics</NORP> fled before the adventurers of France; the duke of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> was made prisoner; the <NORP>Apulians</NORP> acquiesced in a new dominion; and the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> places of Bari, Otranto, Brundusium, and Tarentum, were alone saved in the shipwreck of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> fortunes.
 From this aera we may date the establishment of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> power, which soon eclipsed the infant colony of Aversa.
 <CARDINAL>Twelve</CARDINAL> counts (24) were chosen by the popular suffrage; and age, birth, and merit, were the motives of their choice.
 The tributes of their peculiar districts were appropriated to their use; and each count erected a fortress in the midst of his lands, and at the head of his vassals.
 In the centre of the province, the common habitation of <ORG>Melphi</ORG> was reserved as the metropolis and citadel of the republic; a house and separate <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> was allotted to each of the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> counts: and the national concerns were regulated by this military senate.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of his peers, their president and general, was entitled count of Apulia; and this dignity was conferred on <PERSON>William</PERSON> of the iron arm, who, in the language of the age, is styled a lion in battle, a lamb in society, and an angel in council.
 (25) Character of the Normans.
 The manners of his countrymen are fairly delineated by a contemporary and national historian.
 (26)Oppression of Apulia,A.
D.
 1046 etc.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> were seated on the verge of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires; and, according to the policy of the hour, they accepted the investiture of their lands, from the sovereigns of <GPE>Germany</GPE> or Constantinople.
 But the firmest title of these adventurers was the right of conquest: they neither loved nor trusted; they were neither trusted nor beloved: the contempt of the princes was mixed with fear, and the fear of the natives was mingled with hatred and resentment.
 Every object of desire, a horse, a woman, a garden, tempted and gratified the rapaciousness of the strangers; (29) and the avarice of their chiefs was only colored by the more specious names of ambition and glory.
 The <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> counts were sometimes joined in the league of injustice: in their domestic quarrels they disputed the spoils of the people: the virtues of <PERSON>William</PERSON> were buried in his grave; and Drogo, his brother and successor, was better qualified to lead the valour, than to restrain the violence, of his peers.
 Under the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> Monomachus, the policy, rather than benevolence, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court, attempted to relieve <GPE>Italy</GPE> from this adherent mischief, more grievous than a flight of Barbarians; (30) and Argyrus, the son of Melo, was invested for this purpose with the most lofty titles (31) and the most ample commission.
 The memory of his father might recommend him to the Normans; and he had already engaged their voluntary service to quell the revolt of Maniaces, and to avenge their own and the public injury.
 It was the design of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to transplant the warlike colony from the <NORP>Italian</NORP> provinces to the Persian war; and the son of <PERSON>Melo</PERSON> distributed among the chiefs the gold and manufactures of Greece, as the first-fruits of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> bounty.
 But his arts were baffled by the sense and spirit of the conquerors of Apulia: his gifts, or at least his proposals, were rejected; and they unanimously refused to relinquish their possessions and their hopes for the distant prospect of <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> fortune.
 League of the Pope and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, A.
D.
 1049-1054.
 After the means of persuasion had failed, <PERSON>Argyrus</PERSON> resolved to compel or to destroy: the <NORP>Latin</NORP> powers were solicited against the common enemy; and an offensive alliance was formed of the pope and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West.
 The throne of St.
 Peter was occupied by <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, a simple saint, (32) of a temper most apt to deceive himself and the world, and whose venerable character would consecrate with the name of piety the measures least compatible with the practice of religion.
 His humanity was affected by the complaints, perhaps the calumnies, of an injured people: the impious <NORP>Normans</NORP> had interrupted the payment of tithes; and the temporal sword might be lawfully unsheathed against the sacrilegious robbers, who were deaf to the censures of the church.
 As a <NORP>German</NORP> of noble birth and royal kindred, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> had free access to the court and confidence of the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Third; and in search of arms and allies, his ardent zeal transported him from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> to Saxony, from the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> to the Tyber.
 During these hostile preparations, <PERSON>Argyrus</PERSON> indulged himself in the use of secret and guilty weapons: a crowd of <NORP>Normans</NORP> became the victims of public or private revenge; A.
D.
 1051and the valiant <PERSON>Drogo</PERSON> was murdered in a church.
 But his spirit survived in his brother Humphrey, the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> count of Apulia.
 The assassins were chastised; and the son of Melo, overthrown and wounded, was driven from the field, to hide his shame behind the walls of Bari, and to await the tardy succour of his allies.
 Expedition of pope <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> IX.
 Against the Normans, A.
D.
 1053.
 But the power of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was distracted by a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> war; the mind of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was feeble and irresolute; and the pope, instead of repassing the <LOC>Alps</LOC> with a <NORP>German</NORP> army, was accompanied only by a guard of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Swabians</NORP> and some volunteers of Lorraine.
 In his long progress from <GPE>Mantua</GPE> to Beneventum, a vile and promiscuous multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> was enlisted under the holy standard: (33) the priest and the robber slept in the same tent; the pikes and crosses were intermingled in the front; and the martial saint repeated the lessons of his youth in the order of march, of encampment, and of combat.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> could muster in the field no more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand horse, with a handful of infantry: the defection of the natives intercepted their provisions and retreat; and their spirit, incapable of fear, was chilled for a moment by superstitious awe.
 On the hostile approach of Leo, they knelt without disgrace or reluctance before their spiritual father.
 But the pope was inexorable; his lofty <NORP>Germans</NORP> affected to deride the diminutive stature of their adversaries; and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were informed that death or exile was their only alternative.
 Flight they disdained, and, as many of them had been <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days without tasting food, they embraced the assurance of a more easy and honourable death.
 They climbed the hill of Civitella, descended into the plain, and charged in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> divisions the army of the pope.
 His defeat and captivity, June 18.
 On the left, and in the centre, <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> count of Aversa, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> the famous Guiscard, attacked, broke, routed, and pursued the <NORP>Italian</NORP> multitudes, who fought without discipline, and fled without shame.
 A harder trial was reserved for the valour of Count Humphrey, who led the cavalry of the right wing.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> (34) have been described as unskillful in the management of the horse and the lance, but on foot they formed a strong and impenetrable phalanx; and neither man, nor steed, nor armour, could resist the weight of their long and two-handed swords.
 After a severe conflict, they were encompassed by the squadrons returning from the pursuit; and died in the ranks with the esteem of their foes, and the satisfaction of revenge.
 The gates of <PERSON>Civitella</PERSON> were shut against the flying pope, and he was overtaken by the pious conquerors, who kissed his feet, to implore his blessing and the absolution of their sinful victory.
 The soldiers beheld in their enemy and captive the vicar of Christ; and, though we may suppose the policy of the chiefs, it is probable that they were infected by the popular superstition.
 In the calm of retirement, the well-meaning pope deplored the effusion of <NORP>Christian</NORP> blood, which must be imputed to his account: he felt, that he had been the author of sin and scandal; and as his undertaking had failed, the indecency of his military character was universally condemned.
 (35) With these dispositions, he listened to the offers of a beneficial treaty; deserted an alliance which he had preached as the cause of God; and ratified the past and future conquests of the Normans.
 Origin of the papal investitures to the Normans.
 By whatever hands they had been usurped, the provinces of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were a part of the donation of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and the patrimony of St.
 Peter: the grant and the acceptance confirmed the mutual claims of the pontiff and the adventurers.
 They promised to support each other with spiritual and temporal arms; a tribute or quitrent of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> pence was afterwards stipulated for every ploughland; and since this memorable transaction, the kingdom of <GPE>Naples</GPE> has remained above <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred <DATE>years</DATE> a fief of the Holy See.
 (36) Birth and character of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, A.
D.
 1020-1085.
 The pedigree of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> (37) is variously deduced from the peasants and the dukes of Normandy: from the peasants, by the pride and ignorance of a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> princess; (38) from the dukes, by the ignorance and flattery of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> subjects.
 (39) His genuine descent may be ascribed to the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> or middle order of private nobility.
 (40) He sprang from a race of valvassors or bannerets, of the diocese of Coutances, in the Lower Normandy: the castle of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was their honourable seat: his father <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> was conspicuous in the court and army of the duke; and his military service was furnished by <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> soldiers or knights.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> marriages, of a rank not unworthy of his own, made him the father of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> sons, who were educated at home by the impartial tenderness of his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife.
 But a narrow patrimony was insufficient for this numerous and daring progeny; they saw around the neighbourhood the mischiefs of poverty and discord, and resolved to seek in foreign wars a more glorious inheritance.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> only remained to perpetuate the race, and cherish their father's age: their <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> brothers, as they successfully attained the vigour of manhood, departed from the castle, passed the Alps, and joined the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> camp of the Normans.
 The elder were prompted by native spirit; their success encouraged their younger brethren, and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> in seniority, William, Drogo, and Humphrey, deserved to be the chiefs of their nation and the founders of the new republic.
 <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was the eldest of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> sons of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> marriage; and even the reluctant praise of his foes has endowed him with the heroic qualities of a soldier and a statesman.
 His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army: his limbs were cast in the true proportion of strength and gracefulness; and to the decline of life, he maintained the patient vigour of health and the commanding dignity of his form.
 His complexion was ruddy, his shoulders were broad, his hair and beard were long and of a flaxen colour, his eyes sparkled with fire, and his voice, like that of Achilles, could impress obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle.
 In the ruder ages of chivalry, such qualifications are not below the notice of the poet or historians: they may observe that Robert, at once, and with equal dexterity, could wield in the right hand his sword, his lance in the left; that in the battle of <PERSON>Civitella</PERSON> he was thrice unhorsed; and that in the close of that memorable day he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valour from the warriors of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies.
 (41) His boundless ambition was founded on the consciousness of superior worth: in the pursuit of greatness, he was never arrested by the scruples of justice, and seldom moved by the feelings of humanity: though not insensible of fame, the choice of open or clandestine means was determined only by his present advantage.
 The surname of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> (42) was applied to this master of political wisdom, which is too often confounded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is praised by the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> poet for excelling the cunning of <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> and the eloquence of Cicero.
 Yet these arts were disguised by an appearance of military frankness: in his highest fortune, he was accessible and courteous to his fellow-soldiers; and while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects, he affected in his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion of his country.
 He grasped with a rapacious, that he might distribute with a liberal, hand: his primitive indigence had taught the habits of frugality; the gain of a merchant was not below his attention; and his prisoners were tortured with slow and unfeeling cruelty, to force a discovery of their secret treasure.
 According to the Greeks, he departed from <GPE>Normandy</GPE> with only <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> followers on horseback and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> on foot; yet even this allowance appears too bountiful: the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> as a pilgrim; and his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> military band was levied among the adventurers of Italy.
 His brothers and countrymen had divided the fertile lands of Apulia; but they guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice; the aspiring youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria, and in his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploits against the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the natives, it is not easy to discriminate the hero from the robber.
 To surprise a castle or a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to plunder the adjacent villages for necessary food, were the obscure labours which formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body.
 The volunteers of <GPE>Normandy</GPE> adhered to his standard; and, under his command, the peasants of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> assumed the name and character of Normans.
 His ambition and success, A.
D.
 1054-1080.
 As the genius of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> expanded with his fortune, he awakened the jealousy of his elder brother, by whom, in a transient quarrel, his life was threatened and his liberty restrained.
 After the death of Humphrey, the tender age of his sons excluded them from the command; they were reduced to a private estate, by the ambition of their guardian and uncle; and <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was exalted on a buckler, and saluted count of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and general of the republic.
 With an increase of authority and of force, he resumed the conquest of Calabria, and soon aspired to a rank that should raise him forever above the heads of his equals.
 By some acts of rapine or sacrilege, he had incurred a papal excommunication; but <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> was easily persuaded that the divisions of friends could terminate only in their mutual prejudice; that the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were the faithful champions of the Holy See; and it was safer to trust the alliance of a prince than the caprice of an aristocracy.
 A synod of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred bishops was convened at Melphi; and the count interrupted an important enterprise to guard the person and execute the decrees of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 His gratitude and policy conferred on <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and his posterity the ducal title, (43) with the investiture of Apulia, Calabria, and all the lands, both in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, which his sword could rescue from the schismatic <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the unbelieving Saracens.
 (44) This apostolic sanction might justify his arms; but the obedience of a free and victorious people could not be transferred without their consent; and <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> dissembled his elevation till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by the conquest of <PERSON>Consenza</PERSON> and Reggio.
 In the hour of triumph, he assembled his troops, and solicited the <NORP>Normans</NORP> to confirm by their suffrage the judgment of the vicar of Christ: Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1060.
 the soldiers hailed with joyful acclamations their valiant duke; and the counts, his former equals, pronounced the oath of fidelity with hollow smiles and secret indignation.
 After this inauguration, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> styled himself, "By the grace of God and St.
 Peter, duke of Apulia, Calabria, and hereafter of Sicily;" and it was the labour of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> to deserve and realize these lofty appellations.
 Such tardy progress, in a narrow space, may seem unworthy of the abilities of the chief and the spirit of the nation; but the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were few in number; their resources were scanty; their service was voluntary and precarious.
 The bravest designs of the duke were sometimes opposed by the free voice of his parliament of barons: the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> counts of popular election conspired against his authority; and against their perfidious uncle, the sons of <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> demanded justice and revenge.
 By his policy and vigour, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> discovered their plots, suppressed their rebellions, and punished the guilty with death or exile: but in these domestic feuds, his years, and the national strength, were unprofitably consumed.
 After the defeat of his foreign enemies, the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, their broken forces retreated to the strong and populous cities of the sea-coast.
 They excelled in the arts of fortification and defence; the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were accustomed to serve on horseback in the field, and their rude attempts could only succeed by the efforts of persevering courage.
 The resistance of <GPE>Salerno</GPE> was maintained above eight months; the siege or blockade of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> lasted near <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years.
 In these actions the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke was the foremost in every danger; in every fatigue the last and most patient.
 As he pressed the citadel of Salerno, a huge stone from the rampart shattered <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his military engines; and by a splinter he was wounded in the breast.
 Before the gates of Bari, he lodged in a miserable hut or barrack, composed of dry branches, and thatched with straw; a perilous station, on all sides open to the inclemency of the <DATE>winter</DATE> and the spears of the enemy.
 (45) His <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> correspond with the limits of the present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his arms have not been dissevered by the revolutions of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred years.
 (46) The monarchy has been composed of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> provinces of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> and Apulia, of the <GPE>Lombard</GPE> principality of Salerno, the republic of Amalphi, and the inland dependencies of the large and ancient duchy of Beneventum.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> districts only were exempted from the common law of subjection; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> forever, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> last till the middle of the succeeding century.
 The city and immediate territory of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> had been transferred, by gift or exchange, from the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; and although this holy land was sometimes invaded, the name of St.
 Peter was finally more potent than the sword of the Normans.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> colony of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> subdued and held the state of Capua; and her princes were reduced to beg their bread before the palace of their fathers.
 The dukes of Naples, the present metropolis, maintained the popular freedom, under the shadow of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 Among the new acquisitions of Guiscard, the science of Salerno, (47) and the trade of Amalphi, (48) may detain for a moment the curiosity of the reader.
 School of Salerno.
 I.
 Of the learned faculties, jurisprudence implies the previous establishment of laws and property; and theology may perhaps be superseded by the full light of religion and reason.
 But the savage and the sage must alike implore the assistance of physic; and, if our diseases are inflamed by luxury, the mischiefs of blows and wounds would be more frequent in the ruder ages of society.
 The treasures of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> medicine had been communicated to the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> colonies of Africa, Spain, and Sicily; and in the intercourse of peace and war, a spark of knowledge had been kindled and cherished at Salerno, an illustrious city, in which the men were honest and the women beautiful.
 (49) A school, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> that arose in the darkness of Europe, was consecrated to the healing art: the conscience of monks and bishops was reconciled to that salutary and lucrative profession; and a crowd of patients, of the most eminent rank, and most distant climates, invited or visited the physicians of Salerno.
 They were protected by the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquerors; and Guiscard, though bred in arms, could discern the merit and value of a philosopher.
 After a pilgrimage of thirty-nine years, Constantine, an <NORP>African</NORP> Christian, returned from Bagdad, a master of the language and learning of the Arabians; and <GPE>Salerno</GPE> was enriched by the practice, the lessons, and the writings of the pupil of Avicenna.
 The school of medicine has long slept in the name of a university; but her precepts are abridged in a string of aphorisms, bound together in the <NORP>Leonine</NORP> verses, or <NORP>Latin</NORP> rhymes, of the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> century.
 (50) Trade of Amalphi.
 II.
 Seven miles to the west of Salerno, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> to the south of Naples, the obscure town of <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> displayed the power and rewards of industry.
 The land, however fertile, was of narrow extent; but the sea was accessible and open: the inhabitants <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assumed the office of supplying the western world with the manufactures and productions of the East; and this useful traffic was the source of their opulence and freedom.
 The government was popular, under the administration of a duke and the supremacy of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 Fifty thousand citizens were numbered in the walls of Amalphi; nor was any city more abundantly provided with gold, silver, and the objects of precious luxury.
 The mariners who swarmed in her port, excelled in the theory and practice of navigation and astronomy: and the discovery of the compass, which has opened the globe, is owing to their ingenuity or good fortune.
 Their trade was extended to the coasts, or at least to the commodities, of Africa, Arabia, and India: and their settlements in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, acquired the privileges of independent colonies.
 (51) After <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <DATE>years</DATE> of prosperity, <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> was oppressed by the arms of the Normans, and sacked by the jealousy of Pisa; but the poverty of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand fisherman is yet dignified by the remains of an arsenal, a cathedral, and the palaces of royal merchants.
 Conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by count Roger, A.
D.
 1060-1090.
 Roger, the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> and last of the sons of Tancred, had been long detained in <GPE>Normandy</GPE> by his own and his father' age.
 He accepted the welcome summons; hastened to the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> camp; and deserved at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> the esteem, and afterwards the envy, of his elder brother.
 Their valour and ambition were equal; but the youth, the beauty, the elegant manners, of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> engaged the disinterested love of the soldiers and people.
 So scanty was his allowance for himself and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> followers, that he descended from conquest to robbery, and from robbery to domestic theft; and so loose were the notions of property, that, by his own historian, at his special command, he is accused of stealing horses from a stable at Melphi.
 (52) His spirit emerged from poverty and disgrace: from these base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy war; and the invasion of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was seconded by the zeal and policy of his brother Guiscard.
 After the retreat of the Greeks, the idolaters, a most audacious reproach of the Catholics, had retrieved their losses and possessions; but the deliverance of the island, so vainly undertaken by the forces of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, was achieved by a small and private band of adventurers.
 (53) In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attempt, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> braved, in an open boat, the real and fabulous dangers of <PRODUCT>Scylla</PRODUCT> and Charybdis; landed with only sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; drove the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> to the gates of <GPE>Messina</GPE> and safely returned with the spoils of the adjacent country.
 In the fortress of Trani, his active and patient courage were equally conspicuous.
 In his old age he related with pleasure, that, by the distress of the siege, himself, and the countess his wife, had been reduced to a single cloak or mantle, which they wore alternately; that in a sally his horse had been slain, and he was dragged away by the Saracens; but that he owed his rescue to his good sword, and had retreated with his saddle on his back, lest the meanest trophy might be left in the hands of the miscreants.
 In the siege of Trani, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Normans</NORP> withstood and repulsed the forces of the island.
 In the field of Ceramio, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand horse and foot were overthrown by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> soldiers, without reckoning St.
 George, who fought on horseback in the foremost ranks.
 The captive banners, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> camels, were reserved for the successor of St.
 Peter; and had these barbaric spoils been exposed, not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol, they might have revived the memory of the <NORP>Punic</NORP> triumphs.
 These insufficient numbers of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> most probably denote their knights, the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank, each of whom was attended by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> followers in the field; (54) yet, with the aid of this interpretation, and after every fair allowance on the side of valour, arms, and reputation, the discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce the prudent reader to the alternative of a miracle or a fable.
 The <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> derived a frequent and powerful succour from their countrymen of Africa: in the siege of Palermo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry was assisted by the galleys of Pisa; and, in the hour of action, the envy of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers was sublimed to a generous and invincible emulation.
 After a war of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, (55) Roger, with the title of great count, obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most fruitful island of the Mediterranean; and his administration displays a liberal and enlightened mind, above the limits of his age and education.
 The <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were maintained in the free enjoyment of their religion and property: (56) a philosopher and physician of Mazara, of the race of Mahomet, harangued the conqueror, and was invited to court; his geography of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> climates was translated into Latin; and Roger, after a diligent perusal, preferred the work of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> to the writings of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> Ptolemy.
 (57) A remnant of <NORP>Christian</NORP> natives had promoted the success of the Normans: they were rewarded by the triumph of the cross.
 The island was restored to the jurisdiction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; new bishops were planted in the principal cities; and the clergy was satisfied by a liberal endowment of churches and monasteries.
 Yet the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> hero asserted the rights of the civil magistrate.
 Instead of resigning the investiture of benefices, he dexterously applied to his own profit the papal claims: the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged, by the singular bull, which declares the princes of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> hereditary and perpetual legates of the Holy See.
 (58) <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> invades the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1081.
 To <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was more glorious than beneficial: the possession of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> was inadequate to his ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> occasion of invading, perhaps of subduing, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire of the East.
 (59) From his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife, the partner of his humble fortune, he had been divorced under the pretence of consanguinity; and her son <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was destined to imitate, rather than to succeed, his illustrious father.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger; their <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> daughters were given in honorable nuptials, (60) and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of them was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a beautiful youth, the son and heir of the emperor Michael.
 (61) But the throne of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was shaken by a revolution: the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> family of <PERSON>Ducas</PERSON> was confined to the palace or the cloister; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> deplored, and resented, the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally.
 A Greek, who styled himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared at Salerno, and related the adventures of his fall and flight.
 That unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the pomp and titles of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity: in his triumphal progress through <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> (62) was saluted with the tears and acclamations of the people; and Pope <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> exhorted the bishops to preach, and the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> to fight, in the pious work of his restoration.
 His conversations with <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> were frequent and familiar; and their mutual promises were justified by the valour of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and the treasures of the East.
 Yet this Michael, by the confession of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, was a pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled from his convent, or a domestic who had served in the palace.
 The fraud had been contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after this pretender had given a decent colour to his arms, he would sink, at the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity.
 But victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks; and the ardour of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> was much inferior to their credulity: the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> veterans wished to enjoy the harvest of their toils, and the unwarlike <NORP>Italians</NORP> trembled at the known and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition.
 In his new levies, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> exerted the influence of gifts and promises, the terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some acts of violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy were pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting prince.
 After <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years' incessant preparations the land and naval forces were assembled at Otranto, at the heel, or extreme promontory, of Italy; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was accompanied by his wife, who fought by his side, his son Bohemond, and the representative of the emperor Michael.
 Thirteen hundred knights (63) of <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> race or discipline, formed the sinews of the army, which might be swelled to <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand (64) followers of every denomination.
 The men, the horses, the arms, the engines, the wooden towers, covered with raw hides, were embarked on board <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> vessels: the transports had been built in the ports of Italy, and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the republic of Ragusa.
 Siege of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, June 17.
 At the mouth of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf, the shores of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Epirus</LOC> incline towards each other.
 The space between <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> and Durazzo, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> passage, is no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles; (65) at the last station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; (66) and this narrow distance had suggested to <PERSON>Pyrrhus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> the sublime or extravagant idea of a bridge.
 Before the general embarkation, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke despatched <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> with <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> galleys to seize or threaten the Isle of Corfu, to survey the opposite coast, and to secure a harbour in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Vallona</GPE> for the landing of the troops.
 They passed and landed without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks.
 The islands of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> and the maritime towns were subdued by the arms or the name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> (I use the modern appellation) to the siege of Durazzo.
 That city, the western key of the empire, was guarded by ancient renown, and recent fortifications, by <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, a patrician, victorious in the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> wars, and a numerous garrison of <NORP>Albanians</NORP> and Macedonians, who, in every age, have maintained the character of soldiers.
 In the prosecution of his enterprise, the courage of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was assailed by every form of danger and mischance.
 In the most propitious season of the year, as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow unexpectedly arose: the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was swelled by the raging blast of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the <NORP>Acroceraunian</NORP> rocks.
 (67) The sails, the masts, and the oars, were shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were covered with the fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged.
 The ducal galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> halted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of his loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had explored the ocean from <LOC>Greenland</LOC> to Mount Atlas, and who smiled at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean.
 They had wept during the tempest; they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians, who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> day's action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, (68) who led the naval powers of his father.
 All night the galleys of the republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions, the station of their archers, the weight of their javelins, and the borrowed aid of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire.
 The <NORP>Apulian</NORP> and <NORP>Ragusian</NORP> vessels fled to the shore, several were cut from their cables, and dragged away by the conqueror; and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke.
 A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo, and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and provision.
 That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease; <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred knights perished by an inglorious death; and the list of burials (if all could obtain a decent burial) amounted to <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand persons.
 Under these calamities, the mind of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> alone was firm and invincible; and while he collected new forces from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Sicily, he battered, or scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo.
 But his industry and valour were encountered by equal valour and more perfect industry.
 A movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers, had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart: but the descent of the door or drawbridge was checked by an enormous beam, and the wooden structure was constantly consumed by artificial flames.
 The army and the march of the emperor Alexius, April-September.
 While the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was attacked by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in the East, east, and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the West, the aged successor of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the founder of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasty.
 The princess Anne, his daughter and historian, observes, in her affected style, that even <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> was unequal to a double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a hasty peace with the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo.
 On his accession, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> found the camp without soldiers, and the treasury without money; yet such were the vigour and activity of his measures, that in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months he assembled an army of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand men, (69) and performed a march of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 His troops were levied in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, from <LOC>Peloponnesus</LOC> to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse-guards; and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes, some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed with the purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of affluence and dignity.
 Their youthful ardour might animate the multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their importunate clamours for speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded and starved the besieging army.
 The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world: the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the garrisons of Anatolia, or <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, had been purchased by the evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks.
 The strength of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> army consisted in the Varangians, the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule.
 Under the yoke of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conqueror, the <NORP>Danes</NORP> and <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> were oppressed and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long pilgrimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and revenge.
 They were entertained in the service of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> station was in a new city on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore: but <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valour.
 (70) The name of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in <LOC>Epirus</LOC> the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings.
 The <NORP>Varangians</NORP> were supported by some companies of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> or Latins; and the rebels, who had fled to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> from the tyranny of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their revenge.
 In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the impure aid of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> or <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valour.
 (71) The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> horse were opposed to the lances of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry.
 On the report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> assembled a council of his principal officers.
 "You behold," said he, "your danger: it is urgent and inevitable.
 The hills are covered with arms and standards; and the emperor of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> is accustomed to wars and triumphs.
 Obedience and union are our only safety; and I am ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader.
" The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke thus continued: "Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and deprive cowardice of the means of escape.
 Let us burn our vessels and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the place of our nativity and our burial.
" The resolution was unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his lines, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of the enemy.
 His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious, perhaps, that on the same ground <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had formerly disputed the empire of the world.
 (72) Battle of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, <DATE>October</DATE> 18.
 Against the advice of his wisest captains, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> resolved to risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town.
 He marched in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns to surprise the <NORP>Normans</NORP> before daybreak on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the archers formed the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line; and the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> claimed the honours of the vanguard.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 The <NORP>Lombards</NORP> and <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the garrison, and the coast was lined with the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys, who played their engines among the disorderly throng.
 On the verge of ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.
 Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as a warlike Amazon, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> goddess: (73) though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops.
 (74) Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: "Whither," he cried aloud, "whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and death is less grievous than servitude.
" The moment was decisive: as the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry.
 (75) <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune.
 The princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance, which had shivered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> helmet.
 His desperate valour broke through a squadron of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who opposed his flight; and after wandering <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus.
 The victorious <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp, and the glory of defeating an army <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times more numerous than his own.
 A multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> had been the victims of their own fears; but only <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> of his knights were slain in this memorable day.
 In the <NORP>Roman</NORP> host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and English, amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand: (76) the plain of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was more honorable than his life.
 <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> taken, A.
D.
 1082, February 8.
 It is more than probable that <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks.
 After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo; and a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> commander supplied the place of <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
 The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy.
 (77) Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage.
 At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the walls; the light <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ascended in silence; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror.
 Yet they defended the streets <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days against an enemy already master of the rampart; and near <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months elapsed between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> investment and the final surrender of the place.
 From Durazzo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke advanced into the heart of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> or Albania; traversed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mountains of Thessaly; surprised <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> tremble.
 A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs.
 By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> king of Germany.
 Return of Robert, and the actions of Bohemond.
 Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> counts, exhorting <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the authority of their leader.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of his father; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> destroyers are compared, by the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former.
 (78) After winning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, (79) which contained the treasure and magazines of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp.
 Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times.
 In the poverty of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the desertion of the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers were exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been taught by experience, that the formidable cavalry of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of motion; (80) his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Larissa</GPE> the events of war were protracted and balanced.
 The courage of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was always conspicuous, and often successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the advantage, rather than the honour, of victory.
 After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> III invited by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1081.
 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.
 (84) But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people adhered to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; Besieges Rome, A.
D.
 1081-1084.
 and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany.
 In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war.
 The gates, the bridges, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> hostages, were delivered into his hands: A.
D.
 1081-1084, March 21.
 the anti-pope, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: March 24.
 the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; March 31.
 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.
D.
 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.
 Final extinction of the Normans, A.

 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.

 Against the Normans, A.
D.
 1053.
 But the power of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was distracted by a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> war; the mind of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was feeble and irresolute; and the pope, instead of repassing the <LOC>Alps</LOC> with a <NORP>German</NORP> army, was accompanied only by a guard of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Swabians</NORP> and some volunteers of Lorraine.
 In his long progress from <GPE>Mantua</GPE> to Beneventum, a vile and promiscuous multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> was enlisted under the holy standard: (33) the priest and the robber slept in the same tent; the pikes and crosses were intermingled in the front; and the martial saint repeated the lessons of his youth in the order of march, of encampment, and of combat.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> could muster in the field no more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand horse, with a handful of infantry: the defection of the natives intercepted their provisions and retreat; and their spirit, incapable of fear, was chilled for a moment by superstitious awe.
 On the hostile approach of Leo, they knelt without disgrace or reluctance before their spiritual father.
 But the pope was inexorable; his lofty <NORP>Germans</NORP> affected to deride the diminutive stature of their adversaries; and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were informed that death or exile was their only alternative.
 Flight they disdained, and, as many of them had been <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days without tasting food, they embraced the assurance of a more easy and honourable death.
 They climbed the hill of Civitella, descended into the plain, and charged in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> divisions the army of the pope.
 His defeat and captivity, June 18.
 On the left, and in the centre, <PERSON>Richard</PERSON> count of Aversa, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> the famous Guiscard, attacked, broke, routed, and pursued the <NORP>Italian</NORP> multitudes, who fought without discipline, and fled without shame.
 A harder trial was reserved for the valour of Count Humphrey, who led the cavalry of the right wing.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> (34) have been described as unskillful in the management of the horse and the lance, but on foot they formed a strong and impenetrable phalanx; and neither man, nor steed, nor armour, could resist the weight of their long and two-handed swords.
 After a severe conflict, they were encompassed by the squadrons returning from the pursuit; and died in the ranks with the esteem of their foes, and the satisfaction of revenge.
 The gates of <PERSON>Civitella</PERSON> were shut against the flying pope, and he was overtaken by the pious conquerors, who kissed his feet, to implore his blessing and the absolution of their sinful victory.
 The soldiers beheld in their enemy and captive the vicar of Christ; and, though we may suppose the policy of the chiefs, it is probable that they were infected by the popular superstition.
 In the calm of retirement, the well-meaning pope deplored the effusion of <NORP>Christian</NORP> blood, which must be imputed to his account: he felt, that he had been the author of sin and scandal; and as his undertaking had failed, the indecency of his military character was universally condemned.
 (35) With these dispositions, he listened to the offers of a beneficial treaty; deserted an alliance which he had preached as the cause of God; and ratified the past and future conquests of the Normans.
 Origin of the papal investitures to the Normans.
 By whatever hands they had been usurped, the provinces of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were a part of the donation of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and the patrimony of St.
 Peter: the grant and the acceptance confirmed the mutual claims of the pontiff and the adventurers.
 They promised to support each other with spiritual and temporal arms; a tribute or quitrent of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> pence was afterwards stipulated for every ploughland; and since this memorable transaction, the kingdom of <GPE>Naples</GPE> has remained above <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred <DATE>years</DATE> a fief of the Holy See.
 (36) Birth and character of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, A.
D.
 1020-1085.
 The pedigree of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> (37) is variously deduced from the peasants and the dukes of Normandy: from the peasants, by the pride and ignorance of a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> princess; (38) from the dukes, by the ignorance and flattery of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> subjects.
 (39) His genuine descent may be ascribed to the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> or middle order of private nobility.
 (40) He sprang from a race of valvassors or bannerets, of the diocese of Coutances, in the Lower Normandy: the castle of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was their honourable seat: his father <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> was conspicuous in the court and army of the duke; and his military service was furnished by <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> soldiers or knights.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> marriages, of a rank not unworthy of his own, made him the father of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> sons, who were educated at home by the impartial tenderness of his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife.
 But a narrow patrimony was insufficient for this numerous and daring progeny; they saw around the neighbourhood the mischiefs of poverty and discord, and resolved to seek in foreign wars a more glorious inheritance.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> only remained to perpetuate the race, and cherish their father's age: their <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> brothers, as they successfully attained the vigour of manhood, departed from the castle, passed the Alps, and joined the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> camp of the Normans.
 The elder were prompted by native spirit; their success encouraged their younger brethren, and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> in seniority, William, Drogo, and Humphrey, deserved to be the chiefs of their nation and the founders of the new republic.
 <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was the eldest of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> sons of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> marriage; and even the reluctant praise of his foes has endowed him with the heroic qualities of a soldier and a statesman.
 His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army: his limbs were cast in the true proportion of strength and gracefulness; and to the decline of life, he maintained the patient vigour of health and the commanding dignity of his form.
 His complexion was ruddy, his shoulders were broad, his hair and beard were long and of a flaxen colour, his eyes sparkled with fire, and his voice, like that of Achilles, could impress obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle.
 In the ruder ages of chivalry, such qualifications are not below the notice of the poet or historians: they may observe that Robert, at once, and with equal dexterity, could wield in the right hand his sword, his lance in the left; that in the battle of <PERSON>Civitella</PERSON> he was thrice unhorsed; and that in the close of that memorable day he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valour from the warriors of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies.
 (41) His boundless ambition was founded on the consciousness of superior worth: in the pursuit of greatness, he was never arrested by the scruples of justice, and seldom moved by the feelings of humanity: though not insensible of fame, the choice of open or clandestine means was determined only by his present advantage.
 The surname of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> (42) was applied to this master of political wisdom, which is too often confounded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is praised by the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> poet for excelling the cunning of <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> and the eloquence of Cicero.
 Yet these arts were disguised by an appearance of military frankness: in his highest fortune, he was accessible and courteous to his fellow-soldiers; and while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects, he affected in his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion of his country.
 He grasped with a rapacious, that he might distribute with a liberal, hand: his primitive indigence had taught the habits of frugality; the gain of a merchant was not below his attention; and his prisoners were tortured with slow and unfeeling cruelty, to force a discovery of their secret treasure.
 According to the Greeks, he departed from <GPE>Normandy</GPE> with only <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> followers on horseback and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> on foot; yet even this allowance appears too bountiful: the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> as a pilgrim; and his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> military band was levied among the adventurers of Italy.
 His brothers and countrymen had divided the fertile lands of Apulia; but they guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice; the aspiring youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria, and in his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploits against the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the natives, it is not easy to discriminate the hero from the robber.
 To surprise a castle or a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to plunder the adjacent villages for necessary food, were the obscure labours which formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body.
 The volunteers of <GPE>Normandy</GPE> adhered to his standard; and, under his command, the peasants of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> assumed the name and character of Normans.
 His ambition and success, A.
D.
 1054-1080.
 As the genius of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> expanded with his fortune, he awakened the jealousy of his elder brother, by whom, in a transient quarrel, his life was threatened and his liberty restrained.
 After the death of Humphrey, the tender age of his sons excluded them from the command; they were reduced to a private estate, by the ambition of their guardian and uncle; and <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was exalted on a buckler, and saluted count of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and general of the republic.
 With an increase of authority and of force, he resumed the conquest of Calabria, and soon aspired to a rank that should raise him forever above the heads of his equals.
 By some acts of rapine or sacrilege, he had incurred a papal excommunication; but <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> was easily persuaded that the divisions of friends could terminate only in their mutual prejudice; that the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were the faithful champions of the Holy See; and it was safer to trust the alliance of a prince than the caprice of an aristocracy.
 A synod of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred bishops was convened at Melphi; and the count interrupted an important enterprise to guard the person and execute the decrees of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 His gratitude and policy conferred on <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and his posterity the ducal title, (43) with the investiture of Apulia, Calabria, and all the lands, both in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, which his sword could rescue from the schismatic <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the unbelieving Saracens.
 (44) This apostolic sanction might justify his arms; but the obedience of a free and victorious people could not be transferred without their consent; and <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> dissembled his elevation till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by the conquest of <PERSON>Consenza</PERSON> and Reggio.
 In the hour of triumph, he assembled his troops, and solicited the <NORP>Normans</NORP> to confirm by their suffrage the judgment of the vicar of Christ: Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1060.
 the soldiers hailed with joyful acclamations their valiant duke; and the counts, his former equals, pronounced the oath of fidelity with hollow smiles and secret indignation.
 After this inauguration, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> styled himself, "By the grace of God and St.
 Peter, duke of Apulia, Calabria, and hereafter of Sicily;" and it was the labour of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> to deserve and realize these lofty appellations.
 Such tardy progress, in a narrow space, may seem unworthy of the abilities of the chief and the spirit of the nation; but the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were few in number; their resources were scanty; their service was voluntary and precarious.
 The bravest designs of the duke were sometimes opposed by the free voice of his parliament of barons: the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> counts of popular election conspired against his authority; and against their perfidious uncle, the sons of <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> demanded justice and revenge.
 By his policy and vigour, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> discovered their plots, suppressed their rebellions, and punished the guilty with death or exile: but in these domestic feuds, his years, and the national strength, were unprofitably consumed.
 After the defeat of his foreign enemies, the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, their broken forces retreated to the strong and populous cities of the sea-coast.
 They excelled in the arts of fortification and defence; the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were accustomed to serve on horseback in the field, and their rude attempts could only succeed by the efforts of persevering courage.
 The resistance of <GPE>Salerno</GPE> was maintained above eight months; the siege or blockade of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> lasted near <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years.
 In these actions the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke was the foremost in every danger; in every fatigue the last and most patient.
 As he pressed the citadel of Salerno, a huge stone from the rampart shattered <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his military engines; and by a splinter he was wounded in the breast.
 Before the gates of Bari, he lodged in a miserable hut or barrack, composed of dry branches, and thatched with straw; a perilous station, on all sides open to the inclemency of the <DATE>winter</DATE> and the spears of the enemy.
 (45) His <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> correspond with the limits of the present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his arms have not been dissevered by the revolutions of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred years.
 (46) The monarchy has been composed of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> provinces of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> and Apulia, of the <GPE>Lombard</GPE> principality of Salerno, the republic of Amalphi, and the inland dependencies of the large and ancient duchy of Beneventum.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> districts only were exempted from the common law of subjection; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> forever, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> last till the middle of the succeeding century.
 The city and immediate territory of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> had been transferred, by gift or exchange, from the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; and although this holy land was sometimes invaded, the name of St.
 Peter was finally more potent than the sword of the Normans.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> colony of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> subdued and held the state of Capua; and her princes were reduced to beg their bread before the palace of their fathers.
 The dukes of Naples, the present metropolis, maintained the popular freedom, under the shadow of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 Among the new acquisitions of Guiscard, the science of Salerno, (47) and the trade of Amalphi, (48) may detain for a moment the curiosity of the reader.
 School of Salerno.
 I.
 Of the learned faculties, jurisprudence implies the previous establishment of laws and property; and theology may perhaps be superseded by the full light of religion and reason.
 But the savage and the sage must alike implore the assistance of physic; and, if our diseases are inflamed by luxury, the mischiefs of blows and wounds would be more frequent in the ruder ages of society.
 The treasures of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> medicine had been communicated to the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> colonies of Africa, Spain, and Sicily; and in the intercourse of peace and war, a spark of knowledge had been kindled and cherished at Salerno, an illustrious city, in which the men were honest and the women beautiful.
 (49) A school, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> that arose in the darkness of Europe, was consecrated to the healing art: the conscience of monks and bishops was reconciled to that salutary and lucrative profession; and a crowd of patients, of the most eminent rank, and most distant climates, invited or visited the physicians of Salerno.
 They were protected by the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquerors; and Guiscard, though bred in arms, could discern the merit and value of a philosopher.
 After a pilgrimage of thirty-nine years, Constantine, an <NORP>African</NORP> Christian, returned from Bagdad, a master of the language and learning of the Arabians; and <GPE>Salerno</GPE> was enriched by the practice, the lessons, and the writings of the pupil of Avicenna.
 The school of medicine has long slept in the name of a university; but her precepts are abridged in a string of aphorisms, bound together in the <NORP>Leonine</NORP> verses, or <NORP>Latin</NORP> rhymes, of the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> century.
 (50) Trade of Amalphi.
 II.
 Seven miles to the west of Salerno, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> to the south of Naples, the obscure town of <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> displayed the power and rewards of industry.
 The land, however fertile, was of narrow extent; but the sea was accessible and open: the inhabitants <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assumed the office of supplying the western world with the manufactures and productions of the East; and this useful traffic was the source of their opulence and freedom.
 The government was popular, under the administration of a duke and the supremacy of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 Fifty thousand citizens were numbered in the walls of Amalphi; nor was any city more abundantly provided with gold, silver, and the objects of precious luxury.
 The mariners who swarmed in her port, excelled in the theory and practice of navigation and astronomy: and the discovery of the compass, which has opened the globe, is owing to their ingenuity or good fortune.
 Their trade was extended to the coasts, or at least to the commodities, of Africa, Arabia, and India: and their settlements in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, acquired the privileges of independent colonies.
 (51) After <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <DATE>years</DATE> of prosperity, <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> was oppressed by the arms of the Normans, and sacked by the jealousy of Pisa; but the poverty of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand fisherman is yet dignified by the remains of an arsenal, a cathedral, and the palaces of royal merchants.
 Conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by count Roger, A.
D.
 1060-1090.
 Roger, the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> and last of the sons of Tancred, had been long detained in <GPE>Normandy</GPE> by his own and his father' age.
 He accepted the welcome summons; hastened to the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> camp; and deserved at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> the esteem, and afterwards the envy, of his elder brother.
 Their valour and ambition were equal; but the youth, the beauty, the elegant manners, of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> engaged the disinterested love of the soldiers and people.
 So scanty was his allowance for himself and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> followers, that he descended from conquest to robbery, and from robbery to domestic theft; and so loose were the notions of property, that, by his own historian, at his special command, he is accused of stealing horses from a stable at Melphi.
 (52) His spirit emerged from poverty and disgrace: from these base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy war; and the invasion of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was seconded by the zeal and policy of his brother Guiscard.
 After the retreat of the Greeks, the idolaters, a most audacious reproach of the Catholics, had retrieved their losses and possessions; but the deliverance of the island, so vainly undertaken by the forces of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, was achieved by a small and private band of adventurers.
 (53) In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attempt, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> braved, in an open boat, the real and fabulous dangers of <PRODUCT>Scylla</PRODUCT> and Charybdis; landed with only sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; drove the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> to the gates of <GPE>Messina</GPE> and safely returned with the spoils of the adjacent country.
 In the fortress of Trani, his active and patient courage were equally conspicuous.
 In his old age he related with pleasure, that, by the distress of the siege, himself, and the countess his wife, had been reduced to a single cloak or mantle, which they wore alternately; that in a sally his horse had been slain, and he was dragged away by the Saracens; but that he owed his rescue to his good sword, and had retreated with his saddle on his back, lest the meanest trophy might be left in the hands of the miscreants.
 In the siege of Trani, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Normans</NORP> withstood and repulsed the forces of the island.
 In the field of Ceramio, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand horse and foot were overthrown by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> soldiers, without reckoning St.
 George, who fought on horseback in the foremost ranks.
 The captive banners, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> camels, were reserved for the successor of St.
 Peter; and had these barbaric spoils been exposed, not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol, they might have revived the memory of the <NORP>Punic</NORP> triumphs.
 These insufficient numbers of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> most probably denote their knights, the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank, each of whom was attended by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> followers in the field; (54) yet, with the aid of this interpretation, and after every fair allowance on the side of valour, arms, and reputation, the discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce the prudent reader to the alternative of a miracle or a fable.
 The <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> derived a frequent and powerful succour from their countrymen of Africa: in the siege of Palermo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry was assisted by the galleys of Pisa; and, in the hour of action, the envy of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers was sublimed to a generous and invincible emulation.
 After a war of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, (55) Roger, with the title of great count, obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most fruitful island of the Mediterranean; and his administration displays a liberal and enlightened mind, above the limits of his age and education.
 The <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were maintained in the free enjoyment of their religion and property: (56) a philosopher and physician of Mazara, of the race of Mahomet, harangued the conqueror, and was invited to court; his geography of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> climates was translated into Latin; and Roger, after a diligent perusal, preferred the work of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> to the writings of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> Ptolemy.
 (57) A remnant of <NORP>Christian</NORP> natives had promoted the success of the Normans: they were rewarded by the triumph of the cross.
 The island was restored to the jurisdiction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; new bishops were planted in the principal cities; and the clergy was satisfied by a liberal endowment of churches and monasteries.
 Yet the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> hero asserted the rights of the civil magistrate.
 Instead of resigning the investiture of benefices, he dexterously applied to his own profit the papal claims: the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged, by the singular bull, which declares the princes of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> hereditary and perpetual legates of the Holy See.
 (58) <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> invades the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1081.
 To <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was more glorious than beneficial: the possession of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> was inadequate to his ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> occasion of invading, perhaps of subduing, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire of the East.
 (59) From his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife, the partner of his humble fortune, he had been divorced under the pretence of consanguinity; and her son <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was destined to imitate, rather than to succeed, his illustrious father.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger; their <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> daughters were given in honorable nuptials, (60) and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of them was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a beautiful youth, the son and heir of the emperor Michael.
 (61) But the throne of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was shaken by a revolution: the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> family of <PERSON>Ducas</PERSON> was confined to the palace or the cloister; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> deplored, and resented, the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally.
 A Greek, who styled himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared at Salerno, and related the adventures of his fall and flight.
 That unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the pomp and titles of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity: in his triumphal progress through <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> (62) was saluted with the tears and acclamations of the people; and Pope <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> exhorted the bishops to preach, and the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> to fight, in the pious work of his restoration.
 His conversations with <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> were frequent and familiar; and their mutual promises were justified by the valour of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and the treasures of the East.
 Yet this Michael, by the confession of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, was a pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled from his convent, or a domestic who had served in the palace.
 The fraud had been contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after this pretender had given a decent colour to his arms, he would sink, at the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity.
 But victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks; and the ardour of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> was much inferior to their credulity: the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> veterans wished to enjoy the harvest of their toils, and the unwarlike <NORP>Italians</NORP> trembled at the known and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition.
 In his new levies, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> exerted the influence of gifts and promises, the terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some acts of violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy were pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting prince.
 After <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years' incessant preparations the land and naval forces were assembled at Otranto, at the heel, or extreme promontory, of Italy; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was accompanied by his wife, who fought by his side, his son Bohemond, and the representative of the emperor Michael.
 Thirteen hundred knights (63) of <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> race or discipline, formed the sinews of the army, which might be swelled to <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand (64) followers of every denomination.
 The men, the horses, the arms, the engines, the wooden towers, covered with raw hides, were embarked on board <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> vessels: the transports had been built in the ports of Italy, and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the republic of Ragusa.
 Siege of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, June 17.
 At the mouth of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf, the shores of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Epirus</LOC> incline towards each other.
 The space between <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> and Durazzo, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> passage, is no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles; (65) at the last station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; (66) and this narrow distance had suggested to <PERSON>Pyrrhus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> the sublime or extravagant idea of a bridge.
 Before the general embarkation, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke despatched <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> with <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> galleys to seize or threaten the Isle of Corfu, to survey the opposite coast, and to secure a harbour in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Vallona</GPE> for the landing of the troops.
 They passed and landed without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks.
 The islands of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> and the maritime towns were subdued by the arms or the name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> (I use the modern appellation) to the siege of Durazzo.
 That city, the western key of the empire, was guarded by ancient renown, and recent fortifications, by <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, a patrician, victorious in the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> wars, and a numerous garrison of <NORP>Albanians</NORP> and Macedonians, who, in every age, have maintained the character of soldiers.
 In the prosecution of his enterprise, the courage of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was assailed by every form of danger and mischance.
 In the most propitious season of the year, as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow unexpectedly arose: the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was swelled by the raging blast of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the <NORP>Acroceraunian</NORP> rocks.
 (67) The sails, the masts, and the oars, were shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were covered with the fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged.
 The ducal galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> halted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of his loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had explored the ocean from <LOC>Greenland</LOC> to Mount Atlas, and who smiled at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean.
 They had wept during the tempest; they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians, who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> day's action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, (68) who led the naval powers of his father.
 All night the galleys of the republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions, the station of their archers, the weight of their javelins, and the borrowed aid of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire.
 The <NORP>Apulian</NORP> and <NORP>Ragusian</NORP> vessels fled to the shore, several were cut from their cables, and dragged away by the conqueror; and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke.
 A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo, and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and provision.
 That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease; <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred knights perished by an inglorious death; and the list of burials (if all could obtain a decent burial) amounted to <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand persons.
 Under these calamities, the mind of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> alone was firm and invincible; and while he collected new forces from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Sicily, he battered, or scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo.
 But his industry and valour were encountered by equal valour and more perfect industry.
 A movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers, had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart: but the descent of the door or drawbridge was checked by an enormous beam, and the wooden structure was constantly consumed by artificial flames.
 The army and the march of the emperor Alexius, April-September.
 While the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was attacked by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in the East, east, and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the West, the aged successor of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the founder of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasty.
 The princess Anne, his daughter and historian, observes, in her affected style, that even <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> was unequal to a double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a hasty peace with the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo.
 On his accession, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> found the camp without soldiers, and the treasury without money; yet such were the vigour and activity of his measures, that in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months he assembled an army of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand men, (69) and performed a march of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 His troops were levied in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, from <LOC>Peloponnesus</LOC> to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse-guards; and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes, some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed with the purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of affluence and dignity.
 Their youthful ardour might animate the multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their importunate clamours for speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded and starved the besieging army.
 The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world: the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the garrisons of Anatolia, or <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, had been purchased by the evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks.
 The strength of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> army consisted in the Varangians, the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule.
 Under the yoke of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conqueror, the <NORP>Danes</NORP> and <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> were oppressed and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long pilgrimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and revenge.
 They were entertained in the service of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> station was in a new city on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore: but <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valour.
 (70) The name of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in <LOC>Epirus</LOC> the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings.
 The <NORP>Varangians</NORP> were supported by some companies of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> or Latins; and the rebels, who had fled to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> from the tyranny of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their revenge.
 In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the impure aid of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> or <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valour.
 (71) The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> horse were opposed to the lances of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry.
 On the report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> assembled a council of his principal officers.
 "You behold," said he, "your danger: it is urgent and inevitable.
 The hills are covered with arms and standards; and the emperor of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> is accustomed to wars and triumphs.
 Obedience and union are our only safety; and I am ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader.
" The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke thus continued: "Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and deprive cowardice of the means of escape.
 Let us burn our vessels and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the place of our nativity and our burial.
" The resolution was unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his lines, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of the enemy.
 His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious, perhaps, that on the same ground <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had formerly disputed the empire of the world.
 (72) Battle of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, <DATE>October</DATE> 18.
 Against the advice of his wisest captains, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> resolved to risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town.
 He marched in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns to surprise the <NORP>Normans</NORP> before daybreak on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the archers formed the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line; and the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> claimed the honours of the vanguard.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 The <NORP>Lombards</NORP> and <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the garrison, and the coast was lined with the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys, who played their engines among the disorderly throng.
 On the verge of ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.
 Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as a warlike Amazon, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> goddess: (73) though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops.
 (74) Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: "Whither," he cried aloud, "whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and death is less grievous than servitude.
" The moment was decisive: as the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry.
 (75) <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune.
 The princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance, which had shivered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> helmet.
 His desperate valour broke through a squadron of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who opposed his flight; and after wandering <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus.
 The victorious <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp, and the glory of defeating an army <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times more numerous than his own.
 A multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> had been the victims of their own fears; but only <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> of his knights were slain in this memorable day.
 In the <NORP>Roman</NORP> host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and English, amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand: (76) the plain of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was more honorable than his life.
 <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> taken, A.
D.
 1082, February 8.
 It is more than probable that <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks.
 After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo; and a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> commander supplied the place of <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
 The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy.
 (77) Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage.
 At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the walls; the light <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ascended in silence; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror.
 Yet they defended the streets <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days against an enemy already master of the rampart; and near <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months elapsed between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> investment and the final surrender of the place.
 From Durazzo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke advanced into the heart of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> or Albania; traversed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mountains of Thessaly; surprised <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> tremble.
 A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs.
 By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> king of Germany.
 Return of Robert, and the actions of Bohemond.
 Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> counts, exhorting <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the authority of their leader.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of his father; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> destroyers are compared, by the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former.
 (78) After winning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, (79) which contained the treasure and magazines of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp.
 Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times.
 In the poverty of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the desertion of the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers were exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been taught by experience, that the formidable cavalry of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of motion; (80) his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Larissa</GPE> the events of war were protracted and balanced.
 The courage of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was always conspicuous, and often successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the advantage, rather than the honour, of victory.
 After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> III invited by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1081.
 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.
 (84) But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people adhered to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; Besieges Rome, A.
D.
 1081-1084.
 and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany.
 In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war.
 The gates, the bridges, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> hostages, were delivered into his hands: A.
D.
 1081-1084, March 21.
 the anti-pope, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: March 24.
 the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; March 31.
 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.

 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.

 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.
 Final extinction of the Normans, A.

 1204.
 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The EAST » « Fall In The WEST » « Decline & Fall » Birth and character of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, A.
D.
 1020-1085.
 The pedigree of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> (37) is variously deduced from the peasants and the dukes of Normandy: from the peasants, by the pride and ignorance of a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> princess; (38) from the dukes, by the ignorance and flattery of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> subjects.
 (39) His genuine descent may be ascribed to the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> or middle order of private nobility.
 (40) He sprang from a race of valvassors or bannerets, of the diocese of Coutances, in the Lower Normandy: the castle of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was their honourable seat: his father <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> was conspicuous in the court and army of the duke; and his military service was furnished by <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> soldiers or knights.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> marriages, of a rank not unworthy of his own, made him the father of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> sons, who were educated at home by the impartial tenderness of his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife.
 But a narrow patrimony was insufficient for this numerous and daring progeny; they saw around the neighbourhood the mischiefs of poverty and discord, and resolved to seek in foreign wars a more glorious inheritance.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> only remained to perpetuate the race, and cherish their father's age: their <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> brothers, as they successfully attained the vigour of manhood, departed from the castle, passed the Alps, and joined the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> camp of the Normans.
 The elder were prompted by native spirit; their success encouraged their younger brethren, and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> in seniority, William, Drogo, and Humphrey, deserved to be the chiefs of their nation and the founders of the new republic.
 <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was the eldest of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> sons of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> marriage; and even the reluctant praise of his foes has endowed him with the heroic qualities of a soldier and a statesman.
 His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army: his limbs were cast in the true proportion of strength and gracefulness; and to the decline of life, he maintained the patient vigour of health and the commanding dignity of his form.
 His complexion was ruddy, his shoulders were broad, his hair and beard were long and of a flaxen colour, his eyes sparkled with fire, and his voice, like that of Achilles, could impress obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle.
 In the ruder ages of chivalry, such qualifications are not below the notice of the poet or historians: they may observe that Robert, at once, and with equal dexterity, could wield in the right hand his sword, his lance in the left; that in the battle of <PERSON>Civitella</PERSON> he was thrice unhorsed; and that in the close of that memorable day he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valour from the warriors of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies.
 (41) His boundless ambition was founded on the consciousness of superior worth: in the pursuit of greatness, he was never arrested by the scruples of justice, and seldom moved by the feelings of humanity: though not insensible of fame, the choice of open or clandestine means was determined only by his present advantage.
 The surname of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> (42) was applied to this master of political wisdom, which is too often confounded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> is praised by the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> poet for excelling the cunning of <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> and the eloquence of Cicero.
 Yet these arts were disguised by an appearance of military frankness: in his highest fortune, he was accessible and courteous to his fellow-soldiers; and while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects, he affected in his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion of his country.
 He grasped with a rapacious, that he might distribute with a liberal, hand: his primitive indigence had taught the habits of frugality; the gain of a merchant was not below his attention; and his prisoners were tortured with slow and unfeeling cruelty, to force a discovery of their secret treasure.
 According to the Greeks, he departed from <GPE>Normandy</GPE> with only <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> followers on horseback and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> on foot; yet even this allowance appears too bountiful: the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> as a pilgrim; and his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> military band was levied among the adventurers of Italy.
 His brothers and countrymen had divided the fertile lands of Apulia; but they guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice; the aspiring youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria, and in his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploits against the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the natives, it is not easy to discriminate the hero from the robber.
 To surprise a castle or a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to plunder the adjacent villages for necessary food, were the obscure labours which formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body.
 The volunteers of <GPE>Normandy</GPE> adhered to his standard; and, under his command, the peasants of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> assumed the name and character of Normans.
 His ambition and success, A.
D.
 1054-1080.
 As the genius of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> expanded with his fortune, he awakened the jealousy of his elder brother, by whom, in a transient quarrel, his life was threatened and his liberty restrained.
 After the death of Humphrey, the tender age of his sons excluded them from the command; they were reduced to a private estate, by the ambition of their guardian and uncle; and <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was exalted on a buckler, and saluted count of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and general of the republic.
 With an increase of authority and of force, he resumed the conquest of Calabria, and soon aspired to a rank that should raise him forever above the heads of his equals.
 By some acts of rapine or sacrilege, he had incurred a papal excommunication; but <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> was easily persuaded that the divisions of friends could terminate only in their mutual prejudice; that the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were the faithful champions of the Holy See; and it was safer to trust the alliance of a prince than the caprice of an aristocracy.
 A synod of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred bishops was convened at Melphi; and the count interrupted an important enterprise to guard the person and execute the decrees of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 His gratitude and policy conferred on <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and his posterity the ducal title, (43) with the investiture of Apulia, Calabria, and all the lands, both in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, which his sword could rescue from the schismatic <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the unbelieving Saracens.
 (44) This apostolic sanction might justify his arms; but the obedience of a free and victorious people could not be transferred without their consent; and <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> dissembled his elevation till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by the conquest of <PERSON>Consenza</PERSON> and Reggio.
 In the hour of triumph, he assembled his troops, and solicited the <NORP>Normans</NORP> to confirm by their suffrage the judgment of the vicar of Christ: Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1060.
 the soldiers hailed with joyful acclamations their valiant duke; and the counts, his former equals, pronounced the oath of fidelity with hollow smiles and secret indignation.
 After this inauguration, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> styled himself, "By the grace of God and St.
 Peter, duke of Apulia, Calabria, and hereafter of Sicily;" and it was the labour of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> to deserve and realize these lofty appellations.
 Such tardy progress, in a narrow space, may seem unworthy of the abilities of the chief and the spirit of the nation; but the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were few in number; their resources were scanty; their service was voluntary and precarious.
 The bravest designs of the duke were sometimes opposed by the free voice of his parliament of barons: the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> counts of popular election conspired against his authority; and against their perfidious uncle, the sons of <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> demanded justice and revenge.
 By his policy and vigour, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> discovered their plots, suppressed their rebellions, and punished the guilty with death or exile: but in these domestic feuds, his years, and the national strength, were unprofitably consumed.
 After the defeat of his foreign enemies, the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, their broken forces retreated to the strong and populous cities of the sea-coast.
 They excelled in the arts of fortification and defence; the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were accustomed to serve on horseback in the field, and their rude attempts could only succeed by the efforts of persevering courage.
 The resistance of <GPE>Salerno</GPE> was maintained above eight months; the siege or blockade of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> lasted near <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years.
 In these actions the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke was the foremost in every danger; in every fatigue the last and most patient.
 As he pressed the citadel of Salerno, a huge stone from the rampart shattered <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his military engines; and by a splinter he was wounded in the breast.
 Before the gates of Bari, he lodged in a miserable hut or barrack, composed of dry branches, and thatched with straw; a perilous station, on all sides open to the inclemency of the <DATE>winter</DATE> and the spears of the enemy.
 (45) His <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> correspond with the limits of the present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his arms have not been dissevered by the revolutions of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred years.
 (46) The monarchy has been composed of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> provinces of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> and Apulia, of the <GPE>Lombard</GPE> principality of Salerno, the republic of Amalphi, and the inland dependencies of the large and ancient duchy of Beneventum.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> districts only were exempted from the common law of subjection; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> forever, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> last till the middle of the succeeding century.
 The city and immediate territory of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> had been transferred, by gift or exchange, from the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; and although this holy land was sometimes invaded, the name of St.
 Peter was finally more potent than the sword of the Normans.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> colony of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> subdued and held the state of Capua; and her princes were reduced to beg their bread before the palace of their fathers.
 The dukes of Naples, the present metropolis, maintained the popular freedom, under the shadow of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 Among the new acquisitions of Guiscard, the science of Salerno, (47) and the trade of Amalphi, (48) may detain for a moment the curiosity of the reader.
 School of Salerno.
 I.
 Of the learned faculties, jurisprudence implies the previous establishment of laws and property; and theology may perhaps be superseded by the full light of religion and reason.
 But the savage and the sage must alike implore the assistance of physic; and, if our diseases are inflamed by luxury, the mischiefs of blows and wounds would be more frequent in the ruder ages of society.
 The treasures of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> medicine had been communicated to the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> colonies of Africa, Spain, and Sicily; and in the intercourse of peace and war, a spark of knowledge had been kindled and cherished at Salerno, an illustrious city, in which the men were honest and the women beautiful.
 (49) A school, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> that arose in the darkness of Europe, was consecrated to the healing art: the conscience of monks and bishops was reconciled to that salutary and lucrative profession; and a crowd of patients, of the most eminent rank, and most distant climates, invited or visited the physicians of Salerno.
 They were protected by the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquerors; and Guiscard, though bred in arms, could discern the merit and value of a philosopher.
 After a pilgrimage of thirty-nine years, Constantine, an <NORP>African</NORP> Christian, returned from Bagdad, a master of the language and learning of the Arabians; and <GPE>Salerno</GPE> was enriched by the practice, the lessons, and the writings of the pupil of Avicenna.
 The school of medicine has long slept in the name of a university; but her precepts are abridged in a string of aphorisms, bound together in the <NORP>Leonine</NORP> verses, or <NORP>Latin</NORP> rhymes, of the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> century.
 (50) Trade of Amalphi.
 II.
 Seven miles to the west of Salerno, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> to the south of Naples, the obscure town of <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> displayed the power and rewards of industry.
 The land, however fertile, was of narrow extent; but the sea was accessible and open: the inhabitants <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assumed the office of supplying the western world with the manufactures and productions of the East; and this useful traffic was the source of their opulence and freedom.
 The government was popular, under the administration of a duke and the supremacy of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 Fifty thousand citizens were numbered in the walls of Amalphi; nor was any city more abundantly provided with gold, silver, and the objects of precious luxury.
 The mariners who swarmed in her port, excelled in the theory and practice of navigation and astronomy: and the discovery of the compass, which has opened the globe, is owing to their ingenuity or good fortune.
 Their trade was extended to the coasts, or at least to the commodities, of Africa, Arabia, and India: and their settlements in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, acquired the privileges of independent colonies.
 (51) After <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <DATE>years</DATE> of prosperity, <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> was oppressed by the arms of the Normans, and sacked by the jealousy of Pisa; but the poverty of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand fisherman is yet dignified by the remains of an arsenal, a cathedral, and the palaces of royal merchants.
 Conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by count Roger, A.
D.
 1060-1090.
 Roger, the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> and last of the sons of Tancred, had been long detained in <GPE>Normandy</GPE> by his own and his father' age.
 He accepted the welcome summons; hastened to the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> camp; and deserved at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> the esteem, and afterwards the envy, of his elder brother.
 Their valour and ambition were equal; but the youth, the beauty, the elegant manners, of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> engaged the disinterested love of the soldiers and people.
 So scanty was his allowance for himself and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> followers, that he descended from conquest to robbery, and from robbery to domestic theft; and so loose were the notions of property, that, by his own historian, at his special command, he is accused of stealing horses from a stable at Melphi.
 (52) His spirit emerged from poverty and disgrace: from these base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy war; and the invasion of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was seconded by the zeal and policy of his brother Guiscard.
 After the retreat of the Greeks, the idolaters, a most audacious reproach of the Catholics, had retrieved their losses and possessions; but the deliverance of the island, so vainly undertaken by the forces of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, was achieved by a small and private band of adventurers.
 (53) In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attempt, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> braved, in an open boat, the real and fabulous dangers of <PRODUCT>Scylla</PRODUCT> and Charybdis; landed with only sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; drove the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> to the gates of <GPE>Messina</GPE> and safely returned with the spoils of the adjacent country.
 In the fortress of Trani, his active and patient courage were equally conspicuous.
 In his old age he related with pleasure, that, by the distress of the siege, himself, and the countess his wife, had been reduced to a single cloak or mantle, which they wore alternately; that in a sally his horse had been slain, and he was dragged away by the Saracens; but that he owed his rescue to his good sword, and had retreated with his saddle on his back, lest the meanest trophy might be left in the hands of the miscreants.
 In the siege of Trani, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Normans</NORP> withstood and repulsed the forces of the island.
 In the field of Ceramio, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand horse and foot were overthrown by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> soldiers, without reckoning St.
 George, who fought on horseback in the foremost ranks.
 The captive banners, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> camels, were reserved for the successor of St.
 Peter; and had these barbaric spoils been exposed, not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol, they might have revived the memory of the <NORP>Punic</NORP> triumphs.
 These insufficient numbers of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> most probably denote their knights, the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank, each of whom was attended by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> followers in the field; (54) yet, with the aid of this interpretation, and after every fair allowance on the side of valour, arms, and reputation, the discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce the prudent reader to the alternative of a miracle or a fable.
 The <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> derived a frequent and powerful succour from their countrymen of Africa: in the siege of Palermo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry was assisted by the galleys of Pisa; and, in the hour of action, the envy of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers was sublimed to a generous and invincible emulation.
 After a war of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, (55) Roger, with the title of great count, obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most fruitful island of the Mediterranean; and his administration displays a liberal and enlightened mind, above the limits of his age and education.
 The <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were maintained in the free enjoyment of their religion and property: (56) a philosopher and physician of Mazara, of the race of Mahomet, harangued the conqueror, and was invited to court; his geography of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> climates was translated into Latin; and Roger, after a diligent perusal, preferred the work of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> to the writings of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> Ptolemy.
 (57) A remnant of <NORP>Christian</NORP> natives had promoted the success of the Normans: they were rewarded by the triumph of the cross.
 The island was restored to the jurisdiction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; new bishops were planted in the principal cities; and the clergy was satisfied by a liberal endowment of churches and monasteries.
 Yet the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> hero asserted the rights of the civil magistrate.
 Instead of resigning the investiture of benefices, he dexterously applied to his own profit the papal claims: the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged, by the singular bull, which declares the princes of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> hereditary and perpetual legates of the Holy See.
 (58) <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> invades the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1081.
 To <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was more glorious than beneficial: the possession of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> was inadequate to his ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> occasion of invading, perhaps of subduing, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire of the East.
 (59) From his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife, the partner of his humble fortune, he had been divorced under the pretence of consanguinity; and her son <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was destined to imitate, rather than to succeed, his illustrious father.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger; their <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> daughters were given in honorable nuptials, (60) and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of them was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a beautiful youth, the son and heir of the emperor Michael.
 (61) But the throne of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was shaken by a revolution: the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> family of <PERSON>Ducas</PERSON> was confined to the palace or the cloister; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> deplored, and resented, the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally.
 A Greek, who styled himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared at Salerno, and related the adventures of his fall and flight.
 That unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the pomp and titles of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity: in his triumphal progress through <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> (62) was saluted with the tears and acclamations of the people; and Pope <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> exhorted the bishops to preach, and the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> to fight, in the pious work of his restoration.
 His conversations with <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> were frequent and familiar; and their mutual promises were justified by the valour of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and the treasures of the East.
 Yet this Michael, by the confession of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, was a pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled from his convent, or a domestic who had served in the palace.
 The fraud had been contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after this pretender had given a decent colour to his arms, he would sink, at the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity.
 But victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks; and the ardour of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> was much inferior to their credulity: the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> veterans wished to enjoy the harvest of their toils, and the unwarlike <NORP>Italians</NORP> trembled at the known and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition.
 In his new levies, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> exerted the influence of gifts and promises, the terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some acts of violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy were pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting prince.
 After <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years' incessant preparations the land and naval forces were assembled at Otranto, at the heel, or extreme promontory, of Italy; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was accompanied by his wife, who fought by his side, his son Bohemond, and the representative of the emperor Michael.
 Thirteen hundred knights (63) of <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> race or discipline, formed the sinews of the army, which might be swelled to <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand (64) followers of every denomination.
 The men, the horses, the arms, the engines, the wooden towers, covered with raw hides, were embarked on board <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> vessels: the transports had been built in the ports of Italy, and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the republic of Ragusa.
 Siege of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, June 17.
 At the mouth of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf, the shores of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Epirus</LOC> incline towards each other.
 The space between <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> and Durazzo, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> passage, is no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles; (65) at the last station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; (66) and this narrow distance had suggested to <PERSON>Pyrrhus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> the sublime or extravagant idea of a bridge.
 Before the general embarkation, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke despatched <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> with <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> galleys to seize or threaten the Isle of Corfu, to survey the opposite coast, and to secure a harbour in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Vallona</GPE> for the landing of the troops.
 They passed and landed without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks.
 The islands of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> and the maritime towns were subdued by the arms or the name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> (I use the modern appellation) to the siege of Durazzo.
 That city, the western key of the empire, was guarded by ancient renown, and recent fortifications, by <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, a patrician, victorious in the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> wars, and a numerous garrison of <NORP>Albanians</NORP> and Macedonians, who, in every age, have maintained the character of soldiers.
 In the prosecution of his enterprise, the courage of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was assailed by every form of danger and mischance.
 In the most propitious season of the year, as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow unexpectedly arose: the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was swelled by the raging blast of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the <NORP>Acroceraunian</NORP> rocks.
 (67) The sails, the masts, and the oars, were shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were covered with the fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged.
 The ducal galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> halted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of his loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had explored the ocean from <LOC>Greenland</LOC> to Mount Atlas, and who smiled at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean.
 They had wept during the tempest; they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians, who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> day's action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, (68) who led the naval powers of his father.
 All night the galleys of the republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions, the station of their archers, the weight of their javelins, and the borrowed aid of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire.
 The <NORP>Apulian</NORP> and <NORP>Ragusian</NORP> vessels fled to the shore, several were cut from their cables, and dragged away by the conqueror; and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke.
 A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo, and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and provision.
 That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease; <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred knights perished by an inglorious death; and the list of burials (if all could obtain a decent burial) amounted to <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand persons.
 Under these calamities, the mind of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> alone was firm and invincible; and while he collected new forces from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Sicily, he battered, or scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo.
 But his industry and valour were encountered by equal valour and more perfect industry.
 A movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers, had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart: but the descent of the door or drawbridge was checked by an enormous beam, and the wooden structure was constantly consumed by artificial flames.
 The army and the march of the emperor Alexius, April-September.
 While the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was attacked by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in the East, east, and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the West, the aged successor of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the founder of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasty.
 The princess Anne, his daughter and historian, observes, in her affected style, that even <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> was unequal to a double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a hasty peace with the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo.
 On his accession, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> found the camp without soldiers, and the treasury without money; yet such were the vigour and activity of his measures, that in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months he assembled an army of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand men, (69) and performed a march of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 His troops were levied in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, from <LOC>Peloponnesus</LOC> to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse-guards; and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes, some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed with the purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of affluence and dignity.
 Their youthful ardour might animate the multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their importunate clamours for speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded and starved the besieging army.
 The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world: the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the garrisons of Anatolia, or <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, had been purchased by the evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks.
 The strength of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> army consisted in the Varangians, the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule.
 Under the yoke of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conqueror, the <NORP>Danes</NORP> and <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> were oppressed and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long pilgrimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and revenge.
 They were entertained in the service of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> station was in a new city on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore: but <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valour.
 (70) The name of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in <LOC>Epirus</LOC> the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings.
 The <NORP>Varangians</NORP> were supported by some companies of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> or Latins; and the rebels, who had fled to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> from the tyranny of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their revenge.
 In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the impure aid of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> or <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valour.
 (71) The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> horse were opposed to the lances of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry.
 On the report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> assembled a council of his principal officers.
 "You behold," said he, "your danger: it is urgent and inevitable.
 The hills are covered with arms and standards; and the emperor of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> is accustomed to wars and triumphs.
 Obedience and union are our only safety; and I am ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader.
" The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke thus continued: "Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and deprive cowardice of the means of escape.
 Let us burn our vessels and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the place of our nativity and our burial.
" The resolution was unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his lines, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of the enemy.
 His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious, perhaps, that on the same ground <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had formerly disputed the empire of the world.
 (72) Battle of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, <DATE>October</DATE> 18.
 Against the advice of his wisest captains, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> resolved to risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town.
 He marched in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns to surprise the <NORP>Normans</NORP> before daybreak on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the archers formed the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line; and the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> claimed the honours of the vanguard.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 The <NORP>Lombards</NORP> and <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the garrison, and the coast was lined with the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys, who played their engines among the disorderly throng.
 On the verge of ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.
 Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as a warlike Amazon, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> goddess: (73) though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops.
 (74) Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: "Whither," he cried aloud, "whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and death is less grievous than servitude.
" The moment was decisive: as the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry.
 (75) <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune.
 The princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance, which had shivered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> helmet.
 His desperate valour broke through a squadron of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who opposed his flight; and after wandering <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus.
 The victorious <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp, and the glory of defeating an army <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times more numerous than his own.
 A multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> had been the victims of their own fears; but only <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> of his knights were slain in this memorable day.
 In the <NORP>Roman</NORP> host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and English, amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand: (76) the plain of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was more honorable than his life.
 <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> taken, A.
D.
 1082, February 8.
 It is more than probable that <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks.
 After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo; and a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> commander supplied the place of <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
 The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy.
 (77) Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage.
 At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the walls; the light <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ascended in silence; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror.
 Yet they defended the streets <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days against an enemy already master of the rampart; and near <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months elapsed between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> investment and the final surrender of the place.
 From Durazzo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke advanced into the heart of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> or Albania; traversed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mountains of Thessaly; surprised <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> tremble.
 A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs.
 By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> king of Germany.
 Return of Robert, and the actions of Bohemond.
 Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> counts, exhorting <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the authority of their leader.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of his father; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> destroyers are compared, by the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former.
 (78) After winning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, (79) which contained the treasure and magazines of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp.
 Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times.
 In the poverty of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the desertion of the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers were exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been taught by experience, that the formidable cavalry of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of motion; (80) his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Larissa</GPE> the events of war were protracted and balanced.
 The courage of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was always conspicuous, and often successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the advantage, rather than the honour, of victory.
 After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> III invited by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1081.
 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.
 (84) But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people adhered to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; Besieges Rome, A.
D.
 1081-1084.
 and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany.
 In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war.
 The gates, the bridges, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> hostages, were delivered into his hands: A.
D.
 1081-1084, March 21.
 the anti-pope, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: March 24.
 the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; March 31.
 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.
D.
 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

D.
 1166, <DATE>May</DATE> 7.
 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 16.
 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.
 Final extinction of the Normans, A.
D.
 1204.
 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The EAST » « Fall In The WEST » « Decline & Fall » His ambition and success, A.
D.
 1054-1080.
 As the genius of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> expanded with his fortune, he awakened the jealousy of his elder brother, by whom, in a transient quarrel, his life was threatened and his liberty restrained.
 After the death of Humphrey, the tender age of his sons excluded them from the command; they were reduced to a private estate, by the ambition of their guardian and uncle; and <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was exalted on a buckler, and saluted count of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and general of the republic.
 With an increase of authority and of force, he resumed the conquest of Calabria, and soon aspired to a rank that should raise him forever above the heads of his equals.
 By some acts of rapine or sacrilege, he had incurred a papal excommunication; but <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> was easily persuaded that the divisions of friends could terminate only in their mutual prejudice; that the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were the faithful champions of the Holy See; and it was safer to trust the alliance of a prince than the caprice of an aristocracy.
 A synod of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred bishops was convened at Melphi; and the count interrupted an important enterprise to guard the person and execute the decrees of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 His gratitude and policy conferred on <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and his posterity the ducal title, (43) with the investiture of Apulia, Calabria, and all the lands, both in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, which his sword could rescue from the schismatic <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the unbelieving Saracens.
 (44) This apostolic sanction might justify his arms; but the obedience of a free and victorious people could not be transferred without their consent; and <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> dissembled his elevation till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by the conquest of <PERSON>Consenza</PERSON> and Reggio.
 In the hour of triumph, he assembled his troops, and solicited the <NORP>Normans</NORP> to confirm by their suffrage the judgment of the vicar of Christ: Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1060.
 the soldiers hailed with joyful acclamations their valiant duke; and the counts, his former equals, pronounced the oath of fidelity with hollow smiles and secret indignation.
 After this inauguration, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> styled himself, "By the grace of God and St.
 Peter, duke of Apulia, Calabria, and hereafter of Sicily;" and it was the labour of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> to deserve and realize these lofty appellations.
 Such tardy progress, in a narrow space, may seem unworthy of the abilities of the chief and the spirit of the nation; but the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were few in number; their resources were scanty; their service was voluntary and precarious.
 The bravest designs of the duke were sometimes opposed by the free voice of his parliament of barons: the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> counts of popular election conspired against his authority; and against their perfidious uncle, the sons of <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> demanded justice and revenge.
 By his policy and vigour, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> discovered their plots, suppressed their rebellions, and punished the guilty with death or exile: but in these domestic feuds, his years, and the national strength, were unprofitably consumed.
 After the defeat of his foreign enemies, the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, their broken forces retreated to the strong and populous cities of the sea-coast.
 They excelled in the arts of fortification and defence; the <NORP>Normans</NORP> were accustomed to serve on horseback in the field, and their rude attempts could only succeed by the efforts of persevering courage.
 The resistance of <GPE>Salerno</GPE> was maintained above eight months; the siege or blockade of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> lasted near <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years.
 In these actions the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke was the foremost in every danger; in every fatigue the last and most patient.
 As he pressed the citadel of Salerno, a huge stone from the rampart shattered <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his military engines; and by a splinter he was wounded in the breast.
 Before the gates of Bari, he lodged in a miserable hut or barrack, composed of dry branches, and thatched with straw; a perilous station, on all sides open to the inclemency of the <DATE>winter</DATE> and the spears of the enemy.
 (45) His <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> correspond with the limits of the present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his arms have not been dissevered by the revolutions of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred years.
 (46) The monarchy has been composed of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> provinces of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> and Apulia, of the <GPE>Lombard</GPE> principality of Salerno, the republic of Amalphi, and the inland dependencies of the large and ancient duchy of Beneventum.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> districts only were exempted from the common law of subjection; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> forever, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> last till the middle of the succeeding century.
 The city and immediate territory of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> had been transferred, by gift or exchange, from the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; and although this holy land was sometimes invaded, the name of St.
 Peter was finally more potent than the sword of the Normans.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> colony of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> subdued and held the state of Capua; and her princes were reduced to beg their bread before the palace of their fathers.
 The dukes of Naples, the present metropolis, maintained the popular freedom, under the shadow of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 Among the new acquisitions of Guiscard, the science of Salerno, (47) and the trade of Amalphi, (48) may detain for a moment the curiosity of the reader.
 School of Salerno.
 I.
 Of the learned faculties, jurisprudence implies the previous establishment of laws and property; and theology may perhaps be superseded by the full light of religion and reason.
 But the savage and the sage must alike implore the assistance of physic; and, if our diseases are inflamed by luxury, the mischiefs of blows and wounds would be more frequent in the ruder ages of society.
 The treasures of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> medicine had been communicated to the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> colonies of Africa, Spain, and Sicily; and in the intercourse of peace and war, a spark of knowledge had been kindled and cherished at Salerno, an illustrious city, in which the men were honest and the women beautiful.
 (49) A school, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> that arose in the darkness of Europe, was consecrated to the healing art: the conscience of monks and bishops was reconciled to that salutary and lucrative profession; and a crowd of patients, of the most eminent rank, and most distant climates, invited or visited the physicians of Salerno.
 They were protected by the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquerors; and Guiscard, though bred in arms, could discern the merit and value of a philosopher.
 After a pilgrimage of thirty-nine years, Constantine, an <NORP>African</NORP> Christian, returned from Bagdad, a master of the language and learning of the Arabians; and <GPE>Salerno</GPE> was enriched by the practice, the lessons, and the writings of the pupil of Avicenna.
 The school of medicine has long slept in the name of a university; but her precepts are abridged in a string of aphorisms, bound together in the <NORP>Leonine</NORP> verses, or <NORP>Latin</NORP> rhymes, of the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> century.
 (50) Trade of Amalphi.
 II.
 Seven miles to the west of Salerno, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> to the south of Naples, the obscure town of <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> displayed the power and rewards of industry.
 The land, however fertile, was of narrow extent; but the sea was accessible and open: the inhabitants <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assumed the office of supplying the western world with the manufactures and productions of the East; and this useful traffic was the source of their opulence and freedom.
 The government was popular, under the administration of a duke and the supremacy of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 Fifty thousand citizens were numbered in the walls of Amalphi; nor was any city more abundantly provided with gold, silver, and the objects of precious luxury.
 The mariners who swarmed in her port, excelled in the theory and practice of navigation and astronomy: and the discovery of the compass, which has opened the globe, is owing to their ingenuity or good fortune.
 Their trade was extended to the coasts, or at least to the commodities, of Africa, Arabia, and India: and their settlements in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, acquired the privileges of independent colonies.
 (51) After <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <DATE>years</DATE> of prosperity, <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> was oppressed by the arms of the Normans, and sacked by the jealousy of Pisa; but the poverty of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand fisherman is yet dignified by the remains of an arsenal, a cathedral, and the palaces of royal merchants.
 Conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by count Roger, A.
D.
 1060-1090.
 Roger, the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> and last of the sons of Tancred, had been long detained in <GPE>Normandy</GPE> by his own and his father' age.
 He accepted the welcome summons; hastened to the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> camp; and deserved at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> the esteem, and afterwards the envy, of his elder brother.
 Their valour and ambition were equal; but the youth, the beauty, the elegant manners, of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> engaged the disinterested love of the soldiers and people.
 So scanty was his allowance for himself and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> followers, that he descended from conquest to robbery, and from robbery to domestic theft; and so loose were the notions of property, that, by his own historian, at his special command, he is accused of stealing horses from a stable at Melphi.
 (52) His spirit emerged from poverty and disgrace: from these base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy war; and the invasion of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was seconded by the zeal and policy of his brother Guiscard.
 After the retreat of the Greeks, the idolaters, a most audacious reproach of the Catholics, had retrieved their losses and possessions; but the deliverance of the island, so vainly undertaken by the forces of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, was achieved by a small and private band of adventurers.
 (53) In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attempt, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> braved, in an open boat, the real and fabulous dangers of <PRODUCT>Scylla</PRODUCT> and Charybdis; landed with only sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; drove the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> to the gates of <GPE>Messina</GPE> and safely returned with the spoils of the adjacent country.
 In the fortress of Trani, his active and patient courage were equally conspicuous.
 In his old age he related with pleasure, that, by the distress of the siege, himself, and the countess his wife, had been reduced to a single cloak or mantle, which they wore alternately; that in a sally his horse had been slain, and he was dragged away by the Saracens; but that he owed his rescue to his good sword, and had retreated with his saddle on his back, lest the meanest trophy might be left in the hands of the miscreants.
 In the siege of Trani, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Normans</NORP> withstood and repulsed the forces of the island.
 In the field of Ceramio, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand horse and foot were overthrown by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> soldiers, without reckoning St.
 George, who fought on horseback in the foremost ranks.
 The captive banners, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> camels, were reserved for the successor of St.
 Peter; and had these barbaric spoils been exposed, not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol, they might have revived the memory of the <NORP>Punic</NORP> triumphs.
 These insufficient numbers of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> most probably denote their knights, the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank, each of whom was attended by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> followers in the field; (54) yet, with the aid of this interpretation, and after every fair allowance on the side of valour, arms, and reputation, the discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce the prudent reader to the alternative of a miracle or a fable.
 The <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> derived a frequent and powerful succour from their countrymen of Africa: in the siege of Palermo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry was assisted by the galleys of Pisa; and, in the hour of action, the envy of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers was sublimed to a generous and invincible emulation.
 After a war of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, (55) Roger, with the title of great count, obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most fruitful island of the Mediterranean; and his administration displays a liberal and enlightened mind, above the limits of his age and education.
 The <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were maintained in the free enjoyment of their religion and property: (56) a philosopher and physician of Mazara, of the race of Mahomet, harangued the conqueror, and was invited to court; his geography of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> climates was translated into Latin; and Roger, after a diligent perusal, preferred the work of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> to the writings of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> Ptolemy.
 (57) A remnant of <NORP>Christian</NORP> natives had promoted the success of the Normans: they were rewarded by the triumph of the cross.
 The island was restored to the jurisdiction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; new bishops were planted in the principal cities; and the clergy was satisfied by a liberal endowment of churches and monasteries.
 Yet the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> hero asserted the rights of the civil magistrate.
 Instead of resigning the investiture of benefices, he dexterously applied to his own profit the papal claims: the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged, by the singular bull, which declares the princes of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> hereditary and perpetual legates of the Holy See.
 (58) <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> invades the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1081.
 To <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was more glorious than beneficial: the possession of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> was inadequate to his ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> occasion of invading, perhaps of subduing, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire of the East.
 (59) From his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife, the partner of his humble fortune, he had been divorced under the pretence of consanguinity; and her son <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was destined to imitate, rather than to succeed, his illustrious father.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger; their <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> daughters were given in honorable nuptials, (60) and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of them was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a beautiful youth, the son and heir of the emperor Michael.
 (61) But the throne of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was shaken by a revolution: the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> family of <PERSON>Ducas</PERSON> was confined to the palace or the cloister; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> deplored, and resented, the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally.
 A Greek, who styled himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared at Salerno, and related the adventures of his fall and flight.
 That unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the pomp and titles of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity: in his triumphal progress through <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> (62) was saluted with the tears and acclamations of the people; and Pope <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> exhorted the bishops to preach, and the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> to fight, in the pious work of his restoration.
 His conversations with <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> were frequent and familiar; and their mutual promises were justified by the valour of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and the treasures of the East.
 Yet this Michael, by the confession of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, was a pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled from his convent, or a domestic who had served in the palace.
 The fraud had been contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after this pretender had given a decent colour to his arms, he would sink, at the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity.
 But victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks; and the ardour of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> was much inferior to their credulity: the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> veterans wished to enjoy the harvest of their toils, and the unwarlike <NORP>Italians</NORP> trembled at the known and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition.
 In his new levies, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> exerted the influence of gifts and promises, the terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some acts of violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy were pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting prince.
 After <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years' incessant preparations the land and naval forces were assembled at Otranto, at the heel, or extreme promontory, of Italy; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was accompanied by his wife, who fought by his side, his son Bohemond, and the representative of the emperor Michael.
 Thirteen hundred knights (63) of <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> race or discipline, formed the sinews of the army, which might be swelled to <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand (64) followers of every denomination.
 The men, the horses, the arms, the engines, the wooden towers, covered with raw hides, were embarked on board <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> vessels: the transports had been built in the ports of Italy, and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the republic of Ragusa.
 Siege of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, June 17.
 At the mouth of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf, the shores of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Epirus</LOC> incline towards each other.
 The space between <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> and Durazzo, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> passage, is no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles; (65) at the last station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; (66) and this narrow distance had suggested to <PERSON>Pyrrhus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> the sublime or extravagant idea of a bridge.
 Before the general embarkation, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke despatched <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> with <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> galleys to seize or threaten the Isle of Corfu, to survey the opposite coast, and to secure a harbour in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Vallona</GPE> for the landing of the troops.
 They passed and landed without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks.
 The islands of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> and the maritime towns were subdued by the arms or the name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> (I use the modern appellation) to the siege of Durazzo.
 That city, the western key of the empire, was guarded by ancient renown, and recent fortifications, by <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, a patrician, victorious in the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> wars, and a numerous garrison of <NORP>Albanians</NORP> and Macedonians, who, in every age, have maintained the character of soldiers.
 In the prosecution of his enterprise, the courage of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was assailed by every form of danger and mischance.
 In the most propitious season of the year, as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow unexpectedly arose: the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was swelled by the raging blast of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the <NORP>Acroceraunian</NORP> rocks.
 (67) The sails, the masts, and the oars, were shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were covered with the fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged.
 The ducal galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> halted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of his loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had explored the ocean from <LOC>Greenland</LOC> to Mount Atlas, and who smiled at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean.
 They had wept during the tempest; they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians, who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> day's action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, (68) who led the naval powers of his father.
 All night the galleys of the republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions, the station of their archers, the weight of their javelins, and the borrowed aid of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire.
 The <NORP>Apulian</NORP> and <NORP>Ragusian</NORP> vessels fled to the shore, several were cut from their cables, and dragged away by the conqueror; and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke.
 A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo, and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and provision.
 That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease; <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred knights perished by an inglorious death; and the list of burials (if all could obtain a decent burial) amounted to <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand persons.
 Under these calamities, the mind of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> alone was firm and invincible; and while he collected new forces from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Sicily, he battered, or scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo.
 But his industry and valour were encountered by equal valour and more perfect industry.
 A movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers, had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart: but the descent of the door or drawbridge was checked by an enormous beam, and the wooden structure was constantly consumed by artificial flames.
 The army and the march of the emperor Alexius, April-September.
 While the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was attacked by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in the East, east, and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the West, the aged successor of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the founder of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasty.
 The princess Anne, his daughter and historian, observes, in her affected style, that even <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> was unequal to a double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a hasty peace with the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo.
 On his accession, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> found the camp without soldiers, and the treasury without money; yet such were the vigour and activity of his measures, that in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months he assembled an army of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand men, (69) and performed a march of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 His troops were levied in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, from <LOC>Peloponnesus</LOC> to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse-guards; and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes, some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed with the purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of affluence and dignity.
 Their youthful ardour might animate the multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their importunate clamours for speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded and starved the besieging army.
 The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world: the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the garrisons of Anatolia, or <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, had been purchased by the evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks.
 The strength of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> army consisted in the Varangians, the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule.
 Under the yoke of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conqueror, the <NORP>Danes</NORP> and <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> were oppressed and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long pilgrimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and revenge.
 They were entertained in the service of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> station was in a new city on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore: but <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valour.
 (70) The name of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in <LOC>Epirus</LOC> the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings.
 The <NORP>Varangians</NORP> were supported by some companies of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> or Latins; and the rebels, who had fled to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> from the tyranny of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their revenge.
 In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the impure aid of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> or <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valour.
 (71) The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> horse were opposed to the lances of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry.
 On the report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> assembled a council of his principal officers.
 "You behold," said he, "your danger: it is urgent and inevitable.
 The hills are covered with arms and standards; and the emperor of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> is accustomed to wars and triumphs.
 Obedience and union are our only safety; and I am ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader.
" The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke thus continued: "Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and deprive cowardice of the means of escape.
 Let us burn our vessels and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the place of our nativity and our burial.
" The resolution was unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his lines, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of the enemy.
 His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious, perhaps, that on the same ground <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had formerly disputed the empire of the world.
 (72) Battle of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, <DATE>October</DATE> 18.
 Against the advice of his wisest captains, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> resolved to risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town.
 He marched in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns to surprise the <NORP>Normans</NORP> before daybreak on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the archers formed the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line; and the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> claimed the honours of the vanguard.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 The <NORP>Lombards</NORP> and <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the garrison, and the coast was lined with the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys, who played their engines among the disorderly throng.
 On the verge of ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.
 Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as a warlike Amazon, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> goddess: (73) though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops.
 (74) Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: "Whither," he cried aloud, "whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and death is less grievous than servitude.
" The moment was decisive: as the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry.
 (75) <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune.
 The princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance, which had shivered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> helmet.
 His desperate valour broke through a squadron of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who opposed his flight; and after wandering <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus.
 The victorious <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp, and the glory of defeating an army <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times more numerous than his own.
 A multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> had been the victims of their own fears; but only <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> of his knights were slain in this memorable day.
 In the <NORP>Roman</NORP> host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and English, amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand: (76) the plain of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was more honorable than his life.
 <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> taken, A.
D.
 1082, February 8.
 It is more than probable that <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks.
 After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo; and a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> commander supplied the place of <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
 The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy.
 (77) Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage.
 At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the walls; the light <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ascended in silence; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror.
 Yet they defended the streets <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days against an enemy already master of the rampart; and near <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months elapsed between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> investment and the final surrender of the place.
 From Durazzo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke advanced into the heart of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> or Albania; traversed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mountains of Thessaly; surprised <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> tremble.
 A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs.
 By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> king of Germany.
 Return of Robert, and the actions of Bohemond.
 Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> counts, exhorting <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the authority of their leader.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of his father; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> destroyers are compared, by the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former.
 (78) After winning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, (79) which contained the treasure and magazines of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp.
 Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times.
 In the poverty of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the desertion of the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers were exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been taught by experience, that the formidable cavalry of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of motion; (80) his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Larissa</GPE> the events of war were protracted and balanced.
 The courage of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was always conspicuous, and often successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the advantage, rather than the honour, of victory.
 After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> III invited by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1081.
 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.
 (84) But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people adhered to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; Besieges Rome, A.
D.
 1081-1084.
 and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany.
 In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war.
 The gates, the bridges, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> hostages, were delivered into his hands: A.
D.
 1081-1084, March 21.
 the anti-pope, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: March 24.
 the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; March 31.
 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.

 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.
 Final extinction of the Normans, A.

 1204.
 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The EAST » « Fall In The WEST » « Decline & Fall » His <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> correspond with the limits of the present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his arms have not been dissevered by the revolutions of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred years.
 (46) The monarchy has been composed of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> provinces of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> and Apulia, of the <GPE>Lombard</GPE> principality of Salerno, the republic of Amalphi, and the inland dependencies of the large and ancient duchy of Beneventum.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> districts only were exempted from the common law of subjection; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> forever, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> last till the middle of the succeeding century.
 The city and immediate territory of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> had been transferred, by gift or exchange, from the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; and although this holy land was sometimes invaded, the name of St.
 Peter was finally more potent than the sword of the Normans.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> colony of <PERSON>Aversa</PERSON> subdued and held the state of Capua; and her princes were reduced to beg their bread before the palace of their fathers.
 The dukes of Naples, the present metropolis, maintained the popular freedom, under the shadow of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 Among the new acquisitions of Guiscard, the science of Salerno, (47) and the trade of Amalphi, (48) may detain for a moment the curiosity of the reader.
 School of Salerno.
 I.
 Of the learned faculties, jurisprudence implies the previous establishment of laws and property; and theology may perhaps be superseded by the full light of religion and reason.
 But the savage and the sage must alike implore the assistance of physic; and, if our diseases are inflamed by luxury, the mischiefs of blows and wounds would be more frequent in the ruder ages of society.
 The treasures of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> medicine had been communicated to the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> colonies of Africa, Spain, and Sicily; and in the intercourse of peace and war, a spark of knowledge had been kindled and cherished at Salerno, an illustrious city, in which the men were honest and the women beautiful.
 (49) A school, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> that arose in the darkness of Europe, was consecrated to the healing art: the conscience of monks and bishops was reconciled to that salutary and lucrative profession; and a crowd of patients, of the most eminent rank, and most distant climates, invited or visited the physicians of Salerno.
 They were protected by the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquerors; and Guiscard, though bred in arms, could discern the merit and value of a philosopher.
 After a pilgrimage of thirty-nine years, Constantine, an <NORP>African</NORP> Christian, returned from Bagdad, a master of the language and learning of the Arabians; and <GPE>Salerno</GPE> was enriched by the practice, the lessons, and the writings of the pupil of Avicenna.
 The school of medicine has long slept in the name of a university; but her precepts are abridged in a string of aphorisms, bound together in the <NORP>Leonine</NORP> verses, or <NORP>Latin</NORP> rhymes, of the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> century.
 (50) Trade of Amalphi.
 II.
 Seven miles to the west of Salerno, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> to the south of Naples, the obscure town of <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> displayed the power and rewards of industry.
 The land, however fertile, was of narrow extent; but the sea was accessible and open: the inhabitants <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assumed the office of supplying the western world with the manufactures and productions of the East; and this useful traffic was the source of their opulence and freedom.
 The government was popular, under the administration of a duke and the supremacy of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 Fifty thousand citizens were numbered in the walls of Amalphi; nor was any city more abundantly provided with gold, silver, and the objects of precious luxury.
 The mariners who swarmed in her port, excelled in the theory and practice of navigation and astronomy: and the discovery of the compass, which has opened the globe, is owing to their ingenuity or good fortune.
 Their trade was extended to the coasts, or at least to the commodities, of Africa, Arabia, and India: and their settlements in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, acquired the privileges of independent colonies.
 (51) After <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <DATE>years</DATE> of prosperity, <ORG>Amalphi</ORG> was oppressed by the arms of the Normans, and sacked by the jealousy of Pisa; but the poverty of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand fisherman is yet dignified by the remains of an arsenal, a cathedral, and the palaces of royal merchants.
 Conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by count Roger, A.
D.
 1060-1090.
 Roger, the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> and last of the sons of Tancred, had been long detained in <GPE>Normandy</GPE> by his own and his father' age.
 He accepted the welcome summons; hastened to the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> camp; and deserved at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> the esteem, and afterwards the envy, of his elder brother.
 Their valour and ambition were equal; but the youth, the beauty, the elegant manners, of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> engaged the disinterested love of the soldiers and people.
 So scanty was his allowance for himself and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> followers, that he descended from conquest to robbery, and from robbery to domestic theft; and so loose were the notions of property, that, by his own historian, at his special command, he is accused of stealing horses from a stable at Melphi.
 (52) His spirit emerged from poverty and disgrace: from these base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy war; and the invasion of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was seconded by the zeal and policy of his brother Guiscard.
 After the retreat of the Greeks, the idolaters, a most audacious reproach of the Catholics, had retrieved their losses and possessions; but the deliverance of the island, so vainly undertaken by the forces of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, was achieved by a small and private band of adventurers.
 (53) In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attempt, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> braved, in an open boat, the real and fabulous dangers of <PRODUCT>Scylla</PRODUCT> and Charybdis; landed with only sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; drove the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> to the gates of <GPE>Messina</GPE> and safely returned with the spoils of the adjacent country.
 In the fortress of Trani, his active and patient courage were equally conspicuous.
 In his old age he related with pleasure, that, by the distress of the siege, himself, and the countess his wife, had been reduced to a single cloak or mantle, which they wore alternately; that in a sally his horse had been slain, and he was dragged away by the Saracens; but that he owed his rescue to his good sword, and had retreated with his saddle on his back, lest the meanest trophy might be left in the hands of the miscreants.
 In the siege of Trani, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Normans</NORP> withstood and repulsed the forces of the island.
 In the field of Ceramio, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand horse and foot were overthrown by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> soldiers, without reckoning St.
 George, who fought on horseback in the foremost ranks.
 The captive banners, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> camels, were reserved for the successor of St.
 Peter; and had these barbaric spoils been exposed, not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol, they might have revived the memory of the <NORP>Punic</NORP> triumphs.
 These insufficient numbers of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> most probably denote their knights, the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank, each of whom was attended by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> followers in the field; (54) yet, with the aid of this interpretation, and after every fair allowance on the side of valour, arms, and reputation, the discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce the prudent reader to the alternative of a miracle or a fable.
 The <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> derived a frequent and powerful succour from their countrymen of Africa: in the siege of Palermo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry was assisted by the galleys of Pisa; and, in the hour of action, the envy of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers was sublimed to a generous and invincible emulation.
 After a war of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, (55) Roger, with the title of great count, obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most fruitful island of the Mediterranean; and his administration displays a liberal and enlightened mind, above the limits of his age and education.
 The <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were maintained in the free enjoyment of their religion and property: (56) a philosopher and physician of Mazara, of the race of Mahomet, harangued the conqueror, and was invited to court; his geography of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> climates was translated into Latin; and Roger, after a diligent perusal, preferred the work of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> to the writings of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> Ptolemy.
 (57) A remnant of <NORP>Christian</NORP> natives had promoted the success of the Normans: they were rewarded by the triumph of the cross.
 The island was restored to the jurisdiction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; new bishops were planted in the principal cities; and the clergy was satisfied by a liberal endowment of churches and monasteries.
 Yet the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> hero asserted the rights of the civil magistrate.
 Instead of resigning the investiture of benefices, he dexterously applied to his own profit the papal claims: the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged, by the singular bull, which declares the princes of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> hereditary and perpetual legates of the Holy See.
 (58) <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> invades the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1081.
 To <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was more glorious than beneficial: the possession of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> was inadequate to his ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> occasion of invading, perhaps of subduing, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire of the East.
 (59) From his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife, the partner of his humble fortune, he had been divorced under the pretence of consanguinity; and her son <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was destined to imitate, rather than to succeed, his illustrious father.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger; their <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> daughters were given in honorable nuptials, (60) and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of them was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a beautiful youth, the son and heir of the emperor Michael.
 (61) But the throne of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was shaken by a revolution: the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> family of <PERSON>Ducas</PERSON> was confined to the palace or the cloister; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> deplored, and resented, the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally.
 A Greek, who styled himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared at Salerno, and related the adventures of his fall and flight.
 That unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the pomp and titles of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity: in his triumphal progress through <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> (62) was saluted with the tears and acclamations of the people; and Pope <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> exhorted the bishops to preach, and the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> to fight, in the pious work of his restoration.
 His conversations with <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> were frequent and familiar; and their mutual promises were justified by the valour of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and the treasures of the East.
 Yet this Michael, by the confession of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, was a pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled from his convent, or a domestic who had served in the palace.
 The fraud had been contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after this pretender had given a decent colour to his arms, he would sink, at the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity.
 But victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks; and the ardour of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> was much inferior to their credulity: the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> veterans wished to enjoy the harvest of their toils, and the unwarlike <NORP>Italians</NORP> trembled at the known and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition.
 In his new levies, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> exerted the influence of gifts and promises, the terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some acts of violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy were pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting prince.
 After <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years' incessant preparations the land and naval forces were assembled at Otranto, at the heel, or extreme promontory, of Italy; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was accompanied by his wife, who fought by his side, his son Bohemond, and the representative of the emperor Michael.
 Thirteen hundred knights (63) of <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> race or discipline, formed the sinews of the army, which might be swelled to <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand (64) followers of every denomination.
 The men, the horses, the arms, the engines, the wooden towers, covered with raw hides, were embarked on board <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> vessels: the transports had been built in the ports of Italy, and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the republic of Ragusa.
 Siege of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, June 17.
 At the mouth of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf, the shores of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Epirus</LOC> incline towards each other.
 The space between <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> and Durazzo, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> passage, is no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles; (65) at the last station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; (66) and this narrow distance had suggested to <PERSON>Pyrrhus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> the sublime or extravagant idea of a bridge.
 Before the general embarkation, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke despatched <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> with <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> galleys to seize or threaten the Isle of Corfu, to survey the opposite coast, and to secure a harbour in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Vallona</GPE> for the landing of the troops.
 They passed and landed without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks.
 The islands of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> and the maritime towns were subdued by the arms or the name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> (I use the modern appellation) to the siege of Durazzo.
 That city, the western key of the empire, was guarded by ancient renown, and recent fortifications, by <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, a patrician, victorious in the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> wars, and a numerous garrison of <NORP>Albanians</NORP> and Macedonians, who, in every age, have maintained the character of soldiers.
 In the prosecution of his enterprise, the courage of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was assailed by every form of danger and mischance.
 In the most propitious season of the year, as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow unexpectedly arose: the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was swelled by the raging blast of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the <NORP>Acroceraunian</NORP> rocks.
 (67) The sails, the masts, and the oars, were shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were covered with the fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged.
 The ducal galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> halted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of his loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had explored the ocean from <LOC>Greenland</LOC> to Mount Atlas, and who smiled at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean.
 They had wept during the tempest; they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians, who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> day's action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, (68) who led the naval powers of his father.
 All night the galleys of the republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions, the station of their archers, the weight of their javelins, and the borrowed aid of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire.
 The <NORP>Apulian</NORP> and <NORP>Ragusian</NORP> vessels fled to the shore, several were cut from their cables, and dragged away by the conqueror; and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke.
 A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo, and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and provision.
 That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease; <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred knights perished by an inglorious death; and the list of burials (if all could obtain a decent burial) amounted to <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand persons.
 Under these calamities, the mind of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> alone was firm and invincible; and while he collected new forces from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Sicily, he battered, or scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo.
 But his industry and valour were encountered by equal valour and more perfect industry.
 A movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers, had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart: but the descent of the door or drawbridge was checked by an enormous beam, and the wooden structure was constantly consumed by artificial flames.
 The army and the march of the emperor Alexius, April-September.
 While the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was attacked by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in the East, east, and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the West, the aged successor of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the founder of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasty.
 The princess Anne, his daughter and historian, observes, in her affected style, that even <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> was unequal to a double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a hasty peace with the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo.
 On his accession, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> found the camp without soldiers, and the treasury without money; yet such were the vigour and activity of his measures, that in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months he assembled an army of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand men, (69) and performed a march of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 His troops were levied in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, from <LOC>Peloponnesus</LOC> to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse-guards; and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes, some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed with the purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of affluence and dignity.
 Their youthful ardour might animate the multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their importunate clamours for speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded and starved the besieging army.
 The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world: the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the garrisons of Anatolia, or <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, had been purchased by the evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks.
 The strength of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> army consisted in the Varangians, the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule.
 Under the yoke of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conqueror, the <NORP>Danes</NORP> and <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> were oppressed and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long pilgrimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and revenge.
 They were entertained in the service of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> station was in a new city on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore: but <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valour.
 (70) The name of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in <LOC>Epirus</LOC> the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings.
 The <NORP>Varangians</NORP> were supported by some companies of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> or Latins; and the rebels, who had fled to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> from the tyranny of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their revenge.
 In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the impure aid of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> or <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valour.
 (71) The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> horse were opposed to the lances of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry.
 On the report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> assembled a council of his principal officers.
 "You behold," said he, "your danger: it is urgent and inevitable.
 The hills are covered with arms and standards; and the emperor of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> is accustomed to wars and triumphs.
 Obedience and union are our only safety; and I am ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader.
" The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke thus continued: "Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and deprive cowardice of the means of escape.
 Let us burn our vessels and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the place of our nativity and our burial.
" The resolution was unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his lines, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of the enemy.
 His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious, perhaps, that on the same ground <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had formerly disputed the empire of the world.
 (72) Battle of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, <DATE>October</DATE> 18.
 Against the advice of his wisest captains, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> resolved to risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town.
 He marched in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns to surprise the <NORP>Normans</NORP> before daybreak on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the archers formed the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line; and the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> claimed the honours of the vanguard.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 The <NORP>Lombards</NORP> and <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the garrison, and the coast was lined with the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys, who played their engines among the disorderly throng.
 On the verge of ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.
 Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as a warlike Amazon, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> goddess: (73) though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops.
 (74) Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: "Whither," he cried aloud, "whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and death is less grievous than servitude.
" The moment was decisive: as the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry.
 (75) <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune.
 The princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance, which had shivered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> helmet.
 His desperate valour broke through a squadron of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who opposed his flight; and after wandering <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus.
 The victorious <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp, and the glory of defeating an army <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times more numerous than his own.
 A multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> had been the victims of their own fears; but only <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> of his knights were slain in this memorable day.
 In the <NORP>Roman</NORP> host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and English, amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand: (76) the plain of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was more honorable than his life.
 <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> taken, A.
D.
 1082, February 8.
 It is more than probable that <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks.
 After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo; and a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> commander supplied the place of <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
 The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy.
 (77) Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage.
 At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the walls; the light <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ascended in silence; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror.
 Yet they defended the streets <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days against an enemy already master of the rampart; and near <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months elapsed between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> investment and the final surrender of the place.
 From Durazzo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke advanced into the heart of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> or Albania; traversed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mountains of Thessaly; surprised <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> tremble.
 A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs.
 By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> king of Germany.
 Return of Robert, and the actions of Bohemond.
 Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> counts, exhorting <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the authority of their leader.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of his father; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> destroyers are compared, by the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former.
 (78) After winning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, (79) which contained the treasure and magazines of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp.
 Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times.
 In the poverty of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the desertion of the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers were exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been taught by experience, that the formidable cavalry of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of motion; (80) his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Larissa</GPE> the events of war were protracted and balanced.
 The courage of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was always conspicuous, and often successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the advantage, rather than the honour, of victory.
 After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> III invited by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1081.
 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.
 (84) But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people adhered to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; Besieges Rome, A.
D.
 1081-1084.
 and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany.
 In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war.
 The gates, the bridges, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> hostages, were delivered into his hands: A.
D.
 1081-1084, March 21.
 the anti-pope, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: March 24.
 the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; March 31.
 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.

 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.
D.
 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

D.
 1166, <DATE>May</DATE> 7.
 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.
 Final extinction of the Normans, A.
D.
 1204.
 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The EAST » « Fall In The WEST » « Decline & Fall » Conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by count Roger, A.
D.
 1060-1090.
 Roger, the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> and last of the sons of Tancred, had been long detained in <GPE>Normandy</GPE> by his own and his father' age.
 He accepted the welcome summons; hastened to the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> camp; and deserved at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> the esteem, and afterwards the envy, of his elder brother.
 Their valour and ambition were equal; but the youth, the beauty, the elegant manners, of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> engaged the disinterested love of the soldiers and people.
 So scanty was his allowance for himself and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> followers, that he descended from conquest to robbery, and from robbery to domestic theft; and so loose were the notions of property, that, by his own historian, at his special command, he is accused of stealing horses from a stable at Melphi.
 (52) His spirit emerged from poverty and disgrace: from these base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy war; and the invasion of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was seconded by the zeal and policy of his brother Guiscard.
 After the retreat of the Greeks, the idolaters, a most audacious reproach of the Catholics, had retrieved their losses and possessions; but the deliverance of the island, so vainly undertaken by the forces of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, was achieved by a small and private band of adventurers.
 (53) In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attempt, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> braved, in an open boat, the real and fabulous dangers of <PRODUCT>Scylla</PRODUCT> and Charybdis; landed with only sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; drove the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> to the gates of <GPE>Messina</GPE> and safely returned with the spoils of the adjacent country.
 In the fortress of Trani, his active and patient courage were equally conspicuous.
 In his old age he related with pleasure, that, by the distress of the siege, himself, and the countess his wife, had been reduced to a single cloak or mantle, which they wore alternately; that in a sally his horse had been slain, and he was dragged away by the Saracens; but that he owed his rescue to his good sword, and had retreated with his saddle on his back, lest the meanest trophy might be left in the hands of the miscreants.
 In the siege of Trani, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Normans</NORP> withstood and repulsed the forces of the island.
 In the field of Ceramio, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand horse and foot were overthrown by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> soldiers, without reckoning St.
 George, who fought on horseback in the foremost ranks.
 The captive banners, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> camels, were reserved for the successor of St.
 Peter; and had these barbaric spoils been exposed, not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol, they might have revived the memory of the <NORP>Punic</NORP> triumphs.
 These insufficient numbers of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> most probably denote their knights, the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank, each of whom was attended by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> followers in the field; (54) yet, with the aid of this interpretation, and after every fair allowance on the side of valour, arms, and reputation, the discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce the prudent reader to the alternative of a miracle or a fable.
 The <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> derived a frequent and powerful succour from their countrymen of Africa: in the siege of Palermo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry was assisted by the galleys of Pisa; and, in the hour of action, the envy of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers was sublimed to a generous and invincible emulation.
 After a war of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, (55) Roger, with the title of great count, obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most fruitful island of the Mediterranean; and his administration displays a liberal and enlightened mind, above the limits of his age and education.
 The <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were maintained in the free enjoyment of their religion and property: (56) a philosopher and physician of Mazara, of the race of Mahomet, harangued the conqueror, and was invited to court; his geography of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> climates was translated into Latin; and Roger, after a diligent perusal, preferred the work of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> to the writings of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> Ptolemy.
 (57) A remnant of <NORP>Christian</NORP> natives had promoted the success of the Normans: they were rewarded by the triumph of the cross.
 The island was restored to the jurisdiction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; new bishops were planted in the principal cities; and the clergy was satisfied by a liberal endowment of churches and monasteries.
 Yet the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> hero asserted the rights of the civil magistrate.
 Instead of resigning the investiture of benefices, he dexterously applied to his own profit the papal claims: the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged, by the singular bull, which declares the princes of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> hereditary and perpetual legates of the Holy See.
 (58) <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> invades the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1081.
 To <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was more glorious than beneficial: the possession of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> was inadequate to his ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> occasion of invading, perhaps of subduing, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire of the East.
 (59) From his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife, the partner of his humble fortune, he had been divorced under the pretence of consanguinity; and her son <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was destined to imitate, rather than to succeed, his illustrious father.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger; their <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> daughters were given in honorable nuptials, (60) and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of them was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a beautiful youth, the son and heir of the emperor Michael.
 (61) But the throne of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was shaken by a revolution: the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> family of <PERSON>Ducas</PERSON> was confined to the palace or the cloister; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> deplored, and resented, the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally.
 A Greek, who styled himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared at Salerno, and related the adventures of his fall and flight.
 That unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the pomp and titles of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity: in his triumphal progress through <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> (62) was saluted with the tears and acclamations of the people; and Pope <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> exhorted the bishops to preach, and the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> to fight, in the pious work of his restoration.
 His conversations with <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> were frequent and familiar; and their mutual promises were justified by the valour of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and the treasures of the East.
 Yet this Michael, by the confession of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, was a pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled from his convent, or a domestic who had served in the palace.
 The fraud had been contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after this pretender had given a decent colour to his arms, he would sink, at the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity.
 But victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks; and the ardour of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> was much inferior to their credulity: the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> veterans wished to enjoy the harvest of their toils, and the unwarlike <NORP>Italians</NORP> trembled at the known and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition.
 In his new levies, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> exerted the influence of gifts and promises, the terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some acts of violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy were pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting prince.
 After <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years' incessant preparations the land and naval forces were assembled at Otranto, at the heel, or extreme promontory, of Italy; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was accompanied by his wife, who fought by his side, his son Bohemond, and the representative of the emperor Michael.
 Thirteen hundred knights (63) of <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> race or discipline, formed the sinews of the army, which might be swelled to <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand (64) followers of every denomination.
 The men, the horses, the arms, the engines, the wooden towers, covered with raw hides, were embarked on board <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> vessels: the transports had been built in the ports of Italy, and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the republic of Ragusa.
 Siege of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, June 17.
 At the mouth of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf, the shores of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Epirus</LOC> incline towards each other.
 The space between <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> and Durazzo, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> passage, is no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles; (65) at the last station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; (66) and this narrow distance had suggested to <PERSON>Pyrrhus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> the sublime or extravagant idea of a bridge.
 Before the general embarkation, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke despatched <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> with <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> galleys to seize or threaten the Isle of Corfu, to survey the opposite coast, and to secure a harbour in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Vallona</GPE> for the landing of the troops.
 They passed and landed without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks.
 The islands of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> and the maritime towns were subdued by the arms or the name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> (I use the modern appellation) to the siege of Durazzo.
 That city, the western key of the empire, was guarded by ancient renown, and recent fortifications, by <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, a patrician, victorious in the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> wars, and a numerous garrison of <NORP>Albanians</NORP> and Macedonians, who, in every age, have maintained the character of soldiers.
 In the prosecution of his enterprise, the courage of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was assailed by every form of danger and mischance.
 In the most propitious season of the year, as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow unexpectedly arose: the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was swelled by the raging blast of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the <NORP>Acroceraunian</NORP> rocks.
 (67) The sails, the masts, and the oars, were shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were covered with the fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged.
 The ducal galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> halted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of his loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had explored the ocean from <LOC>Greenland</LOC> to Mount Atlas, and who smiled at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean.
 They had wept during the tempest; they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians, who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> day's action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, (68) who led the naval powers of his father.
 All night the galleys of the republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions, the station of their archers, the weight of their javelins, and the borrowed aid of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire.
 The <NORP>Apulian</NORP> and <NORP>Ragusian</NORP> vessels fled to the shore, several were cut from their cables, and dragged away by the conqueror; and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke.
 A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo, and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and provision.
 That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease; <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred knights perished by an inglorious death; and the list of burials (if all could obtain a decent burial) amounted to <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand persons.
 Under these calamities, the mind of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> alone was firm and invincible; and while he collected new forces from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Sicily, he battered, or scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo.
 But his industry and valour were encountered by equal valour and more perfect industry.
 A movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers, had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart: but the descent of the door or drawbridge was checked by an enormous beam, and the wooden structure was constantly consumed by artificial flames.
 The army and the march of the emperor Alexius, April-September.
 While the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was attacked by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in the East, east, and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the West, the aged successor of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the founder of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasty.
 The princess Anne, his daughter and historian, observes, in her affected style, that even <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> was unequal to a double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a hasty peace with the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo.
 On his accession, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> found the camp without soldiers, and the treasury without money; yet such were the vigour and activity of his measures, that in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months he assembled an army of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand men, (69) and performed a march of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 His troops were levied in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, from <LOC>Peloponnesus</LOC> to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse-guards; and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes, some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed with the purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of affluence and dignity.
 Their youthful ardour might animate the multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their importunate clamours for speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded and starved the besieging army.
 The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world: the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the garrisons of Anatolia, or <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, had been purchased by the evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks.
 The strength of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> army consisted in the Varangians, the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule.
 Under the yoke of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conqueror, the <NORP>Danes</NORP> and <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> were oppressed and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long pilgrimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and revenge.
 They were entertained in the service of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> station was in a new city on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore: but <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valour.
 (70) The name of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in <LOC>Epirus</LOC> the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings.
 The <NORP>Varangians</NORP> were supported by some companies of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> or Latins; and the rebels, who had fled to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> from the tyranny of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their revenge.
 In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the impure aid of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> or <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valour.
 (71) The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> horse were opposed to the lances of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry.
 On the report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> assembled a council of his principal officers.
 "You behold," said he, "your danger: it is urgent and inevitable.
 The hills are covered with arms and standards; and the emperor of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> is accustomed to wars and triumphs.
 Obedience and union are our only safety; and I am ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader.
" The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke thus continued: "Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and deprive cowardice of the means of escape.
 Let us burn our vessels and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the place of our nativity and our burial.
" The resolution was unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his lines, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of the enemy.
 His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious, perhaps, that on the same ground <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had formerly disputed the empire of the world.
 (72) Battle of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, <DATE>October</DATE> 18.
 Against the advice of his wisest captains, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> resolved to risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town.
 He marched in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns to surprise the <NORP>Normans</NORP> before daybreak on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the archers formed the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line; and the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> claimed the honours of the vanguard.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 The <NORP>Lombards</NORP> and <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the garrison, and the coast was lined with the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys, who played their engines among the disorderly throng.
 On the verge of ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.
 Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as a warlike Amazon, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> goddess: (73) though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops.
 (74) Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: "Whither," he cried aloud, "whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and death is less grievous than servitude.
" The moment was decisive: as the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry.
 (75) <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune.
 The princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance, which had shivered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> helmet.
 His desperate valour broke through a squadron of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who opposed his flight; and after wandering <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus.
 The victorious <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp, and the glory of defeating an army <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times more numerous than his own.
 A multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> had been the victims of their own fears; but only <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> of his knights were slain in this memorable day.
 In the <NORP>Roman</NORP> host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and English, amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand: (76) the plain of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was more honorable than his life.
 <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> taken, A.
D.
 1082, February 8.
 It is more than probable that <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks.
 After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo; and a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> commander supplied the place of <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
 The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy.
 (77) Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage.
 At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the walls; the light <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ascended in silence; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror.
 Yet they defended the streets <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days against an enemy already master of the rampart; and near <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months elapsed between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> investment and the final surrender of the place.
 From Durazzo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke advanced into the heart of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> or Albania; traversed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mountains of Thessaly; surprised <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> tremble.
 A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs.
 By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> king of Germany.
 Return of Robert, and the actions of Bohemond.
 Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> counts, exhorting <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the authority of their leader.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of his father; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> destroyers are compared, by the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former.
 (78) After winning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, (79) which contained the treasure and magazines of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp.
 Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times.
 In the poverty of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the desertion of the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers were exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been taught by experience, that the formidable cavalry of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of motion; (80) his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Larissa</GPE> the events of war were protracted and balanced.
 The courage of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was always conspicuous, and often successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the advantage, rather than the honour, of victory.
 After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> III invited by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1081.
 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.
 (84) But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people adhered to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; Besieges Rome, A.
D.
 1081-1084.
 and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany.
 In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war.
 The gates, the bridges, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> hostages, were delivered into his hands: A.
D.
 1081-1084, March 21.
 the anti-pope, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: March 24.
 the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; March 31.
 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.

 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.

 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.

D.
 1081.
 To <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the conquest of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was more glorious than beneficial: the possession of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> was inadequate to his ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> occasion of invading, perhaps of subduing, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire of the East.
 (59) From his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife, the partner of his humble fortune, he had been divorced under the pretence of consanguinity; and her son <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was destined to imitate, rather than to succeed, his illustrious father.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger; their <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> daughters were given in honorable nuptials, (60) and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of them was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a beautiful youth, the son and heir of the emperor Michael.
 (61) But the throne of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was shaken by a revolution: the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> family of <PERSON>Ducas</PERSON> was confined to the palace or the cloister; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> deplored, and resented, the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally.
 A Greek, who styled himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared at Salerno, and related the adventures of his fall and flight.
 That unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the pomp and titles of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity: in his triumphal progress through <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> (62) was saluted with the tears and acclamations of the people; and Pope <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> exhorted the bishops to preach, and the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> to fight, in the pious work of his restoration.
 His conversations with <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> were frequent and familiar; and their mutual promises were justified by the valour of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and the treasures of the East.
 Yet this Michael, by the confession of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, was a pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled from his convent, or a domestic who had served in the palace.
 The fraud had been contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after this pretender had given a decent colour to his arms, he would sink, at the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity.
 But victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks; and the ardour of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> was much inferior to their credulity: the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> veterans wished to enjoy the harvest of their toils, and the unwarlike <NORP>Italians</NORP> trembled at the known and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition.
 In his new levies, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> exerted the influence of gifts and promises, the terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some acts of violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy were pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting prince.
 After <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years' incessant preparations the land and naval forces were assembled at Otranto, at the heel, or extreme promontory, of Italy; and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was accompanied by his wife, who fought by his side, his son Bohemond, and the representative of the emperor Michael.
 Thirteen hundred knights (63) of <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> race or discipline, formed the sinews of the army, which might be swelled to <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand (64) followers of every denomination.
 The men, the horses, the arms, the engines, the wooden towers, covered with raw hides, were embarked on board <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> vessels: the transports had been built in the ports of Italy, and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the republic of Ragusa.
 Siege of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, June 17.
 At the mouth of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf, the shores of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Epirus</LOC> incline towards each other.
 The space between <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> and Durazzo, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> passage, is no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles; (65) at the last station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; (66) and this narrow distance had suggested to <PERSON>Pyrrhus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> the sublime or extravagant idea of a bridge.
 Before the general embarkation, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke despatched <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> with <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> galleys to seize or threaten the Isle of Corfu, to survey the opposite coast, and to secure a harbour in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Vallona</GPE> for the landing of the troops.
 They passed and landed without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks.
 The islands of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> and the maritime towns were subdued by the arms or the name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> (I use the modern appellation) to the siege of Durazzo.
 That city, the western key of the empire, was guarded by ancient renown, and recent fortifications, by <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, a patrician, victorious in the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> wars, and a numerous garrison of <NORP>Albanians</NORP> and Macedonians, who, in every age, have maintained the character of soldiers.
 In the prosecution of his enterprise, the courage of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was assailed by every form of danger and mischance.
 In the most propitious season of the year, as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow unexpectedly arose: the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was swelled by the raging blast of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the <NORP>Acroceraunian</NORP> rocks.
 (67) The sails, the masts, and the oars, were shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were covered with the fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged.
 The ducal galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> halted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of his loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had explored the ocean from <LOC>Greenland</LOC> to Mount Atlas, and who smiled at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean.
 They had wept during the tempest; they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians, who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> day's action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, (68) who led the naval powers of his father.
 All night the galleys of the republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions, the station of their archers, the weight of their javelins, and the borrowed aid of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire.
 The <NORP>Apulian</NORP> and <NORP>Ragusian</NORP> vessels fled to the shore, several were cut from their cables, and dragged away by the conqueror; and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke.
 A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo, and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and provision.
 That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease; <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred knights perished by an inglorious death; and the list of burials (if all could obtain a decent burial) amounted to <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand persons.
 Under these calamities, the mind of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> alone was firm and invincible; and while he collected new forces from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Sicily, he battered, or scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo.
 But his industry and valour were encountered by equal valour and more perfect industry.
 A movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers, had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart: but the descent of the door or drawbridge was checked by an enormous beam, and the wooden structure was constantly consumed by artificial flames.
 The army and the march of the emperor Alexius, April-September.
 While the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was attacked by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in the East, east, and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the West, the aged successor of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the founder of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasty.
 The princess Anne, his daughter and historian, observes, in her affected style, that even <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> was unequal to a double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a hasty peace with the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo.
 On his accession, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> found the camp without soldiers, and the treasury without money; yet such were the vigour and activity of his measures, that in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months he assembled an army of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand men, (69) and performed a march of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 His troops were levied in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, from <LOC>Peloponnesus</LOC> to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse-guards; and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes, some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed with the purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of affluence and dignity.
 Their youthful ardour might animate the multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their importunate clamours for speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded and starved the besieging army.
 The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world: the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the garrisons of Anatolia, or <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, had been purchased by the evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks.
 The strength of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> army consisted in the Varangians, the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule.
 Under the yoke of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conqueror, the <NORP>Danes</NORP> and <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> were oppressed and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long pilgrimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and revenge.
 They were entertained in the service of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> station was in a new city on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore: but <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valour.
 (70) The name of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in <LOC>Epirus</LOC> the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings.
 The <NORP>Varangians</NORP> were supported by some companies of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> or Latins; and the rebels, who had fled to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> from the tyranny of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their revenge.
 In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the impure aid of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> or <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valour.
 (71) The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> horse were opposed to the lances of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry.
 On the report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> assembled a council of his principal officers.
 "You behold," said he, "your danger: it is urgent and inevitable.
 The hills are covered with arms and standards; and the emperor of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> is accustomed to wars and triumphs.
 Obedience and union are our only safety; and I am ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader.
" The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke thus continued: "Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and deprive cowardice of the means of escape.
 Let us burn our vessels and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the place of our nativity and our burial.
" The resolution was unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his lines, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of the enemy.
 His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious, perhaps, that on the same ground <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had formerly disputed the empire of the world.

 Against the advice of his wisest captains, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> resolved to risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town.
 He marched in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns to surprise the <NORP>Normans</NORP> before daybreak on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the archers formed the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line; and the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> claimed the honours of the vanguard.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 The <NORP>Lombards</NORP> and <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the garrison, and the coast was lined with the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys, who played their engines among the disorderly throng.
 On the verge of ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.
 Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as a warlike Amazon, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> goddess: (73) though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops.
 (74) Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: "Whither," he cried aloud, "whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and death is less grievous than servitude.
" The moment was decisive: as the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry.
 (75) <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune.
 The princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance, which had shivered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> helmet.
 His desperate valour broke through a squadron of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who opposed his flight; and after wandering <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus.
 The victorious <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp, and the glory of defeating an army <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times more numerous than his own.
 A multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> had been the victims of their own fears; but only <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> of his knights were slain in this memorable day.
 In the <NORP>Roman</NORP> host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and English, amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand: (76) the plain of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was more honorable than his life.
 <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> taken, A.
D.
 1082, February 8.
 It is more than probable that <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks.
 After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo; and a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> commander supplied the place of <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
 The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy.
 (77) Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage.
 At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the walls; the light <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ascended in silence; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror.
 Yet they defended the streets <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days against an enemy already master of the rampart; and near <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months elapsed between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> investment and the final surrender of the place.
 From Durazzo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke advanced into the heart of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> or Albania; traversed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mountains of Thessaly; surprised <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> tremble.
 A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs.
 By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> king of Germany.
 Return of Robert, and the actions of Bohemond.
 Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> counts, exhorting <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the authority of their leader.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of his father; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> destroyers are compared, by the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former.
 (78) After winning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, (79) which contained the treasure and magazines of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp.
 Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times.
 In the poverty of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the desertion of the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers were exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been taught by experience, that the formidable cavalry of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of motion; (80) his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Larissa</GPE> the events of war were protracted and balanced.
 The courage of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was always conspicuous, and often successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the advantage, rather than the honour, of victory.
 After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> III invited by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1081.
 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.
 (84) But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people adhered to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; Besieges Rome, A.
D.
 1081-1084.
 and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany.
 In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war.
 The gates, the bridges, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> hostages, were delivered into his hands: A.
D.
 1081-1084, March 21.
 the anti-pope, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: March 24.
 the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; March 31.
 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.

 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.

 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The EAST » « Fall In The WEST » « Decline & Fall » Siege of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, June 17.
 At the mouth of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf, the shores of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Epirus</LOC> incline towards each other.
 The space between <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> and Durazzo, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> passage, is no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles; (65) at the last station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; (66) and this narrow distance had suggested to <PERSON>Pyrrhus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> the sublime or extravagant idea of a bridge.
 Before the general embarkation, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke despatched <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> with <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> galleys to seize or threaten the Isle of Corfu, to survey the opposite coast, and to secure a harbour in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Vallona</GPE> for the landing of the troops.
 They passed and landed without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks.
 The islands of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> and the maritime towns were subdued by the arms or the name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> (I use the modern appellation) to the siege of Durazzo.
 That city, the western key of the empire, was guarded by ancient renown, and recent fortifications, by <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, a patrician, victorious in the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> wars, and a numerous garrison of <NORP>Albanians</NORP> and Macedonians, who, in every age, have maintained the character of soldiers.
 In the prosecution of his enterprise, the courage of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was assailed by every form of danger and mischance.
 In the most propitious season of the year, as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow unexpectedly arose: the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was swelled by the raging blast of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the <NORP>Acroceraunian</NORP> rocks.
 (67) The sails, the masts, and the oars, were shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were covered with the fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged.
 The ducal galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> halted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of his loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers.
 The <NORP>Normans</NORP> were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had explored the ocean from <LOC>Greenland</LOC> to Mount Atlas, and who smiled at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean.
 They had wept during the tempest; they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians, who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> day's action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, (68) who led the naval powers of his father.
 All night the galleys of the republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions, the station of their archers, the weight of their javelins, and the borrowed aid of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire.
 The <NORP>Apulian</NORP> and <NORP>Ragusian</NORP> vessels fled to the shore, several were cut from their cables, and dragged away by the conqueror; and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke.
 A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo, and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and provision.
 That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease; <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred knights perished by an inglorious death; and the list of burials (if all could obtain a decent burial) amounted to <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand persons.
 Under these calamities, the mind of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> alone was firm and invincible; and while he collected new forces from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Sicily, he battered, or scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo.
 But his industry and valour were encountered by equal valour and more perfect industry.
 A movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers, had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart: but the descent of the door or drawbridge was checked by an enormous beam, and the wooden structure was constantly consumed by artificial flames.
 The army and the march of the emperor Alexius, April-September.
 While the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was attacked by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in the East, east, and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the West, the aged successor of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the founder of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasty.
 The princess Anne, his daughter and historian, observes, in her affected style, that even <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> was unequal to a double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a hasty peace with the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo.
 On his accession, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> found the camp without soldiers, and the treasury without money; yet such were the vigour and activity of his measures, that in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months he assembled an army of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand men, (69) and performed a march of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 His troops were levied in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, from <LOC>Peloponnesus</LOC> to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse-guards; and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes, some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed with the purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of affluence and dignity.
 Their youthful ardour might animate the multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their importunate clamours for speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded and starved the besieging army.
 The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world: the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the garrisons of Anatolia, or <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, had been purchased by the evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks.
 The strength of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> army consisted in the Varangians, the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule.
 Under the yoke of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conqueror, the <NORP>Danes</NORP> and <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> were oppressed and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long pilgrimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and revenge.
 They were entertained in the service of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> station was in a new city on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore: but <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valour.
 (70) The name of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in <LOC>Epirus</LOC> the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings.
 The <NORP>Varangians</NORP> were supported by some companies of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> or Latins; and the rebels, who had fled to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> from the tyranny of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their revenge.
 In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the impure aid of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> or <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valour.
 (71) The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> horse were opposed to the lances of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry.
 On the report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> assembled a council of his principal officers.
 "You behold," said he, "your danger: it is urgent and inevitable.
 The hills are covered with arms and standards; and the emperor of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> is accustomed to wars and triumphs.
 Obedience and union are our only safety; and I am ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader.
" The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke thus continued: "Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and deprive cowardice of the means of escape.
 Let us burn our vessels and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the place of our nativity and our burial.
" The resolution was unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his lines, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of the enemy.
 His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious, perhaps, that on the same ground <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had formerly disputed the empire of the world.
 (72) Battle of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, <DATE>October</DATE> 18.
 Against the advice of his wisest captains, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> resolved to risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town.
 He marched in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns to surprise the <NORP>Normans</NORP> before daybreak on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the archers formed the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line; and the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> claimed the honours of the vanguard.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 The <NORP>Lombards</NORP> and <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the garrison, and the coast was lined with the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys, who played their engines among the disorderly throng.
 On the verge of ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.
 Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as a warlike Amazon, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> goddess: (73) though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops.
 (74) Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: "Whither," he cried aloud, "whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and death is less grievous than servitude.
" The moment was decisive: as the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry.
 (75) <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune.
 The princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance, which had shivered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> helmet.
 His desperate valour broke through a squadron of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who opposed his flight; and after wandering <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus.
 The victorious <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp, and the glory of defeating an army <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times more numerous than his own.
 A multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> had been the victims of their own fears; but only <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> of his knights were slain in this memorable day.
 In the <NORP>Roman</NORP> host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and English, amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand: (76) the plain of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was more honorable than his life.
 <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> taken, A.
D.
 1082, February 8.
 It is more than probable that <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks.
 After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo; and a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> commander supplied the place of <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
 The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy.
 (77) Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage.
 At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the walls; the light <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ascended in silence; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror.
 Yet they defended the streets <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days against an enemy already master of the rampart; and near <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months elapsed between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> investment and the final surrender of the place.
 From Durazzo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke advanced into the heart of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> or Albania; traversed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mountains of Thessaly; surprised <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> tremble.
 A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs.
 By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> king of Germany.
 Return of Robert, and the actions of Bohemond.
 Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> counts, exhorting <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the authority of their leader.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of his father; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> destroyers are compared, by the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former.
 (78) After winning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, (79) which contained the treasure and magazines of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp.
 Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times.
 In the poverty of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the desertion of the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers were exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been taught by experience, that the formidable cavalry of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of motion; (80) his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Larissa</GPE> the events of war were protracted and balanced.
 The courage of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was always conspicuous, and often successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the advantage, rather than the honour, of victory.
 After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> III invited by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1081.
 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.
 (84) But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people adhered to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; Besieges Rome, A.
D.
 1081-1084.
 and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany.
 In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war.
 The gates, the bridges, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> hostages, were delivered into his hands: A.
D.
 1081-1084, March 21.
 the anti-pope, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: March 24.
 the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; March 31.
 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.

 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.
 Final extinction of the Normans, A.

 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The EAST » « Fall In The WEST » « Decline & Fall » The army and the march of the emperor Alexius, April-September.
 While the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was attacked by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in the East, east, and the <NORP>Normans</NORP> in the West, the aged successor of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the founder of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasty.
 The princess Anne, his daughter and historian, observes, in her affected style, that even <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> was unequal to a double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a hasty peace with the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo.
 On his accession, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> found the camp without soldiers, and the treasury without money; yet such were the vigour and activity of his measures, that in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months he assembled an army of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand men, (69) and performed a march of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 His troops were levied in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, from <LOC>Peloponnesus</LOC> to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse-guards; and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes, some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed with the purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of affluence and dignity.
 Their youthful ardour might animate the multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their importunate clamours for speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded and starved the besieging army.
 The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world: the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the garrisons of Anatolia, or <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, had been purchased by the evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks.
 The strength of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> army consisted in the Varangians, the <NORP>Scandinavian</NORP> guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule.
 Under the yoke of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conqueror, the <NORP>Danes</NORP> and <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> were oppressed and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long pilgrimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and revenge.
 They were entertained in the service of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> station was in a new city on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore: but <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valour.
 (70) The name of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in <LOC>Epirus</LOC> the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings.
 The <NORP>Varangians</NORP> were supported by some companies of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> or Latins; and the rebels, who had fled to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> from the tyranny of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their revenge.
 In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the impure aid of the <NORP>Paulicians</NORP> or <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valour.
 (71) The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> horse were opposed to the lances of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> cavalry.
 On the report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> assembled a council of his principal officers.
 The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke thus continued: The resolution was unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his lines, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of the enemy.
 His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious, perhaps, that on the same ground <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had formerly disputed the empire of the world.
 (72) Battle of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, <DATE>October</DATE> 18.
 Against the advice of his wisest captains, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> resolved to risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town.
 He marched in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns to surprise the <NORP>Normans</NORP> before daybreak on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the archers formed the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line; and the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> claimed the honours of the vanguard.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 The <NORP>Lombards</NORP> and <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the garrison, and the coast was lined with the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys, who played their engines among the disorderly throng.
 On the verge of ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.
 Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as a warlike Amazon, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> goddess: (73) though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops.
 (74) Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: "Whither," he cried aloud, "whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and death is less grievous than servitude.
" The moment was decisive: as the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry.
 (75) <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune.
 The princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance, which had shivered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> helmet.
 His desperate valour broke through a squadron of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who opposed his flight; and after wandering <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus.
 The victorious <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp, and the glory of defeating an army <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times more numerous than his own.
 A multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> had been the victims of their own fears; but only <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> of his knights were slain in this memorable day.
 In the <NORP>Roman</NORP> host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and English, amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand: (76) the plain of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was more honorable than his life.
 <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> taken, A.
D.
 1082, February 8.
 It is more than probable that <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks.
 After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo; and a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> commander supplied the place of <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
 The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy.
 (77) Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage.
 At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the walls; the light <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ascended in silence; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror.
 Yet they defended the streets <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days against an enemy already master of the rampart; and near <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months elapsed between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> investment and the final surrender of the place.
 From Durazzo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke advanced into the heart of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> or Albania; traversed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mountains of Thessaly; surprised <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> tremble.
 A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs.
 By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> king of Germany.
 Return of Robert, and the actions of Bohemond.
 Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> counts, exhorting <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the authority of their leader.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of his father; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> destroyers are compared, by the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former.
 (78) After winning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, (79) which contained the treasure and magazines of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp.
 Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times.
 In the poverty of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the desertion of the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers were exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been taught by experience, that the formidable cavalry of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of motion; (80) his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Larissa</GPE> the events of war were protracted and balanced.
 The courage of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was always conspicuous, and often successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the advantage, rather than the honour, of victory.
 After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> III invited by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1081.
 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.
 (84) But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people adhered to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; Besieges Rome, A.
D.
 1081-1084.
 and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany.
 In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war.
 The gates, the bridges, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> hostages, were delivered into his hands: A.
D.
 1081-1084, March 21.
 the anti-pope, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: March 24.
 the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; March 31.
 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.

 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.

 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The EAST » « Fall In The WEST » « Decline & Fall » Battle of Durazzo, A.
D.
 1081, <DATE>October</DATE> 18.
 Against the advice of his wisest captains, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> resolved to risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town.
 He marched in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns to surprise the <NORP>Normans</NORP> before daybreak on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the archers formed the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line; and the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> claimed the honours of the vanguard.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 The <NORP>Lombards</NORP> and <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the garrison, and the coast was lined with the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys, who played their engines among the disorderly throng.
 On the verge of ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.
 Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as a warlike Amazon, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> goddess: (73) though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops.
 (74) Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: The moment was decisive: as the <NORP>Varangians</NORP> advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the <NORP>French</NORP> cavalry.
 (75) <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune.
 The princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance, which had shivered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> helmet.
 His desperate valour broke through a squadron of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who opposed his flight; and after wandering <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus.
 The victorious <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp, and the glory of defeating an army <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times more numerous than his own.
 A multitude of <NORP>Italians</NORP> had been the victims of their own fears; but only <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> of his knights were slain in this memorable day.
 In the <NORP>Roman</NORP> host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and English, amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand: (76) the plain of <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was more honorable than his life.
 <ORG>Durazzo</ORG> taken, A.
D.
 1082, February 8.
 It is more than probable that <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks.
 After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo; and a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> commander supplied the place of <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
 The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy.
 (77) Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage.
 At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the walls; the light <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ascended in silence; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror.
 Yet they defended the streets <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days against an enemy already master of the rampart; and near <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months elapsed between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> investment and the final surrender of the place.
 From Durazzo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke advanced into the heart of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> or Albania; traversed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mountains of Thessaly; surprised <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> tremble.
 A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs.
 By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> king of Germany.
 Return of Robert, and the actions of Bohemond.
 Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> counts, exhorting <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the authority of their leader.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of his father; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> destroyers are compared, by the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former.
 (78) After winning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, (79) which contained the treasure and magazines of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp.
 Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times.
 In the poverty of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the desertion of the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers were exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been taught by experience, that the formidable cavalry of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of motion; (80) his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Larissa</GPE> the events of war were protracted and balanced.
 The courage of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was always conspicuous, and often successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the advantage, rather than the honour, of victory.
 After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> III invited by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1081.
 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.
 (84) But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people adhered to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; Besieges Rome, A.

 1081-1084.
 and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany.
 In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war.
 The gates, the bridges, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> hostages, were delivered into his hands: A.
D.
 1081-1084, March 21.
 the anti-pope, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: March 24.
 the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; March 31.
 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.
D.
 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.
 <PERSON>William</PERSON> I.
 the Bad king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1154, Feb.
26 -A.
D.
 1166, <DATE>May</DATE> 7.
 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.

 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.

 1082, February 8.
 It is more than probable that <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was not afflicted by the loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of the Greeks.
 After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence of Durazzo; and a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> commander supplied the place of <PERSON>George</PERSON> Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
 The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their obstinacy.
 (77) Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence with a <NORP>Venetian</NORP> noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage.
 At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the walls; the light <NORP>Calabrians</NORP> ascended in silence; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror.
 Yet they defended the streets <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days against an enemy already master of the rampart; and near <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months elapsed between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> investment and the final surrender of the place.
 From Durazzo, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> duke advanced into the heart of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> or Albania; traversed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mountains of Thessaly; surprised <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> tremble.
 A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs.
 By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> king of Germany.
 Return of Robert, and the actions of Bohemond.
 Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the command of his son and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> counts, exhorting <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the authority of their leader.
 The son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> trod in the footsteps of his father; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> destroyers are compared, by the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former.
 (78) After winning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, (79) which contained the treasure and magazines of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> camp.
 Yet a just praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the calamities of the times.
 In the poverty of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the desertion of the <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> replaced and revenged the loss of their brethren; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers were exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been taught by experience, that the formidable cavalry of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of motion; (80) his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an attack.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Larissa</GPE> the events of war were protracted and balanced.
 The courage of <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> was always conspicuous, and often successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> returned to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the advantage, rather than the honour, of victory.
 After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.
 The emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> III invited by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1081.
 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.
 (84) But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people adhered to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; Besieges Rome, A.

 and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany.
 In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war.
 The gates, the bridges, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> hostages, were delivered into his hands: A.
D.
 1081-1084, March 21.
 the anti-pope, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: March 24.
 the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; March 31.
 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.
D.
 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.

 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.

 Of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes, the allies of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> and enemies of Robert, the most prompt and powerful was <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> or Fourth, king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and future emperor of the West.
 The epistle of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch (81) to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and private tie.
 He congratulates <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> on his success in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> Robert.
 The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age - a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of purple.
 To these he added a more solid present, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four thousand <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> of gold, with a further assurance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> should have entered in arms the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against the common enemy.
 The German, (82) who was already in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> bribe.
 <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, his implacable foe.
 The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: (83) the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
 After the defeat and death of his <NORP>Swabian</NORP> rebel, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> descended into Italy, to assume the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, and to drive from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the tyrant of the church.

 and the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The ruins of the <PRODUCT>Septizonium</PRODUCT> were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
 Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 Their friendship had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from <GPE>Salerno</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> was animated by the public applause and the promise of the divine favour.
 Henry, invincible in <DATE>sixty-six</DATE> battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to persevere in their allegiance; Flies before Robert, May.
 and hastily retreated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before the entrance of the Normans.
 In less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the son of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, to fly before his victorious arms.
 (85) But the triumph of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was clouded by the calamities of Rome.
 By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or scaled; but the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> faction was still powerful and active; on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage.
 (86) The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, from the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude.
 (87) From a city, where he was now hated, and might be no longer feared, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno.
 The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> with the hope of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> or <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown; but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.
D.
 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.
D.
 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.
 Final extinction of the Normans, A.

 1204.
 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The EAST » « Fall In The WEST » « Decline & Fall » <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> into Greece, A.
D.
 1084, October.
 The deliverer and scourge of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might have indulged himself in a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, the indefatigable <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> resumed the design of his eastern conquests.
 The zeal or gratitude of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had promised to his valour the kingdoms of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia; (88) his troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager for action.
 Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared by <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> to a swarm of bees; (89) yet the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> have been already defined; they were contained on this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> occasion in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbour of <PRODUCT>Brundusium</PRODUCT> (90) was preferred to the open road of Otranto.
 Alexius, apprehensive of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attack, had assiduously labored to restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> an important succour of <CARDINAL>thirty-six</CARDINAL> transports, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude.
 Their services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St.
 Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi.
 By the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Venetians, the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> troops were safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus.
 With <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> strong and well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, to the event of a naval combat.
 The dominion of the sea was disputed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the skill and numbers of the allies were superior; but in the third, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> obtained a final and complete victory.
 (91) The light brigantines of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were scattered in ignominious flight: the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> castles of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> maintained a more obstinate conflict; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> were sunk, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were taken; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> deplores the loss of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects or allies.
 The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the advantages of the enemy.
 The <DATE>winter</DATE> season suspended his progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigour and effect.
 His death, A.
D.
 1085, July 17.
 But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> himself, in the seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of poison was imputed, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (92) This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares, that the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> greatness was founded on his life.
 (93) Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his deliverance.
 The galley which transported the remains of <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was ship-wrecked on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; but the duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, (94) a place more illustrious for the birth of <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> (95) than for the burial of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> heroes.
 Roger, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant <PERSON>Bohemond</PERSON> to the inheritance of his sword.
 The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade against the infidels of the <LOC>East</LOC> opened a more splendid field of glory and conquest.
 (96) Reign and ambition of Roger, great count of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> , A.
D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.

 1130, Dec.
 25- A.
D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.
 1156.
 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.

 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.
 Final extinction of the Normans, A.

 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.

D.
 1101-1154, February 26.
 Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and soon bounded by the sepulchre.
 The male line of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> <PERSON>Guiscard</PERSON> was extinguished, both in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and at Antioch, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation; but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Roger.
 (97) The heir of that <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at the age of only <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
 Had <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies, (98) the opulence and power of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> alone might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war.
 But the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice.
 He sought to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety had been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the declining health of his cousin <PERSON>William</PERSON> of Apulia, the grandson of Robert.
 Duke of Apulia, A.
D.
 1127.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of his premature death, <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> sailed from <GPE>Palermo</GPE> with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno, received, after <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal.
 The sacred spot of <PERSON>Benevento</PERSON> was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the reduction of <GPE>Capua</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> completed the design of his uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> conquests was possessed by the victorious Roger.
 A conscious superiority of power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom (99) which would only yield to the monarchies of <GPE>France</GPE> and England.
 The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at <GPE>Palermo</GPE> might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them; but the example of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant or a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> emir was insufficient to justify his regal character; and the <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> kings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world (100) might disclaim their new associate, unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> king of Sicily, A.

D.
 1139, July 25.
 The pride of <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> had stooped to solicit; (101) but his own legitimacy was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of Europe.
 The infant monarchy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St.
 Bernard, were united for the ruin of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> robber.
 After a gallant resistance, the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> end of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel.
 But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious duration: the <NORP>German</NORP> armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: (102) the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his predecessor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.
 His conquests in Africa, A.
D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.

 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.

 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.

 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.

 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.
 Final extinction of the Normans, A.

 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.

D.
 1122-1152.
 As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
 Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and revenge.
 The recent injuries of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> might provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength they contended with the decline of an <NORP>African</NORP> power.
 When the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> with a gift of his royal mantle, and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses, his palace with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of <GPE>Tunis</GPE> and Algiers.
 The Zeirides, (103) the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an <NORP>Oriental</NORP> dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness.
 On the side of the land, they were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pieces of gold.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
 Tripoli, (104) a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> themselves.
 The capital of the <GPE>Zeirides</GPE> was named <LOC>Africa</LOC> from the country, and <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> (105) from the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> founder: it is strongly built on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain.
 <PERSON>Mahadia</PERSON> was besieged by <PERSON>George</PERSON> the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks.
 In successive expeditions, the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; (106) the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held <LOC>Africa</LOC> in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger.
 (107) After his death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor.
 (108) The triumphs of <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> have proved, that the <NORP>African</NORP> continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain.
 His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.
D.
 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.

 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.

 1185.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.
 Final extinction of the Normans, A.

 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The EAST » « Fall In The WEST » « Decline & Fall » His invasion of Greece, A.
D.
 1146.
 Since the decease of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> Guiscard, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> had relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
 The policy of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> solicited a public and private union with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event.
 But the contemptuous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was expiated, according to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people.
 (109) With the fleet of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a tribute.
 In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of commerce, the <NORP>Normans</NORP> spread themselves by sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty.
 Of the wrongs of Athens, no memorial remains.
 The ancient walls, which encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians; but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or industry.
 On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> was evacuated; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any advantages of art or nature.
 As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint.
 The silk weavers of both sexes, whom <PERSON>George</PERSON> transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom were the only weapons which the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were capable of using.
 His admiral delivers <PERSON>LouisVII</PERSON> of France.
 The progress of this naval armament was marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion.
 The fortunate encounter of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily, <PERSON>Louis</PERSON> continued his journey to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Paris.
 (110) insults <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> In the absence of the emperor, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> were left without defence and without the suspicion of danger.
 The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city.
 The forces of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral were inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but <PERSON>George</PERSON> enjoyed the glory of humbling the <NORP>Greek</NORP> arrogance, and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West.
 He landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the palace of the Caesars.
 (111) The emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> repulses the Normans, A.
D.
 1148, 1149.
 This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge.
 The <LOC>Archipelago</LOC> and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favourable allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred vessels, which is proposed by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian.
 These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward voyage <PERSON>George</PERSON> lost <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> of his galleys, which were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, <PERSON>Corfu</PERSON> implored the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> prince, be found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 The prosperity and the health of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> were already in a declining state: while he listened in his palace of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> to the messengers of victory or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was celebrated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> as the <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of the age.
 He reduces <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, A.

 1155.
 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.

 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.

 Ten <DATE>years</DATE> after this revolution, the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude, among the vanquished nations.

 A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled the insolence of a Barbarian.
 It was the right and duty, it might be the interest and glory, of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to restore the ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> vassal.
 (112) The natives of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> were still attached to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and worship, which had been inexorably proscribed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy: after the loss of her dukes, <GPE>Apulia</GPE> was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> himself invited the enemies of his family and nation.
 The majesty of the purple, and a series of <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> wars, prevented <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> from embarking his person in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition.
 To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch entrusted a fleet and army: the siege of <PERSON>Bari</PERSON> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory.
 Salerno, and some places along the western coast, maintained their fidelity to the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> king; but he lost in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with the reduction of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred cities or villages of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace.
 The prejudices of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars; (113) His design of acquiring <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1155-1174, etc.
 but the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and unbounded promises, of their <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally, the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa: the walls of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians.
 (114) The situation and trade of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (115) The pride of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> disdained and rejected a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the <NORP>German</NORP> usurpers, and of establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans.
 With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome.
 Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family, (116) and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
 (117) During the quarrel between <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, the pope twice received in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the ambassadors of Constantinople.
 They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff to seize the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage insolence of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> and to acknowledge the true representative of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Augustus.
 (118) Failure of his designs.
 But these <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the hand of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.
D.

 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.

 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.

 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.

 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> demands were eluded by the prudence of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous revolution; (119) nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> name.
 After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 (120) The free cities of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice.
 (121) By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> merchants.
 This violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial people: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of <LOC>Dalmatia</LOC> and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding generation.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
 His prophecy was soon verified: the death of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the <NORP>Normans</NORP> and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their conqueror.
 (122) Yet the king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army on the <NORP>Italian</NORP> shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; Peace with the Normans, A.

 solicited a peace or truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (123) The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> army; and the truce of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was not disturbed by any hostilities between <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople.
 About the end of that period, the throne of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race; and the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> might salute the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies.
 Last war of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans, A.

 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> historians (124) expatiate on the rapid progress of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counts who invaded <GPE>Romania</GPE> with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (125) accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> city of the empire.
 The former deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe.
 The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo.
 A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus, had united against the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> the zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand captives.
 Such was the event of the last contest between the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Normans: before the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, the rival nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> did not long survive to insult the fall of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> monarchy.

 The sceptre of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> successively devolved to his son and grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to either of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> princes.
 When he was roused to arms by danger and shame, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>William</PERSON> did not degenerate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the life, of his benefactor.
 From the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquest, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> had imbibed a deep tincture of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mahomet.
 An eloquent historian of the times (126) has delineated the misfortunes of his country: (127) the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and the continent, during the reign of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the First, and the minority of his son.

 The youth, innocence, and beauty of <PERSON>William</PERSON> the Second, (128) endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread of futurity.
 The legitimate male posterity of <PERSON>Tancred</PERSON> of <GPE>Hauteville</GPE> was extinct in the person of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> William; but his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the age; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth, the son of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to claim the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown and the inheritance of his wife.
 Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
 Lamentation of the historian Falcandus.
 "Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
 Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust.
 I see the massacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons.
 (129) In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> act? By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and <GPE>Calabria</GPE> might yet be preserved; (130) for in the levity of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor hope.
 (131) Should <GPE>Calabria</GPE> be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, (132) might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
 If the savage <NORP>Germans</NORP> coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, (133) what resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? (134) <PERSON>Catana</PERSON> has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> expires in poverty and solitude; (135) but <GPE>Palermo</GPE> is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Saracens.
 If the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with invincible arms.
 But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.
" (136) We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.
 Conquest of the kingdom of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> VI.

 1194.
 The hopes, or at least the wishes, of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> were at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish.
 During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the <NORP>Apulian</NORP> frontier, against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason.
 After his decease, the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> pursued his victorious march from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to Palermo.
 The political balance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous union of the <NORP>German</NORP> empire with the kingdom of Sicily.
 But the subtle policy, for which the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that <PERSON>Celestine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> had kicked away the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown from the head of the prostrate Henry, (137) such an act of impotent pride could serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy.
 The Genoese, who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: (138) their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of Palermo; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his government was to abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies.
 The last hope of <PERSON>Falcandus</PERSON> was defeated by the discord of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the latter were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the peace of the island.
 By the policy of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, sixty thousand <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were transplanted to <GPE>Nocera</GPE> in Apulia.
 In their wars against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, the emperor and his son <PERSON>Mainfroy</PERSON> were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou.
 (139) All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the <NORP>German</NORP> conqueror.
 He violated the royal sepulchres and explored the secret treasures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily.
 (140) The young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of posterity.
 <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> herself was touched with sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age under the name of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second.
