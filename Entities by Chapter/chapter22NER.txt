<PERSON>Julian</PERSON> is declared emperor by the legions of Gaul—His march and success—The death of Constantius—Civil Administration of JulianThe jealousy of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> against Julian.
 While the <NORP>Romans</NORP> languished under the ignominious tyranny of eunuchs and bishops, the praises of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were repeated with transport in every part of the empire, except in the palace of Constantius.
 The barbarians of <GPE>Germany</GPE> had felt, and still dreaded, the arms of the young Caesar; his soldiers were the companions of his victory; the grateful provincials enjoyed the blessings of his reign; but the favourites, who had opposed his elevation, were offended by his virtues; and they justly considered the friend of the people as the enemy of the court.
 As long as the fame of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was doubtful, the buffoons of the palace, who were skilled in the language of satire, tried the efficacy of those arts which they had so often practised with success.
 They easily discovered that his simplicity was not exempt from affectation: the ridiculous epithets of an hairy savage, of an ape invested with the purple, were applied to the dress and person of the philosophic warrior; and his modest despatches were stigmatised as the vain and elaborate fictions of a loquacious Greek, a speculative soldier, who had studied the art of war amidst the groves of the Academy.
 (1) The voice of malicious folly was at length silenced by the shouts of victory; the conqueror of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> could no longer be painted as an object of contempt; and the monarch himself was meanly ambitious of stealing from his lieutenant the honourable reward of his labours.
 In the letters crowned with laurel, which, according to ancient custom, were addressed to the provinces, the name of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was omitted.
 from which he was at that time distant above forty days' journey.
 (2) So extravagant a fable was incapable, however, of deceiving the public credulity, or even of satisfying the pride of the emperor himself.
 Secretly conscious that the applause and favour of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> accompanied the rising fortunes of Julian, his discontented mind was prepared to receive the subtle poison of those artful sycophants who coloured their mischievous designs with the fairest appearances of truth and candour.
 (3) Instead of depreciating the merits of Julian, they acknowledged, and even exaggerated, his popular fame, superior talents, and important services.
 But they darkly insinuated that the virtues of the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> might instantly be converted into the most dangerous crimes, if the inconstant multitude should prefer their inclinations to their duty; or if the general of a victorious army should be tempted from his allegiance by the hopes of revenge and independent greatness.
 Fears and envy of Constantius.
 The personal fears of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> were interpreted by his council as a laudable anxiety for the public safety; whilst in private, and perhaps in his own breast, he disguised, under the less odious appellation of fear, the sentiments of hatred and envy which he had secretly conceived for the inimitable virtues of Julian.
 The legions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> are ordered to march into the East.
 A.
D.
 360, April T he apparent tranquillity of Gaul, and the imminent danger of the eastern provinces, offered a specious pretence for the design which was artfully concerted by the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> ministers.
 They resolved to disarm the Caesar; to recall those faithful troops who guarded his person and dignity; and to employ, in a distant war against the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch, the hardy veterans who had vanquished, on the banks of the Rhine, the fiercest nations of Germany.
 While <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> used the laborious hours of his <DATE>winter</DATE> quarters at <GPE>Paris</GPE> in the administration of power, which, in his hands, was the exercise of virtue, he was surprised by the hasty arrival of a tribune and a notary, with positive orders from the emperor, which they were directed to execute, and he was commanded not to oppose.
 <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> signified his pleasure that <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> entire legions—the <NORP>Celtae</NORP> and Petulants, the <NORP>Heruli</NORP> and the Batavians—should be separated from the standard of Julian, under which they had acquired their fame and discipline; that in each of the remaining bands <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred of the bravest youths should be selected and that this numerous detachment, the strength of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> army, should instantly begin their march, and exert their utmost diligence to arrive, before the opening of the campaign, on the frontiers of Persia.
 (4) The <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> foresaw and lamented the consequences of this fatal mandate.
 Most of the auxiliaries, who engaged their voluntary service, had stipulated that they should never be obliged to pass the Alps.
 The public faith of Rome, and the personal honour of Julian, had been pledged for the observance of this condition.
 Such an act of treachery and oppression would destroy the confidence, and excite the resentment of the independent warriors of Germany, who considered truth as the noblest of their virtues, and freedom as the most valuable of their possessions.
 The legionaries, who enjoyed the title and privileges of Romans, were enlisted for the general defence of the republic; but those mercenary troops heard with cold indifference the antiquated names of the republic and of Rome.
 Attached, either from birth or long habit, to the climate and manners of Gaul, they loved and admired Julian; they despised, and perhaps hated, the emperor; they dreaded the laborious march, the <NORP>Persian</NORP> arrows, and the burning deserts of Asia.
 They claimed as their own the country which they had saved; and excused their want of spirit by pleading the sacred and more immediate duty of protecting heir families and friends.
 The apprehensions of the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> were derived from the knowledge of the impending and inevitable danger.
 As soon as the provinces were exhausted of their military strength, the <NORP>Germans</NORP> would violate a treaty which had been imposed on their fears; and notwithstanding the abilities and valour of Julian, the general of a nominal army, to whom the public calamities would be imputed, must find himself, after a vain resistance, either a prisoner in the camp of the barbarians, or a criminal in the palace of Constantius.
 If <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> complied with the orders which he had received he subscribed to his own destruction, and that of a people who deserved his affection.
 But a positive refusal was an act of rebellion and a declaration of war.
 The inexorable jealousy of the emperor, the peremptory, and perhaps insidious, nature of his commands, left not any room for a fair apology or candid interpretation; and the dependent station of the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> scarcely allowed him to pause or to deliberate.
 Solitude increased the perplexity of Julian; he could no longer apply to the faithful counsels of Sallust, who had been removed from his office by the judicious malice of the eunuchs: he could not even enforce his representations by the concurrence of the ministers, who would have been afraid or ashamed to approve the ruin of Gaul.
 The moment had been chosen when Lupicinus, (5) the general of the cavalry, was despatched into Britain, to repulse the inroads of the <NORP>Scots</NORP> and Picts; and <PERSON>Florentius</PERSON> was occupied at <GPE>Vienne</GPE> by the assessment of the tribute.
 The latter, a crafty and corrupt statesman, declining to assume a responsible part on this dangerous occasion, eluded the pressing and repeated invitations of Julian, who represented to him that in every important measure the presence of the praefect was indispensable in the council of the prince.
 In the meanwhile the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> was oppressed by the rude and importunate solicitations of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> messengers, who presumed to suggest that, if he expected the return of his ministers, he could charge himself with the guilt of the delay, and reserve for them the merit of the execution.
 Unable to resist, unwilling to comply, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> expressed in the most serious terms his wish, and even his intention, of resigning the purple, which he could not preserve with honour, but which he could not abdicate with safety.
 Their discontents After a painful conflict, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was compelled to acknowledge that obedience was the virtue of the most eminent subject, and that the sovereign alone was entitled to judge of the public welfare.
 He issued the necessary orders for carrying into execution the commands of Constantius; a part of the troops began their march for the Alps; and the detachments from the several garrisons moved towards their respective places of assembly.
 They advanced with difficulty through the trembling and affrighted crowds of provincials, who attempted to excite their pity by silent despair or loud lamentations; while the wives of the soldiers, holding their infants in their arms, accused the desertion of their husbands in the mixed language of grief, of tenderness, and of indignation.
 This scene of general distress afflicted the humanity of the Caesar; he granted a sufficient number of post-waggons to transport the wives and families of the soldiers, (6) endeavoured to alleviate the hardships which he was constrained to inflict, and increased by the most laudable arts his own popularity and the discontent of the exiled troops.
 The grief of an armed multitude is soon converted into rage, their licentious murmurs, which every hour were communicated from tent to tent with more boldness and effect, prepared their minds for the most daring acts of sedition; and by the connivance of their tribunes a seasonable libel was secretly dispersed, which painted in lively colours the disgrace of the Caesar, the oppression of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> army, and the feeble vices of the tyrant of Asia.
 The servants of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> were astonished and alarmed by the progress of this dangerous spirit.
 They pressed the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> to hasten the departure of the troops; but they imprudently rejected the honest and judicious advice of Julian, who proposed that they should not march through Paris, and suggested the danger and temptation of a last interview.
 They proclaim <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> emperor.
 As soon as the approach of the troops was announced, the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> went out to meet them, and ascended his tribunal, which had been erected in a plain before the gates of the city.
 After distinguishing the officers and soldiers who by their rank or merit deserved a peculiar attention, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> addressed himself in a studied oration to the surrounding multitude: he celebrated their exploits with grateful applause; encouraged them to accept, with alacrity, the honour of serving under the eyes of a powerful and liberal monarch; and admonished them that the commands of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> required an instant and cheerful obedience.
 The soldiers, who were apprehensive of offending their general by an indecent clamour, or of belying their sentiments by false and venal acclamations, maintained an obstinate silence; and, after a short pause, were dismissed to their quarters.
 The principal officers were entertained by the Caesar, who professed, in the warmest language of friendship, his desire and his inability to reward, according to their deserts, the brave companions of his victories.
 They retired from the feast full of grief and perplexity; and lamented the hardship of their fate, which tore them from their beloved general and their native country.
 The only expedient which could prevent their separation was boldly agitated and approved, the popular resentment was insensibly moulded into a regular conspiracy; their just reasons of complaint were heightened by passion, and their passions were inflamed by wine, as on the eve of their departure the troops were indulged in licentious festivity.
 At the hour of midnight the impetuous multitude, with swords, and bows, and torches in their hands, rushed into the suburbs, encompassed the palace;(7) and, careless of future dangers, pronounced the fatal and irrevocable words, JULIAN AUGUSTUS! The prince, whose anxious suspense was interrupted by their disorderly acclamations, secured the doors against their intrusion; and, as long as it was in his power, secluded his person and dignity from the accidents of a nocturnal tumult.
 At the dawn of day the soldiers, whose zeal was irritated by opposition, forcibly entered the palace, seized, with respectful violence, the object of their choice, guarded <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> with drawn swords through the streets of Paris, placed him on the tribunal, and with repeated shouts saluted him as their emperor.
 <PERSON>Prudence</PERSON> as well as loyalty inculcated the propriety of resisting their treasonable designs, and of preparing for his oppressed virtue the excuse of violence.
 Addressing himself by turns to the multitude and to individuals, he sometimes implored their mercy, and sometimes expressed his indignation; conjured them not to sully the fame of their immortal victories; ventured to promise that if they would immediately return to their allegiance, he would undertake to obtain from the emperor not only a free and gracious pardon, but even the revocation of the orders which had excited their resentment.
 But the soldiers, who were conscious of their guilt, chose rather to depend on the gratitude of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> than on the clemency of the emperor.
 Their zeal was insensibly turned into impatience, and their impatience into rage.
 The inflexible <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> sustained, till the third hour of the day, their prayers, their reproaches, and their menaces; nor did he yield till he had been repeatedly assured that, if he wished to live, he must consent to reign.
 He was exalted on a shield in the presence and amidst the unanimous acclamations of the troops; a rich military collar, which was offered by chance, supplied the want of a diadem;(8) the ceremony was concluded by the promise of a moderate donative;(9) and the new emperor, overwhelmed with real or affected grief, retired into the most secret recesses of his apartment.
(10) His protestations of innocence .
 The grief of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> could proceed only from his innocence; but his innocence must appear extremely doubtful(11) in the eyes of those who have learned to suspect the motives and the professions of princes.
 His lively and active mind was susceptible of the various impressions of hope and fear, of gratitude and revenge, of duty and of ambition, of the love of fame and of the fear of reproach.
 But it is impossible for us to calculate the respective weight and operation of these sentiments; or to ascertain the principles of action which might escape the observation, while they guided, or rather impelled, the steps of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> himself.
 The discontent of the troops was produced by the malice of his enemies; their tumult was the natural effect of interest and of passion; and if <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had tried to conceal a deep design under the appearances of chance, he must have employed the most consummate artifice without necessity, and probably without success.
 He solemnly declares, in the presence of Jupiter, of the Sun, of Mars, of Minerva, and of all the other deities, that till the close of the evening which preceded his elevation he was utterly ignorant of the designs of the soldiers; (12) and it may seem ungenerous to distrust the honour of a hero, and the truth of a philosopher.
 Yet the superstitious confidence that <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was the enemy, and that he himself was the favourite, of the gods, might prompt him to desire, to solicit, and even to hasten the auspicious moment of his reign, which was predestined to restore the ancient religion of mankind.
 When <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had received the intelligence of the conspiracy, he resigned himself to a short slumber; and afterwards related to his friends that he had seen the Genius of the empire waiting with some impatience at his door, pressing for admittance, and reproaching his want of spirit and ambition.
 (13) Astonished and perplexed, he addressed his prayers to the great Jupiter, who immediately signified, by a clear and manifest omen, that he should submit to the will of heaven and of the army.
 The conduct which disclaims the ordinary maxims of reason excites our suspicion and eludes our inquiry.
 Whenever the spirit of fanaticism, at once so credulous and so crafty, has insinuated itself into a noble mind, it insensibly corrodes the vital principles of virtue and veracity.
 His envoy to Constantius.
 To moderate the zeal of his party, to protect the persons of his enemies, (14) to defeat and to despise the secret enterprises which were formed against his life and dignity, were the cares which employed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of the new emperor.
 Although he was firmly resolved to maintain the station which he had assumed, he was still desirous of saving his country from the calamities of civil war, of declining a contest with the superior forces of Constantius, and of preserving his own character from the reproach of perfidy and ingratitude.
 Adorned with the designs of military and imperial pomp, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> showed himself in the field of <LOC>Mars</LOC> to the soldiers, who glowed with ardent enthusiasm in the cause of their pupil, their leader, and their friend.
 He recapitulated their victories, lamented their sufferings, applauded their resolution, animated their hopes, and checked their impetuosity; nor did he dismiss the assembly till he had obtained a solemn promise from the troops that, if the emperor of the <LOC>East</LOC> would subscribe an equitable treaty, they would renounce any views of conquest, and satisfy themselves with the tranquil possession of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> provinces.
 On this foundation he composed, in his own name, and in that of the army, a specious and moderate epistle,(15) which was delivered to Pentadius, his master of the offices, and to his chamberlain Eutherius; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors whom he appointed to receive the answer and observe the dispositions of Constantius.
 This epistle is inscribed with the modest appellation of Caesar; but <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> solicits in a peremptory, though respectful manner, the confirmation of the title of Augustus.
 He acknowledges the irregularity of his own election, while he justifies in some measure, the resentment and violence of the troops which had extorted his reluctant consent.
 He allows the supremacy of his brother Constantius; and engages to send him an annual present of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> horses, to recruit his army with a select number of barbarian youths, and to accept from his choice a <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of approved discretion and fidelity.
 But he reserves for himself the nomination of his other civil and military officers, with the troops, the revenue, and the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps.
 He admonishes the emperor to consult the dictates of justice; to distrust the arts of those venal flatterers who subsist only by the discord of princes; and to embrace the offer of a fair and honourable treaty, equally advantageous to the republic and to the house of Constantine.
 In this negotiation <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> claimed no more than he already possessed.
 The delegated authority which he had long exercised over the provinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was still obeyed under a name more independent and august.
 The soldiers and the people rejoiced in revolution which was not stained even with the blood of the guilty.
 <PERSON>Florentius</PERSON> was a fugitive; <PERSON>Lupicinus</PERSON> a prisoner.
 The persons who were disaffected to the new government were disarmed and secured; and the vacant offices were distributed, according to the recommendation of merit, by a prince who despised the intrigues of the palace and the clamours of the soldiers.
(16) His <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> expedition beyond the Rhine.
 A.
D.
 360,361.
 The negotiations of peace were accompanied and supported by the most vigorous preparations for war.
 The army, which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> held in readiness for immediate action, was recruited and augmented by the disorders of the times.
 The cruel persecution of the faction of <ORG>Magnentius</ORG> had filled <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> with numerous bands of outlaws and robbers.
 They cheerfully accepted the offer of a general pardon from a prince whom they could trust, submitted to the restraints of military discipline, and retained only their implacable hatred to the person and government of Constantius.
 (17) As soon as the season of the year permitted <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> to take the field, he appeared at the head of his legions; threw a bridge over the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> in the neighbourhood of Cleves; and prepared to chastise the perfidy of the Attuarii, a tribe of Franks, who presumed that they might ravage with impunity the frontiers of a divided empire.
 The difficulty, as well as glory, of this enterprise consisted in a laborious march; and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had conquered, as soon as he could penetrate into, a country which former princes had considered as inaccessible.
 After he had given peace to the barbarians, the emperor carefully visited the fortifications along the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> from <LOC>Cleves</LOC> to Basel; surveyed, with peculiar attention, the territories which he had recovered from the hands of the Alemanni; passed through Besancon,(18) which had severely suffered from their fury; and fixed his headquarters at <GPE>Vienne</GPE> for the ensuing winter.
 The barrier of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was improved and strengthened with additional fortifications; and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> entertained some hopes that the Germans, whom he had so often vanquished, might, in his absence, be restrained by the terror of his name.
 Vadomair(19) was the only prince of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> whom he esteemed or feared; and while the subtle barbarian affected to observe the faith of treaties, the progress of his arms threatened the state with an unseasonable and dangerous war.
 The policy of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> condescended to surprise the prince of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> by his own arts: and Vadomair, who, in the character of a friend, had incautiously accepted an invitation from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> governors, was seized in the midst of the entertainment, and sent away prisoner into the heart of Spain.
 Before the barbarians were recovered from their amazement, the emperor appeared in arms on the banks of the Rhine, and, once more crossing the river, renewed the deep impressions of terror and respect which had been already made by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> preceding expeditions.
(20) Fruitless treaty and declaration of war, A.
D.
 361.
 The ambassadors of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had been instructed to execute with the utmost diligence their important commission.
 But in their passage through <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <GPE>Illyricum</GPE> they were detained by the tedious and affected delays of the provincial governors; they were conducted by slow journeys from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to <GPE>Caesarea</GPE> in Cappadocia; and when at length they were admitted to the presence of Constantius, they found that he had already conceived, from the despatches of his own officers, the most unfavourable opinion of the conduct of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> and of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> army.
 The letters were heard with impatience; the trembling messengers were dismissed with indignation and contempt; and the looks, the gestures, the furious language of the monarch, expressed the disorder of his soul.
 The domestic connection, which might have reconciled the brother and the husband of Helena, was recently dissolved by the death of that princess, whose pregnancy had been several times fruitless, and was at last fatal to herself.
 (21) The empress <PERSON>Eusebia</PERSON> had preserved, to the last moment of her life, the warm, and even jealous, affection which she had conceived for Julian; and her mild influence might have moderated the resentment of a prince who, since her death, was abandoned to his own passions, and to the arts of his eunuchs.
 But the terror of a foreign invasion obliged him to suspend the punishment of a private enemy; he continued his march towards the confines of Persia, and thought it sufficient to signify the conditions which might entitle <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> and his guilty followers to the clemency of their offended sovereign.
 He required that the presumptuous <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> should expressly renounce the appellation and rank of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> which he had accepted from the rebels; that he should descend to his former station of a limited and dependent minister; that he should vest the powers of the state and army in the hands of those officers who were appointed by the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court; and that he should trust his safety to the assurances of pardon, which were announced by Epictetus, a <NORP>Gallic</NORP> bishop, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> favourites of Constantius.
 Several months were ineffectually consumed in a treaty which was negotiated at the distance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand miles between <GPE>Paris</GPE> and Antioch; and, as soon as <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> perceived that his moderate and respectful behaviour served only to irritate the pride of an implacable adversary, he boldly resolved to commit his life and fortune to the chance of a civil war.
 He gave a public and military audience to the quaestor Leonas: the haughty epistle of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was read to the attentive multitude; and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> protested, with the most flattering deference, that he was ready to resign the title of Augustus, if he could obtain the consent of those whom he acknowledged as the authors of his elevation.
 The faint proposal was impetuously silenced; and the acclamations of thundered at once from every part of the field, and terrified the pale ambassador of Constantius.
 A part of the letter was afterwards read, in which the emperor arraigned the ingratitude of Julian, whom he had invested with the honours of the purple; whom he had educated with so much care and tenderness; whom he had preserved in his infancy, when he was left a helpless orphan.
 The assembly was dismissed; and Leonas, who with some difficulty had been protected from the popular fury, was sent back to his master with an epistle in which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> expressed, in a strain of the most vehement eloquence, the sentiments of contempt, of hatred, and of resentment, which had been suppressed and embittered by the dissimulation of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years.
 After this message, which might be considered as a signal of irreconcilable war, Julian, who some weeks before had celebrated the <NORP>Christian</NORP> festival of the Epiphany, (22) made a public declaration that he committed the care of his safety to the IMMORTAL GODS; and thus publicly renounced the religion as well as the friendship of Constantius.
 (23)Julian prepares to attack Constantius.
 The situation of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> required a vigorous and immediate resolution.
 He had discovered from intercepted letters that his adversary, sacrificing the interest of the state to that of the monarch, had again excited the barbarians to invade the provinces of the West.
 The position of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> magazines, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of them collected on the banks of the lake of Constance, the other formed at the foot of the Cottian Alps, seemed to indicate the march of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies; and the size of those magazines, each of which consisted of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred thousand quarters of wheat, or rather flour, (24) was a threatening evidence of the strength and numbers of the enemy who prepared to surround him.
 But the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> legions were still in their distant quarters of Asia; the <LOC>Danube</LOC> was feebly guarded; and if <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> could occupy, by a sudden incursion, the important provinces of Illyricum, he might expect that a people of soldiers would resort to his standard, and that the rich mines of gold and silver would contribute to the expenses of the civil war.
 He proposed this bold enterprise to the assembly of the soldiers; inspired them with a just confidence in their general, and in themselves; and exhorted them to maintain their reputation of being terrible to the enemy, moderate to their fellow-citizens, and obedient to their officers.
 His spirited discourse was received with the loudest acclamations, and the same troops which had taken up arms against Constantius, when he summoned them to leave Gaul, now declared with alacrity that they would follow <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> to the farthest extremities of <LOC>Europe</LOC> or Asia.
 The oath of fidelity was administered; and the soldiers, clashing their shields, and pointing their drawn swords to their throats, devoted themselves, with horrid imprecations, to the service of a leader whom they celebrated as the deliverer of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and the conqueror of the Germans.
(25) This solemn engagement, which seemed to be dictated by affection rather than by duty, was singly opposed by Nebridius, who had been admitted to the office of <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect.
 That faithful minister, alone and unassisted, asserted the rights of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the midst of an armed and angry multitude, to whose fury he had almost fallen an honourable, but useless sacrifice.
 After losing <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his hands by the stroke of a sword, he embraced the knees of the prince whom he had offended.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> covered the praefect with his <ORG>Imperial</ORG> mantle, and protecting him from the zeal of his followers, dismissed him to his own house, with less respect than was perhaps due to the virtue of an enemy.
(26) The high office of <GPE>Nebridius</GPE> was bestowed on Sallust; and the provinces of Gaul, which were now delivered from the intolerable oppression of taxes, enjoyed the mild and equitable administration of the friend of Julian, who was permitted to practise those virtues which he had instilled into the mind of his pupil.
(27) His march from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to Illyricum.
 The hopes of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> depended much less on the number of his troops than on the celerity of his motions.
 In the execution of a daring enterprise he availed himself of every precaution, as far as prudence could suggest; and where prudence could no longer accompany his steps, he trusted the event to valour and to fortune.
 In the neighbourhood of <GPE>Basel</GPE> he assembled and divided his army.
(28) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> body, which consisted of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand men, was directed, under the command of Nevitta, general of the cavalry, to advance through the midland parts of <GPE>Rhaetia</GPE> and Noricum.
 A similar division of troops, under the orders of <GPE>Jovius</GPE> and Jovinus, prepared to follow the oblique course of the highways through the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and the northern confines of Italy.
 The instructions to the generals were conceived with energy and precision: to hasten their march in close and compact columns, which, according to the disposition of the ground, might readily be changed into any order of battle; to secure themselves against the surprises of the night by strong posts and vigilant guards; to prevent resistance by their unexpected arrival; to elude examination by their sudden departure; to spread the opinion of their strength, and the terror of his name; and to join their sovereign under the walls of Sirmium.
 For himself <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had reserved a more difficult and extraordinary part.
 He selected <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand brave and active volunteers, resolved, like their leader, to cast behind them every hope of a retreat; at the head of this faithful band he fearlessly plunged into the recesses of the Marcian, or Black Forest, which conceals the sources of the Danube;(29) and, for many days, the fate of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was unknown to the world.
 The secrecy of his march, his diligence, and vigour, surmounted every obstacle; he forced his way over mountains and morasses, occupied the bridges or swam the rivers, pursued his direct course (30) without reflecting whether he traversed the territory of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> or of the barbarians, and at length emerged, between <GPE>Ratisbon</GPE> and Vienna, at the place where he designed to embark his troops on the Danube.
 By a well-concerted stratagem he seized a fleet of light brigantines(31) as it lay at anchor; secured a supply of coarse provisions sufficient to satisfy the indelicate, but voracious, appetite of a <NORP>Gallic</NORP> army; and boldly committed himself to the stream of the Danube.
 The labours of his mariners, who plied their oars with incessant diligence, and the steady continuance of a favourable wind, carried his fleet above seven hundred miles in eleven days;(32) and he had already disembarked his troops at Bononia, only nineteen miles from Sirmium, before his enemies could receive any certain intelligence that he had left the banks of the Rhine.
 In the course of this long and rapid navigation, the mind of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was fixed on the object of his enterprise; and though he accepted the deputation of some cities, which hastened to claim the merit of an early submission, he passed before the hostile stations, which were placed along the river, without indulging the temptation of signalising a useless and ill-timed valour.
 The banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were crowded on either side with spectators, who gazed on the military pomp, anticipated the importance of the event, and diffused through the adjacent country the fame of a young hero, who advanced with more than mortal speed at the head of the innumerable forces of the West.
 Lucilian, who, with the rank of general of the cavalry commanded the military powers of Illyricum, was alarmed and perplexed by the doubtful reports, which he could neither reject nor believe.
 He had taken some slow and irresolute measures for the purpose of collecting his troops, when he was surprised by Dagalaiphus, an active officer, whom Julian, as soon as he landed at Bononia, had pushed forward with some light infantry.
 The captive general, uncertain of his life or death, was hastily thrown upon a horse, and conducted to the presence of Julian, who kindly raised him from the ground, and dispelled the terror and amazement which seemed to stupefy his faculties.
 But <PERSON>Lucilian</PERSON> had no sooner recovered his spirits than he betrayed his want of discretion, by presuming to admonish his conqueror that he had rashly ventured, with a handful of men, to expose his person in the midst of his enemies.
 Conscious that success alone could justify his attempt, and that boldness only could command success, he instantly advanced, at the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand soldiers, to attack the strongest and most populous city of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> provinces.
 As he entered the long suburb of Sirmium, he was received by the joyful acclamations of the army and people, who, crowned with flowers, and holding lighted tapers in their hands, conducted their acknowledged sovereign to the imperial residence.
 Two days were devoted to the public joy, which was celebrated by the games of the Circus; but, early on the morning of the third day, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> marched to occupy the narrow pass of Succi, in the defiles of Mount Haemus; which, almost in the midway between <ORG>Sirmium</ORG> and Constantinople, separates the provinces of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Dacia, by an abrupt descent towards the former, and a gentle declivity on the side of the latter.
 (33) The defence of this important post was intrusted to the brave Nevitta, who, as well as the generals of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> division, successfully executed the plan of the march and junction which their master had so ably conceived.
 (34) He justifies his cause.
 The homage which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> obtained from the fears or the inclination of the people extended far beyond the immediate effect of his arms.
 (35) The praefectures of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <GPE>Illyricum</GPE> were administered by <PERSON>Taurus</PERSON> and Florentius, who united that important office with the vain honours of the consulship; and, as those magistrates had retired with precipitation to the court of Asia, Julian, who could not always restrain the levity of his temper, stigmatised their flight by adding, in all the Acts of the Year, the epithet of fugitive to the names of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> consuls.
 The provinces which had been deserted by their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrates acknowledged the authority of an emperor who, conciliating the qualities of a soldier with those of a philosopher, was equally admired in the camps of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and in the cities of Greece.
 From his palace, or, more properly, from his headquarters of <ORG>Sirmium</ORG> and Naissus, he distributed to the principal cities of the empire a laboured apology for his own conduct; published the secret despatches of Constantius; and solicited the judgment of mankind between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> competitors, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of whom had expelled, and the other had invited, the barbarians.
 (36) Julian, whose mind was deeply wounded by the reproach of ingratitude, aspired to maintain, by argument as well as by arms, the superior merits of his cause; and to excel not only in the arts of war, but in those of composition.
 His epistle to the senate and people of Athens(37) seems to have been dictated by an elegant enthusiasm, which prompted him to submit his actions and his motives to the degenerate <NORP>Athenians</NORP> of his own times, with the same humble deference as if he had been pleading in the days of <PERSON>Aristides</PERSON> before the tribunal of the Areopagus.
 His application to the senate of Rome, which was still permitted to bestow the titles of imperial power, was agreeable to the forms of the expiring republic.
 An assembly was summoned by Tertullus, praefect of the city; the epistle of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was read and, as he appeared to be master of Italy, his claims were admitted without a dissenting voice.
 His oblique censure of the innovations of Constantine, and his passionate invective against the vices of Constantius, were heard with less satisfaction; and the senate, as if <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had been present, unanimously exclaimed, "Respect, we beseech you, the author of your own fortune.
" (38) An artful expression, which, according to the chance of war, might be differently explained — as a manly reproof of the ingratitude of the usurper or as a flattering confession that a single act of such benefit to the state ought to atone for all the failings of Constantius.
 Hostile preparations.
.
 The intelligence of the march and rapid progress of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was speedily transmitted to his rival, who, by the retreat of Sapor, had obtained some respite from the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war.
 Disguising the anguish of his soul under the semblance of contempt, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> professed his intention of returning into Europe, and of giving chase to Julian; for he never spoke of this military expedition in any other light than that of a hunting party.
 (39) In the camp of Hierapolis, in Syria, he communicated this design to his army; slightly mentioned the guilt and rashness, of the Caesar; and ventured to assure them that, if the mutineers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> presumed to meet them in the field, they would be unable to sustain the fire of their eyes and the irresistible weight of their shout of onset.
 The speech of the emperor was received with military applause; and Theodotus, the president of the council of Hierapolis, requested, with tears of adulation, that his city might be adorned with the head of the vanquished rebel.
 (40) A chosen detachment was despatched away in post-waggons, to secure, if it were yet possible, the pass of Succi; the recruits; the horses, the arms, and the magazines, which had been prepared against Sapor, were appropriated to the service of the civil war; and the domestic victories of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> inspired his partisans with the most sanguine assurances of success.
 The notary <PERSON>Gaudentius</PERSON> had occupied in his name the provinces of Africa; the subsistence of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was intercepted; and the distress of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was increased by an unexpected event, which might have been productive of fatal consequences.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had received the submission of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> legions and a cohort of archers who were stationed at Sirmium, but he suspected, with reason, the fidelity of those troops which had been distinguished by the emperor; and it was thought expedient, under the pretence of the exposed state of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> frontier, to dismiss them from the most important scene of action.
 They advanced, with reluctance, as far as the confines of Italy; but, as they dreaded the length of the way and the savage fierceness of the Germans, they resolved, by the instigation of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their tribunes, to halt at Aquileia, and to erect the banners of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> on the walls of that impregnable city.
 The vigilance of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> perceived at once the extent of the mischief, and the necessity of applying an immediate remedy.
 By his order, <NORP>Jovinus</NORP> led back a part of the army into Italy; and the siege of <PERSON>Aquileia</PERSON> was formed with diligence and prosecuted with vigour.
 But the legionaries, who seemed to have rejected the yoke of discipline, conducted the defence of the place with skill and perseverance; invited the rest of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to imitate the example of their courage and loyalty; and threatened the retreat of Julian, if he should be forced to yield to the superior numbers of the armies of the East.
 (41) And death of Constantius, A.
D.
 361, November 30.
 But the humanity of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was preserved from the cruel alternative which he pathetically laments of destroying or of being himself destroyed: and the seasonable death of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> delivered the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire from the calamities of civil war.
 The approach of <DATE>winter</DATE> could not detain the monarch at Antioch; and his favourites durst not oppose his impatient desire of revenge.
 A slight fever, which was perhaps occasioned by the agitation of his spirits, was increased by the fatigues of the journey, and <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was obliged to halt at the little town of Mopsucrene, twelve miles beyond Tarsus, where he expired, after a short illness, in the forty-fifth year of his age, and the <CARDINAL>twenty-fourth</CARDINAL> of his reign.
(42) His genuine character, which was composed of pride and weakness, of superstition and cruelty, has been fully displayed in the preceding narrative of civil and ecclesiastical events.
 The long abuse of power rendered him a considerable object in the eyes of his contemporaries; but, as personal merit can alone deserve the notice of posterity, the last of the sons of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> may be dismissed from the world with the remark that he inherited the defects, without the abilities, of his father.
 Before <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> expired, he is said to have named <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> for his successor; nor does it seem improbable that his anxious concern for the fate of a young and tender wife, whom he left with child, may have prevailed in his last moments over the harsher passions of hatred and revenge.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and his guilty associates made a faint attempt to prolong the reign of the eunuchs by the election of another emperor; but their intrigues were rejected with disdain by an army which now abhorred the thought of civil discord and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> officers of rank were instantly despatched to assure <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> that every sword in the empire would be drawn for his service.
 The military designs of that prince, who had formed <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> different attacks against Thrace, were prevented by this fortunate event.
 Without shedding the blood of his fellow-citizens, he escaped the dangers of a doubtful conflict, and acquired the advantages of a complete victory.
 Impatient to visit the place of his birth and the new capital of the empire, he advanced from <GPE>Naissus</GPE> through the mountains of <GPE>Haemus</GPE> and the cities of Thrace.
 When he reached Heraclea, at the distance of sixty miles, all <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was poured forth to receive him; <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> enters Constantinople, December 11.
 and he made his triumphal entry amidst the dutiful acclamations of the soldiers, the people, and the senate.
 An innumerable multitude pressed around him with eager respect, and were perhaps disappointed when they beheld the small stature and simple garb of a hero, whose inexperienced youth had vanquished the barbarians of Germany, and who had now traversed, in a successful career, the whole continent of <LOC>Europe</LOC> from the shores of the <LOC>Atlantic</LOC> to those of the Bosphorus.
(43) A few days afterwards, when the remains of the deceased emperor were landed in the harbour, the subjects of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> applauded the real or affected humanity of their sovereign.
 On foot, without his diadem, and clothed in a mourning habit, he accompanied the funeral as far as the church of the Holy Apostles, where the body was deposited: and if these marks of respect may be interpreted as a selfish tribute to the birth and dignity of his <ORG>Imperial</ORG> kinsman, the tears of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> professed to the world that he had forgot the injuries, and remembered only the obligations, which he had received from Constantius.
(44) As soon as the legions of <PERSON>Aquileia</PERSON> were assured of the death of the emperor, they opened the gates of the city, and, by the sacrifice of their guilty leaders, obtained an easy pardon from the prudence or lenity of Julian; who, in the thirty-second year of his age, and is acknowledged by the whole empire acquired the undisputed possession of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
(45) His civil government and private life.
 Philosophy had instructed <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> to compare the advantages of action and retirement; but the elevation of his birth and the accidents of his life never allowed him the freedom of choice.
 He might perhaps sincerely have preferred the groves of the <ORG>Academy</ORG> and the society of Athens; but he was constrained, at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> by the will, and afterwards by the injustice of Constantius, to expose his person and fame to the dangers of <ORG>Imperial</ORG> greatness; and to make himself accountable to the world and to posterity for the happiness of millions.
 (46) <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> recollected with terror the observation of his master Plato,(47) that the government of our flocks and herds is always committed to beings of a superior species; and that the conduct of nations requires and deserves the celestial powers of the Gods or of the Genii.
 From this principle he justly concluded that the man who presumes to reign should aspire to the perfection of the divine nature; that he should purify his soul from her mortal and terrestrial part; that he should extinguish his appetites, enlighten his understanding, regulate his passions, and subdue the wild beast which, according to the lively metaphor of Aristotle,(48) seldom fails to ascend the throne of a despot.
 The throne of Julian, which the death of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> fixed on an independent basis, was the seat of reason, of virtue, and perhaps of vanity.
 He despised the honours, renounced the pleasures, and discharged with incessant diligence the duties of his exalted station: and there were few among his subjects who would have consented to relieve him from the weight of the diadem, had they been obliged to submit their time and their actions to the rigorous laws which their philosophic emperor imposed on himself.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of his most intimate friends,(49) who had often shared the frugal simplicity of his table, has remarked that his light and sparing diet (which was usually of the vegetable kind) left his mind and body always free and active for the various and important business of an author, a pontiff, a magistrate, a general, and a prince.
 In <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> and the same day he gave audience to several ambassadors, and wrote or dictated a great number of letters to his generals, his civil magistrates, his private friends, and the different cities of his dominions.
 He listened to the memorials which had been received, considered the subject of the petitions, and signified his intentions more rapidly than they could be taken in shorthand by the diligence of his secretaries.
 He possessed such flexibility of thought, and such firmness of attention, that he could employ his hand to write, his ear to listen, and his voice to dictate; and pursue at once <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> several trains of ideas without hesitation, and without error.
 While his ministers reposed, the prince flew with agility from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> labour to another; and, after a hasty dinner, retired into his library till the public business which he had appointed for the evening summoned him to interrupt the prosecution of his studies.
 The supper of the emperor was still less substantial than the former meal; his sleep was never clouded by the fumes of indigestion; and, except in the short interval of a marriage which was the effect of policy rather than love, the chaste <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> never shared his bed with a female companion.
 (50) He was soon awakened by the entrance of fresh secretaries, who had slept the preceding day; and his servants were obliged to wait alternately, while their indefatigable master allowed himself scarcely any other refreshment than the change of occupations.
 The predecessors of Julian, his uncle, his brother, and his cousin, indulged their puerile taste for the games of the Circus, under the specious pretence of complying with the inclinations of the people; and they frequently remained the greatest part of the day as idle spectators, and as a part of the splendid spectacle, till the ordinary round of <CARDINAL>twenty-four</CARDINAL> races(51) was completely finished.
 On solemn festivals, Julian, who felt and professed an unfashionable dislike to these frivolous amusements, condescended to appear in the Circus; and, after bestowing a careless glance on <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> of the races, he hastily withdrew with the impatience of a philosopher, who considered every moment as lost that was not devoted to the advantage of the public or the improvement of his own mind.
 (52) By this avarice of time he seemed to protract the short duration of his reign; and, if the dates were less securely ascertained, we should refuse to believe that only sixteen months elapsed between the death of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> and the departure of his successor for the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war.
 The actions of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> can only be preserved by the care of the historian; but the portion of his voluminous writings which is still extant remains as a monument of the application, as well as of the genius, of the emperor.
 The Misopogon, the Caesars, several of his orations, and his elaborate work against the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion, were composed in the long nights of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> winters, the former of which he passed at Constantinople, and the latter at Antioch.
 Reformation of the palace.
 The reformation of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court was <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most necessary acts of the government of Julian.
(53) Soon after his entrance into the palace of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> he had occasion for the service of a barber.
 An officer, magnificently dressed, immediately presented himself.
 He questioned the man concerning the profits of his employment, and was informed that, besides a large salary and some valuable perquisites, he enjoyed a daily allowance for <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> servants and as many horses.
 A thousand barbers, a thousand cupbearers, a thousand cooks, were distributed in the several offices of luxury; and the number of eunuchs could be compared only with the insects of a summer's day.
 (55) The monarch who resigned to his subjects the superiority of merit and virtue was distinguished by the oppressive magnificence of his dress, his table, his buildings, and his train.
 The stately palaces erected by <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and his sons were decorated with many-coloured marbles and ornaments of massy gold.
 The most exquisite dainties were procured to gratify their pride rather than their taste; birds of the most distant climates, fish from the most remote seas, fruits out of their natural season, <DATE>winter</DATE> roses, and <DATE>summer</DATE> snows.
 (56) The domestic crowd of the palace surpassed the expense of the legions; yet the smallest part of this costly multitude was subservient to the use, or even to the splendour, of the throne.
 The monarch was disgraced, and the people was injured, by the creation and sale of an infinite number of obscure and even titular employments; and the most worthless of mankind might purchase the privilege of being maintained, without the necessity of labour, from the public revenue.
 The waste of an enormous household, the increase of fees and perquisites, which were soon claimed as a lawful debt, and the bribes which they extorted from those who feared their enmity or solicited their favour, suddenly enriched these haughty menials.
 They abused their fortune, without considering their past or their future condition; and their rapine and venality could be equalled only by the extravagance of their dissipations.
 Their silken robes were embroidered with gold, their tables were served with delicacy and profusion; the houses which they built for their own use would have covered the farm of an ancient consul; and the most honourable citizens were obliged to dismount from their horses and respectfully to salute an eunuch whom they met on the public highway.
 The luxury of the palace excited the contempt and indignation of Julian, who usually slept on the ground, who yielded with reluctance to the indispensable calls of nature, and who placed his vanity not in emulating, but in despising the pomp of royalty.
 By the total extirpation of a mischief which was magnified even beyond its real extent, he was impatient to relieve the distress and to appease the murmurs of the people, who support with less uneasiness the weight of taxes if they are convinced that the fruits of their industry are appropriated to the service of the state.
 But in the execution of this salutary work <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> is accused of proceeding with too much haste and inconsiderable severity.
 By a single edict he reduced the palace of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to an immense desert, and dismissed with ignominy the whole train of slaves and dependents,(57) without providing any just, or at least benevolent, exceptions for the age, the services, or the poverty of the faithful domestics of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> family.
 Such indeed was the temper of Julian, who seldom recollected the fundamental maxim of Aristotle, that true virtue is placed at an equal distance between the opposite vices.
 The splendid and effeminate dress of the Asiatics, the curls and paint, the collars and bracelets, which had appeared so ridiculous in the person of Constantine, were consistently rejected by his philosophic successor.
 But with the fopperies <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> affected to renounce the decencies of dress; and seemed to value himself for his neglect of the laws of cleanliness.
 In a satirical performance, which was designed for the public eye, the emperor descants with pleasure, and even with pride, on the length of his nails and the inky blackness of his hands; protests that although the greatest part of his body was covered with hair, the use of the razor was confined to his head alone; and celebrates with visible complacency the shaggy and populous (58) beard which he fondly cherished, after the example of the philosophers of Greece.
 Had <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> consulted the simple dictates of reason, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> would have scorned the affectation of Diogenes, as well as that of Darius.
 Chamber of justice.
 But the work of public reformation would have remained imperfect if <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had only corrected the abuses, without punishing the crimes, of his predecessor's reign.
 To conduct this inquiry, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> named <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> judges of the highest rank in the state and army, and, as he wished to escape the reproach of condemning his personal enemies, he fixed this extraordinary tribunal at Chalcedon, on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> side of the Bosphorous, and transferred to the commissioners an absolute power to pronounce and execute their final sentence, without delay and without appeal.
 The office of president was exercised by the venerable praefect of the East, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Sallust, (60) whose virtues conciliated the esteem of <NORP>Greek</NORP> sophists and of <NORP>Christian</NORP> bishops.
 He was assisted by the eloquent Mamertinus,(61) <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the consuls elect, whose merit is loudly celebrated by the doubtful evidence of his own applause.
 But the civil wisdom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> magistrates was overbalanced by the ferocious violence of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> generals, Nevitta, Agilo, Jovinus, and Arbetio.
 Arbetio, whom the public would have seen with less surprise at the bar than on the bench, was supposed to possess the secret of the commission, the armed and angry leaders of the <NORP>Jovian</NORP> and <NORP>Herculian</NORP> bands encompassed the tribunal, and the judges were alternately swayed by the laws of justice and by the clamours of faction.
 (62) Punishment of the innocent and the guilty.
 The chamberlain Eusebius, who had so long abused the favour of Constantius, expiated, by an ignominious death, the insolence, the corruption, and cruelty of his servile reign.
 The executions of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> and <PERSON>Apodemius</PERSON> (the former of whom was burnt alive) were accepted as an inadequate atonement by the widows and orphans of so many hundred <NORP>Romans</NORP> whom those legal tyrants had betrayed and murdered.
 But Justice herself (if we may use the pathetic expression of Ammianus(63) ) appeared to weep over the fate of Ursulus, the treasurer of the empire, and his blood accused the ingratitude of Julian, whose distress had been seasonably relieved by the intrepid liberality of that honest minister.
 The rage of the soldiers, whom he had provoked by his indiscretion, was the cause and the excuse of his death; and the emperor, deeply wounded by his own reproaches and those of the public, offered some consolation to the family of <PERSON>Ursulus</PERSON> by the restitution of his confiscated fortunes.
 Before the end of the year in which they had been adorned with the ensigns of the prefecture and consulship,(64) <PERSON>Taurus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Florentius</PERSON> were reduced to implore the clemency of the inexorable tribunal of Chalcedon.
 The former was banished to <GPE>Vercellae</GPE> in Italy, and a sentence of death was pronounced against the latter.
 A wise prince should have rewarded the crime of Taurus: the faithful minister, when he was no longer able to oppose the progress of a rebel, had taken refuge in the court of his benefactor and his lawful sovereign.
 But the guilt of <PERSON>Florentius</PERSON> justified the severity of the judges, and his escape served to display the magnanimity of Julian, who nobly checked the interested diligence of an informer, and refused to learn what place concealed the wretched fugitive from his just resentment.
(65) Some months after the tribunal of <GPE>Chalcedon</GPE> had been dissolved, the praetorian vicegerent of Africa, the notary Gaudentius, and Artemius,(66) duke of Egypt, were executed at Antioch.
 <PERSON>Artemius</PERSON> had reigned the cruel and corrupt tyrant of a great province; <PERSON>Gaudentius</PERSON> had long practised the arts of calumny against the innocent, the virtuous, and even the person of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> himself.
 Yet the circumstances of their trial and condemnation were so unskilfully managed that these wicked men obtained, in the public opinion, the glory of suffering for the obstinate loyalty with which they had supported the cause of Constantius.
 The rest of his servants were protected by a general act of oblivion, and they were left to enjoy with impunity the bribes which they had accepted either to defend the oppressed or to oppress the friendless.
 This measure, which, on the soundest principles of policy, may deserve our approbation, was executed in a manner which seemed to degrade the majesty of the throne.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was tormented by the importunities of a multitude, particularly of Egyptians, who loudly redemanded the gifts which they had imprudently or illegally bestowed; he foresaw the endless prosecution of vexatious suits, and he engaged a promise, which ought always to have been sacred, that if they would repair to Chalcedon, he would meet them in person, to hear and determine their complaints.
 But as soon as they were landed, he issued an absolute order, which prohibited the watermen from transporting any <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> to Constantinople, and thus detained his disappointed clients on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore, till, their patience and money being utterly exhausted, they were obliged to return with indignant murmurs to their native country.
 (67) Clemency of Julian.
 The numerous army of spies, of agents, and informers, enlisted by <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> to secure the repose of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> man, and to interrupt that of millions, was immediately disbanded by his generous successor.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was slow in his suspicions, and gentle in his punishments, and his contempt of treason was the result of judgment, of vanity, and of courage.
 Conscious of superior merit, he was persuaded that few among his subjects would dare to meet him in the field, to attempt his life, or even to seat themselves on his vacant throne.
 The philosopher could excuse the hasty sallies of discontent, and the hero could despise the ambitious projects which surpassed the fortune or the abilities of the rash conspirators.
 A citizen of <PERSON>Ancyra</PERSON> had prepared for his own use a purple garment, and this indiscreet action, which, under the reign of Constantius, would have been considered as a capital offence, (68) was reported to <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> by the officious importunity of a private enemy.
 The monarch, after making some inquiry into the rank and character of his rival, despatched the informer with a present of a pair of purple slippers, to complete the magnificence of his <ORG>Imperial</ORG> habit.
 A more dangerous conspiracy was formed by <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> of the domestic guards, who had resolved to assassinate <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> in the field of exercise near Antioch.
 Their intemperance revealed their guilt, and they were conducted in chains to the presence of their injured sovereign, who, after a lively representation of the wickedness and folly of their enterprise, instead of a death of torture, which they deserved and expected, pronounced a sentence of exile against the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal offenders.
 The only instance in which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> seemed to depart from his accustomed clemency was the execution of a rash youth, who, with a feeble hand, had aspired to seize the reins of empire.
 But that youth was the son of Marcellus, the general of cavalry, who, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> campaign of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> war, had deserted the standard of the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and the republic.
 Without appearing to indulge his personal resentment, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> might easily confound the crime of the son and of the father; but he was reconciled by the distress of Marcellus, and the liberality of the emperor endeavoured to heal the wound which had been inflicted by the hand of justice.
(69) His love of freedom, and the republic.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was not insensible of the advantages of freedom.
(70) From his studies he had imbibed the spirit of ancient sages and heroes; his life and fortunes had depended on the caprice of a tyrant; and, when he ascended the throne, his pride was sometimes mortified by the reflection that the slaves who would not dare to censure his defects were not worthy to applaud his virtues.
(71) He sincerely abhorred the system of oriental despotism which Diocletian, Constantine, and the patient habits of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> score years, had established in the empire.
 A motive of superstition prevented the execution of the design which <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had frequently meditated, of relieving his head from the weight of a costly diadem;(72) but he absolutely refused the title of <PERSON>Dominus</PERSON> or Lord ,(73) a word which was grown so familiar to the ears of the Romans, that they no longer remembered its servile and humiliating origin.
 The office, or rather the name, of consul was cherished by a prince who contemplated with reverence the ruins of the republic; and the same behaviour which had been assumed by the prudence of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> was adopted by <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> from choice and inclination.
 On the calends of January, at break of day, the new consuls, <PERSON>Mamertinus</PERSON> and Nevitta, hastened to the palace to salute the emperor.
 As soon as he was informed of their approach, he leaped from his throne, eagerly advanced to meet them, and compelled the blushing magistrates to receive the demonstrations of his affected humility.
 From the palace they proceeded to the senate.
 The emperor, on foot, marched before their litters, and the gazing multitude admired the image of ancient times, or secretly blamed a conduct which, in their eyes, degraded the majesty of the purple.
(74) But the behaviour of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was uniformly supported.
 During the games of the Circus, he had, imprudently or designedly, performed the manumission of a slave in the presence of the consul.
 The moment he was reminded that he had trespassed on the jurisdiction of another magistrate, he condemned himself to pay a fine of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, and embraced this public occasion of declaring to the world that he was subject, like the rest of his fellow-citizens, to the laws, (75) and even to the forms, of the republic.
 The spirit of his administration, and his regard for the place of his nativity, induced <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> to confer on the senate of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> the same honours, privileges, and authority which were still enjoyed by the senate of ancient Rome.
(76) A legal fiction was introduced and gradually established, that <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> half of the national council had migrated into the East, and the despotic successors of Julian, accepting the title of Senators, acknowledged themselves the members of a respectable body which was permitted to represent the majesty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name.
 From <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> the attention of the monarch was extended to the municipal senates of the provinces.
 He abolished, by repeated edicts, the unjust and pernicious exemptions which had withdrawn so many idle citizens from the service of their country; His care of the <NORP>Graecian</NORP> cities and by imposing an equal distribution of public duties, he restored the strength, the splendour, or, according to the glowing expression of Libanius, (77) the soul of the expiring cities of his empire.
 The venerable age of <GPE>Greece</GPE> excited the most tender compassion in the mind of Julian, which kindled into rapture when he recollected the gods, the heroes, and the men superior to heroes and to gods, who had bequeathed to the latest posterity the monuments of their genius or the example of their virtues.
 He relieved the distress and restored the beauty of the cities of <ORG>Epirus</ORG> and Peloponnesus.
(78) <GPE>Athens</GPE> acknowledged him for her benefactor, <ORG>Argos</ORG> for her deliverer.
 The pride of Corinth, again rising from her ruins with the honours of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> colony, exacted a tribute from the adjacent republics for the purpose of defraying the games of the Isthmus, which were celebrated in the amphitheatre with the hunting of bears and panthers.
 From this tribute the cities of Elis, of Delphi, and of Argos, which had inherited from their remote ancestors the sacred office of perpetuating the Olympic, the Pythian, and the <NORP>Nemean</NORP> games, claimed a just exemption The immunity of <PERSON>Elis</PERSON> and <ORG>Delphi</ORG> was respected by the Corinthians, but the poverty of <ORG>Argos</ORG> tempted the insolence of oppression, and the feeble complaints of its deputies were silenced by the decree of a provincial magistrate, who seems to have consulted only the interest of the capital in which he resided.
 Seven years after this sentence Julian(79) allowed the cause to be referred to a superior tribunal, and his eloquence was interposed, most probably with success, in the defence of a city which had been the royal seat of Agamemnon,(80) and had given to <GPE>Macedonia</GPE> a race of kings and conquerors.
(81) Julian, an orator and a judge.
 The laborious administration of military and civil affairs, which were multiplied in proportion to the extent of the empire, exercised the abilities of Julian; but he frequently assumed the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> characters of <PERSON>Orator</PERSON> (82) and of Judge,(83) which are almost unknown to the modern sovereigns of Europe.
 The arts of persuasion, so diligently cultivated by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Caesars, were neglected by the military ignorance and <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> pride of their successors, and, if they condescended to harangue the soldiers, whom they feared, they treated with silent disdain the senators, whom they despised.
 The assemblies of the senate, which <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> had avoided, were considered by <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> as the place where he could exhibit with the most propriety the maxims of a <NORP>republican</NORP> and the talents of a rhetorician.
 He alternately practised, as in a school of declamation, the several modes of praise, of censure, of exhortation; and his friend <PERSON>Libanius</PERSON> has remarked that the study of <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> taught him to imitate the simple, concise style of Menelaus, the copiousness of Nestor, whose words descended like the flakes of a winter's snow, or the pathetic and forcible eloquence of Ulysses.
 The functions of a judge, which are sometimes incompatible with those of a prince, were exercised by <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> not only as a duty, but as an amusement; and although he might have trusted the integrity and discernment of his <NORP>Braetorian</NORP> praefects, he often placed himself by their side on the seat of judgment.
 The acute penetration of his mind was agreeably occupied in detecting and defeating the chicanery of the advocates, who laboured to disguise the truth of facts and to pervert the sense of the laws.
 He sometimes forgot the gravity of his station, asked indiscreet or unseasonable questions, and betrayed, by the loudness of his voice and the agitation of his body, the earnest vehemence with which he maintained his opinion against the judges, the advocates, and their clients.
 But his knowledge of his own temper prompted him to encourage, and even to solicit, the reproof of his friends and ministers: and whenever they ventured to oppose the irregular sallies of his passions, the spectators could observe the shame as well as the gratitude of their monarch.
 The decrees of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were almost always founded on the principles of justice, and he had the firmness to resist the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most dangerous temptations which assault the tribunal of a sovereign under the specious forms of compassion and equity.
 He decided the merits of the cause without weighing the circumstances of the parties; and the poor, whom he wished to relieve, were condemned to satisfy the just demands of a noble and wealthy adversary.
 He carefully distinguished the judge from the legislator;(84) and though he meditated a necessary reformation of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence, he pronounced sentence according to the strict and literal interpretation of those laws which the magistrates were bound to execute and the subjects to obey.
 His character.
 The generality of princes, if they were stripped of their purple and cast naked into the world, would immediately sink to the lowest rank of society, without a hope of emerging from their obscurity.
 But the personal merit of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was, in some measure, independent of his fortune.
 Whatever had been his choice of life, by the force of intrepid courage, lively wit, and intense application, he would have obtained, or at least he would have deserved, the highest honours of his profession, and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> might have raised himself to the rank of minister or general of the state in which he was born a private citizen.
 If the jealous caprice of power had disappointed his expectations; if he had prudently declined the paths of greatness, the employment of the same talents in studious solitude would have placed beyond the reach of kings his present happiness and his immortal fame.
 When we inspect with minute, or perhaps malevolent, attention the portrait of Julian, something seems wanting to the grace and perfection of the whole figure.
 His genius was less powerful and sublime than that of Caesar, nor did he possess the consummate prudence of Augustus.
 The virtues of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> appear more steady and natural, and the philosophy of <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> is more simple and consistent.
 Yet <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> sustained adversity with firmness, and prosperity with moderation.
 After an interval of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years from the death of Alexander Severus, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> beheld an emperor who made no distinction between his duties and his pleasures, who laboured to relieve the distress and to revive the spirit of his subjects, and who endeavoured always to connect authority with merit, and happiness with virtue.
 Even faction, and religious faction, was constrained to acknowledge the superiority of his genius in peace as well as in war, and to con fess, with a sigh, that the apostate <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was a lover of his country, and that he deserved the empire of the world.
