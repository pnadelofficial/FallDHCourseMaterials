 Embassy of the younger <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> to pope <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> XII.
 A.
D.
 1339.
 In the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> last centuries of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors, their friendly or hostile aspect towards the pope and the <NORP>Latins</NORP> may be observed as the thermometer of their prosperity or distress; as the scale of the rise and fall of the <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> dynasties.
 When the <NORP>Turks</NORP> of the house of <GPE>Seljuk</GPE> pervaded Asia, and threatened Constantinople, we have seen, at the council of Placentia, the suppliant ambassadors of <GPE>Alexius</GPE> imploring the protection of the common father of the Christians.
 No sooner had the arms of the <NORP>French</NORP> pilgrims removed the sultan from <GPE>Nice</GPE> to Iconium, than the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes resumed, or avowed, their genuine hatred and contempt for the schismatics of the West, which precipitated the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> downfall of their empire.
 The date of the Mogul invasion is marked in the soft and charitable language of <PERSON>John</PERSON> Vataces.
 After the recovery of Constantinople, the throne of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> was encompassed by foreign and domestic enemies; as long as the sword of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> was suspended over his head, he basely courted the favour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff; and sacrificed to the present danger his faith, his virtue, and the affection of his subjects.
 On the decease of Michael, the prince and people asserted the independence of their church, and the purity of their creed: the elder <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> neither feared nor loved the Latins; in his last distress, pride was the safeguard of superstition; nor could he decently retract in his age the firm and orthodox declarations of his youth.
 His grandson, the younger Andronicus, was less a slave in his temper and situation; and the conquest of <PERSON>Bithynia</PERSON> by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> admonished him to seek a temporal and spiritual alliance with the <NORP>Western</NORP> princes.
 After a separation and silence of fifty years, a secret agent, the monk Barlaam, was despatched to <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> the Twelfth; and his artful instructions appear to have been drawn by the master-hand of the great domestic.
 (1)The arguments for a crusade and union.
If the suspicious <NORP>Latins</NORP> should require some pledge, some previous effect of the sincerity of the Greeks, the answers of <PERSON>Barlaam</PERSON> were perspicuous and rational.
 "1.
 A general synod can alone consummate the union of the churches; nor can such a synod be held till the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <NORP>Oriental</NORP> patriarchs, and a great number of bishops, are enfranchised from the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> yoke.
 2.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> are alienated by a long series of oppression and injury: they must be reconciled by some act of brotherly love, some effectual succour, which may fortify the authority and arguments of the emperor, and the friends of the union.
 3.
 If some difference of faith or ceremonies should be found incurable, the Greeks, however, are the disciples of Christ; and the <NORP>Turks</NORP> are the common enemies of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> name.
 The Armenians, Cyprians, and Rhodians, are equally attacked; and it will become the piety of the <NORP>French</NORP> princes to draw their swords in the general defence of religion.
 4.
 Should the subjects of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> be treated as the worst of schismatics, of heretics, of pagans, a judicious policy may yet instruct the powers of the <LOC>West</LOC> to embrace a useful ally, to uphold a sinking empire, to guard the confines of Europe; and rather to join the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> against the Turks, than to expect the union of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> arms with the troops and treasures of captive Greece.
" The reasons, the offers, and the demands, of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> were eluded with cold and stately indifference.
 The kings of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>Naples</GPE> declined the dangers and glory of a crusade; the pope refused to call a new synod to determine old articles of faith; and his regard for the obsolete claims of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> emperor and clergy engaged him to use an offensive superscription, â€” "To the moderator (2) of the Greeks, and the persons who style themselves the patriarchs of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> churches.
" For such an embassy, a time and character less propitious could not easily have been found.
 <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> the Twelfth (3) was a dull peasant, perplexed with scruples, and immersed in sloth and wine: his pride might enrich with a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> crown the papal tiara, but he was alike unfit for the regal and the pastoral office.
 Negotiations of <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> with <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> VI.
 A.
D.
 1348.
 After the decease of Andronicus, while the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were distracted by intestine war, they could not presume to agitate a general union of the Christians.
 But as soon as <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> had subdued and pardoned his enemies, he was anxious to justify, or at least to extenuate, the introduction of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> into Europe, and the nuptials of his daughter with a <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> prince.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> officers of state, with a <NORP>Latin</NORP> interpreter, were sent in his name to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> court, which was transplanted to Avignon, on the banks of the Rhone, during a period of seventy years: they represented the hard necessity which had urged him to embrace the alliance of the miscreants, and pronounced by his command the specious and edifying sounds of union and crusade.
 <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Sixth, (4) the successor of Benedict, received them with hospitality and honour, acknowledged the innocence of their sovereign, excused his distress, applauded his magnanimity, and displayed a clear knowledge of the state and revolutions of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire, which he had imbibed from the honest accounts of a <NORP>Savoyard</NORP> lady, an attendant of the empress Anne.
 (5) If <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> was ill endowed with the virtues of a priest, he possessed, however, the spirit and magnificence of a prince, whose liberal hand distributed benefices and kingdoms with equal facility.
 Under his reign <GPE>Avignon</GPE> was the seat of pomp and pleasure: in his youth he had surpassed the licentiousness of a baron; and the palace, nay, the bed-chamber of the pope, was adorned, or polluted, by the visits of his female favourites.
 The wars of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>England</GPE> were adverse to the holy enterprise; but his vanity was amused by the splendid idea; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> ambassadors returned with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Latin</NORP> bishops, the ministers of the pontiff.
 On their arrival at Constantinople, the emperor and the nuncios admired each other's piety and eloquence; and their frequent conferences were filled with mutual praises and promises, by which both parties were amused, and neither could be deceived.
 Yet the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor presumed to observe, that the articles of faith which divided the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches had been introduced by the pride and precipitation of the Latins: he disclaimed the servile and arbitrary steps of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Palaeologus; and firmly declared, that he would never submit his conscience unless to the decrees of a free and universal synod.
 The nuncios seemed content with the proposition; and <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> affects to deplore the failure of his hopes, which were soon overthrown by the death of Clement, and the different temper of his successor.
 His own life was prolonged, but it was prolonged in a cloister; and, except by his prayers, the humble monk was incapable of directing the counsels of his pupil or the state.
 (6) treaty of <PERSON>John</PERSON> <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> I.
 With Innocent VI.
 A.
D.
 1355.
 Yet of all the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> princes, that pupil, <PERSON>John</PERSON> Palaeologus, was the best disposed to embrace, to believe, and to obey, the shepherd of the West.
 His mother, <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> of Savoy, was baptized in the bosom of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church: her marriage with <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> imposed a change of name, of apparel, and of worship, but her heart was still faithful to her country and religion: she had formed the infancy of her son, and she governed the emperor, after his mind, or at least his stature, was enlarged to the size of man.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> year of his deliverance and restoration, the <NORP>Turks</NORP> were still masters of the Hellespont; the son of <PERSON>Cantacuzene</PERSON> was in arms at Adrianople; and <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> could depend neither on himself nor on his people.
 By his mother's advice, and in the hope of foreign aid, he abjured the rights both of the church and state; and the act of slavery, (7) subscribed in purple ink, and sealed with the golden bull, was privately entrusted to an <NORP>Italian</NORP> agent.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> article of the treaty is an oath of fidelity and obedience to Innocent the <ORDINAL>Sixth</ORDINAL> and his successors, the supreme pontiffs of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> and <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 The emperor promises to entertain with due reverence their legates and nuncios; to assign a palace for their residence, and a temple for their worship; and to deliver his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> as the hostage of his faith.
 For these condescensions he requires a prompt succour of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> galleys, with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> men at arms, and a thousand archers, to serve against his <NORP>Christian</NORP> and <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> enemies.
 <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> engages to impose on his clergy and people the same spiritual yoke; but as the resistance of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> might be justly foreseen, he adopts the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> effectual methods of corruption and education.
 The legate was empowered to distribute the vacant benefices among the ecclesiastics who should subscribe the creed of the Vatican: <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> schools were instituted to instruct the youth of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> in the language and doctrine of the Latins; and the name of Andronicus, the heir of the empire, was enrolled as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> student.
 Should he fail in the measures of persuasion or force, <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> declares himself unworthy to reign; transferred to the pope all regal and paternal authority; and invests Innocent with full power to regulate the family, the government, and the marriage, of his son and successor.
 But this treaty was neither executed nor published: the <NORP>Roman</NORP> galleys were as vain and imaginary as the submission of the Greeks; and it was only by the secrecy that their sovereign escaped the dishonour of this fruitless humiliation.
 Visit of <PERSON>John</PERSON> <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> to <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> V.
 at Rome, A.
D.
 1369, October <CARDINAL>13</CARDINAL> etc.
 The tempest of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> arms soon burst on his head; and after the loss of <GPE>Adrianople</GPE> and Romania, he was enclosed in his capital, the vassal of the haughty Amurath, with the miserable hope of being the last devoured by the savage.
 In this abject state, <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> embraced the resolution of embarking for Venice, and casting himself at the feet of the pope: he was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> princes who had ever visited the unknown regions of the West, yet in them alone he could seek consolation or relief; and with less violation of his dignity he might appear in the sacred college than at the Ottoman Porte.
 After a long absence, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiffs were returning from <GPE>Avignon</GPE> to the banks of the Tyber: <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the Fifth, (8) of a mild and virtuous character, encouraged or allowed the pilgrimage of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> prince; and, within the same year, enjoyed the glory of receiving in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Imperial</NORP> shadows who represented the majesty of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 In this suppliant visit, the emperor of Constantinople, whose vanity was lost in his distress, gave more than could be expected of empty sounds and formal submissions.
 A previous trial was imposed; and, in the presence of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> cardinals, he acknowledged, as a true Catholic, the supremacy of the pope, and the double procession of the Holy Ghost.
 After this purification, he was introduced to a public audience in the church of St.
 Peter: Urban, in the midst of the cardinals, was seated on his throne; the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarch, after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> genuflections, devoutly kissed the feet, the hands, and at length the mouth, of the holy father, who celebrated high mass in his presence, allowed him to lead the bridle of his mule, and treated him with a sumptuous banquet in the Vatican.
 The entertainment of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> was friendly and honourable; yet some difference was observed between the emperors of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West; (9) nor could the former be entitled to the rare privilege of chanting the gospel in the rank of a deacon.
 (10) In favour of his proselyte, <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> strove to rekindle the zeal of the <NORP>French</NORP> king and the other powers of the West; but he found them cold in the general cause, and active only in their domestic quarrels.
 The last hope of the emperor was in an <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> mercenary, <PERSON>John</PERSON> Hawkwood, (11) or Acuto, who, with a band of adventurers, the white brotherhood, had ravaged <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to Calabria; sold his services to the hostile states; and incurred a just excommunication by shooting his arrows against the papal residence.
 A special license was granted to negotiate with the outlaw, but the forces, or the spirit, of Hawkwood, were unequal to the enterprise: and it was for the advantage, perhaps, of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> to be disappointed of succour, that must have been costly, that could not be effectual, and which might have been dangerous.
 (12) The disconsolate <NORP>Greek</NORP> (13) prepared for his return, but even his return was impeded by a most ignominious obstacle.
 On his arrival at Venice, he had borrowed large sums at exorbitant usury; but his coffers were empty, his creditors were impatient, and his person was detained as the best security for the payment.
 His eldest son, Andronicus, the regent of Constantinople, was repeatedly urged to exhaust every resource; and even by stripping the churches, to extricate his father from captivity and disgrace.
 But the unnatural youth was insensible of the disgrace, and secretly pleased with the captivity of the emperor: the state was poor, the clergy were obstinate; nor could some religious scruple be wanting to excuse the guilt of his indifference and delay.
 Such undutiful neglect was severely reproved by the piety of his brother Manuel, who instantly sold or mortgaged all that he possessed, embarked for Venice, relieved his father, and pledged his own freedom to be responsible for the debt.
 His return to Constantinople, A.
D.
 1370.
 On his return to Constantinople, the parent and king distinguished his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons with suitable rewards; but the faith and manners of the slothful <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> had not been improved by his <NORP>Roman</NORP> pilgrimage; and his apostasy or conversion, devoid of any spiritual or temporal effects, was speedily forgotten by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins.
 (14) Visit of emperor Manuel.
 Thirty years after the return of Palaeologus, his son and successor, Manuel, from a similar motive, but on a larger scale, again visited the countries of the West.
 In a preceding chapter I have related his treaty with Bajazet, the violation of that treaty, the siege or blockade of Constantinople, and the <NORP>French</NORP> succour under the command of the gallant Boucicault.
 (15) By his ambassadors, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had solicited the <NORP>Latin</NORP> powers; but it was thought that the presence of a distressed monarch would draw tears and supplies from the hardest Barbarians; (16) and the marshal who advised the journey prepared the reception of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> prince.
 The land was occupied by the Turks; but the navigation of <GPE>Venice</GPE> was safe and open: <GPE>Italy</GPE> received him as the first, or, at least, as the second, of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes; <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was pitied as the champion and confessor of the faith; and the dignity of his behaviour prevented that pity from sinking into contempt.
 From <GPE>Venice</GPE> he proceeded to <GPE>Padua</GPE> and Pavia; and even the duke of Milan, a secret ally of Bajazet, gave him safe and honourable conduct to the verge of his dominions.
 (17) to the court of France.
 A.
D.
 1400, June 3; On the confines of <GPE>France</GPE> (18) the royal officers undertook the care of his person, journey, and expenses; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand of the richest citizens, in arms and on horseback, came forth to meet him as far as Charenton, in the neighbourhood of the capital.
 At the gates of Paris, he was saluted by the chancellor and the parliament; and <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the Sixth, attended by his princes and nobles, welcomed his brother with a cordial embrace.
 The successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was clothed in a robe of white silk, and mounted on a milk-white steed, a circumstance, in the <NORP>French</NORP> ceremonial, of singular importance: the white colour is considered as the symbol of sovereignty; and, in a late visit, the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, after a haughty demand and a peevish refusal, had been reduced to content himself with a black courser.
 <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was lodged in the Louvre; a succession of feasts and balls, the pleasures of the banquet and the chase, were ingeniously varied by the politeness of the French, to display their magnificence, and amuse his grief: he was indulged in the liberty of his chapel; and the doctors of the <FAC>Sorbonne</FAC> were astonished, and possibly scandalized, by the language, the rites, and the vestments, of his <NORP>Greek</NORP> clergy.
 But the slightest glance on the state of the kingdom must teach him to despair of any effectual assistance.
 The unfortunate Charles, though he enjoyed some lucid intervals, continually relapsed into furious or stupid insanity: the reins of government were alternately seized by his brother and uncle, the dukes of <GPE>Orleans</GPE> and Burgundy, whose factious competition prepared the miseries of civil war.
 The former was a gay youth, dissolved in luxury and love: the latter was the father of <PERSON>John</PERSON> count of Nevers, who had so lately been ransomed from <NORP>Turkish</NORP> captivity; and, if the fearless son was ardent to revenge his defeat, the more prudent <GPE>Burgundy</GPE> was content with the cost and peril of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> experiment.
 When <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had satiated the curiosity, and perhaps fatigued the patience, of the French, he resolved on a visit to the adjacent island.
 of England.
 A.
D.
 1400, December.
 In his progress from Dover, he was entertained at <GPE>Canterbury</GPE> with due reverence by the prior and monks of St.
 Austin; and, on Blackheath, King <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Fourth, with the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> court, saluted the <NORP>Greek</NORP> hero, (I copy our old historian,) who, during many days, was lodged and treated in <GPE>London</GPE> as emperor of the East.
 (19) But the state of <GPE>England</GPE> was still more adverse to the design of the holy war.
 In the same year, the hereditary sovereign had been deposed and murdered: the reigning prince was a successful usurper, whose ambition was punished by jealousy and remorse: nor could <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> of <GPE>Lancaster</GPE> withdraw his person or forces from the defence of a throne incessantly shaken by conspiracy and rebellion.
 He pitied, he praised, he feasted, the emperor of Constantinople; but if the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> monarch assumed the cross, it was only to appease his people, and perhaps his conscience, by the merit or semblance of his pious intention.
 (20) Satisfied, however, with gifts and honours, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> returned to Paris; His return to Greece.
 A.
D.
 1402.
 and, after a residence of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years in the West, shaped his course through <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, embarked at Venice, and patiently expected, in the Morea, the moment of his ruin or deliverance.
 Yet he had escaped the ignominious necessity of offering his religion to public or private sale.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> church was distracted by the great schism; the kings, the nations, the universities, of <LOC>Europe</LOC> were divided in their obedience between the popes of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Avignon; and the emperor, anxious to conciliate the friendship of both parties, abstained from any correspondence with the indigent and unpopular rivals.
 His journey coincided with the year of the jubilee; but he passed through <GPE>Italy</GPE> without desiring, or deserving, the plenary indulgence which abolished the guilt or penance of the sins of the faithful.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> pope was offended by this neglect; accused him of irreverence to an image of Christ; and exhorted the princes of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reject and abandon the obstinate schismatic.
 (21) <NORP>Greek</NORP> knowledge and descriptions During the period of the crusades, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> beheld with astonishment and terror the perpetual stream of emigration that flowed, and continued to flow, from the unknown climates of their West.
 The visits of their last emperors removed the veil of separation, and they disclosed to their eyes the powerful nations of Europe, whom they no longer presumed to brand with the name of Barbarians.
 The observations of Manuel, and his more inquisitive followers, have been preserved by a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian of the times: (22) his scattered ideas I shall collect and abridge; and it may be amusing enough, perhaps instructive, to contemplate the rude pictures of Germany, France, and England, whose ancient and modern state are so familiar to our minds.
 I.
 <GPE>GERMANY</GPE> (says the <NORP>Greek</NORP> Chalcondyles) is of ample latitude from <GPE>Vienna</GPE> to the ocean; and it stretches (a strange geography) from <GPE>Prague</GPE> in <GPE>Bohemia</GPE> to the River Tartessus, and the Pyrenaean Mountains.
 (23) The soil, except in figs and olives, is sufficiently fruitful; the air is salubrious; the bodies of the natives are robust and healthy; and these cold regions are seldom visited with the calamities of pestilence, or earthquakes.
 After the <NORP>Scythians</NORP> or Tartars, the <NORP>Germans</NORP> are the most numerous of nations: they are brave and patient; and were they united under a single head, their force would be irresistible.
 By the gift of the pope, they have acquired the privilege of choosing the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor; (24) nor is any people more devoutly attached to the faith and obedience of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> patriarch.
 The greatest part of the country is divided among the princes and prelates; but Strasburg, Cologne, Hamburgh, and more than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> free cities, are governed by sage and equal laws, according to the will, and for the advantage, of the whole community.
 The use of duels, or single combats on foot, prevails among them in peace and war: their industry excels in all the mechanic arts; and the <NORP>Germans</NORP> may boast of the invention of gunpowder and cannon, which is now diffused over the greatest part of the world.
 II.
 The kingdom of <GPE>FRANCE</GPE> is spread above <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> days' journey from <GPE>Germany</GPE> to Spain, and from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to the <NORP>British</NORP> Ocean; containing many flourishing cities, and among these Paris, the seat of the king, which surpasses the rest in riches and luxury.
 Many princes and lords alternately wait in his palace, and acknowledge him as their sovereign: the most powerful are the dukes of <GPE>Bretagne</GPE> and Burgundy; of whom the latter possesses the wealthy province of Flanders, whose harbours are frequented by the ships and merchants of our own, and the more remote, seas.
 The <NORP>French</NORP> are an ancient and opulent people; and their language and manners, though somewhat different, are not dissimilar from those of the Italians.
 Vain of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity of Charlemagne, of their victories over the Saracens, and of the exploits of their heroes, <PERSON>Oliver</PERSON> and Rowland, (25) they esteem themselves the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the western nations; but this foolish arrogance has been recently humbled by the unfortunate events of their wars against the English, the inhabitants of the <NORP>British</NORP> island.
 III.
 BRITAIN, in the ocean, and opposite to the shores of Flanders, may be considered either as one, or as <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> islands; but the whole is united by a common interest, by the same manners, and by a similar government.
 The measure of its circumference is <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> thousand stadia: the land is overspread with towns and villages: though destitute of wine, and not abounding in fruit-trees, it is fertile in wheat and barley; in honey and wool; and much cloth is manufactured by the inhabitants.
 In populousness and power, in richness and luxury, London, (26) the metropolis of the isle, may claim a preeminence over all the cities of the West.
 It is situate on the Thames, a broad and rapid river, which at the distance of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> miles falls into the Gallic Sea; and the <DATE>daily</DATE> flow and ebb of the tide affords a safe entrance and departure to the vessels of commerce.
 The king is head of a powerful and turbulent aristocracy: his principal vassals hold their estates by a free and unalterable tenure; and the laws define the limits of his authority and their obedience.
 The kingdom has been often afflicted by foreign conquest and domestic sedition: but the natives are bold and hardy, renowned in arms and victorious in war.
 The form of their shields or targets is derived from the Italians, that of their swords from the Greeks; the use of the long bow is the peculiar and decisive advantage of the English.
 Their language bears no affinity to the idioms of the Continent: in the habits of domestic life, they are not easily distinguished from their neighbours of France: but the most singular circumstance of their manners is their disregard of conjugal honour and of female chastity.
 In their mutual visits, as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of hospitality, the guest is welcomed in the embraces of their wives and daughters: among friends they are lent and borrowed without shame; nor are the islanders offended at this strange commerce, and its inevitable consequences.
 (27) Informed as we are of the customs of Old <GPE>England</GPE> and assured of the virtue of our mothers, we may smile at the credulity, or resent the injustice, of the Greek, who must have confounded a modest salute (28) with a criminal embrace.
 But his credulity and injustice may teach an important lesson; to distrust the accounts of foreign and remote nations, and to suspend our belief of every tale that deviates from the laws of nature and the character of man.
 (29) Indifference of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> towards the Latins, A.
D.
 1402-1417.
 After his return, and the victory of Timour, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> reigned many years in prosperity and peace.
 As long as the sons of <PERSON>Bajazet</PERSON> solicited his friendship and spared his dominions, he was satisfied with the national religion; and his leisure was employed in composing <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> theological dialogues for its defence.
 The appearance of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> ambassadors at the council of Constance, (30) announces the restoration of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> power, as well as of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church: the conquest of the sultans, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> and Amurath, reconciled the emperor to the Vatican; and the siege of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> almost tempted him to acquiesce in the double procession of the Holy Ghost.
 When <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> ascended without a rival the chair of St.
 Peter, a friendly intercourse of letters and embassies was revived between the <LOC>East</LOC> and West.
 His negotiations.
 A.
D.
 1417-1425.
 Ambition on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> side, and distress on the other, dictated the same decent language of charity and peace: the artful <NORP>Greek</NORP> expressed a desire of marrying his <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> sons to <NORP>Italian</NORP> princesses; and the Roman, not less artful, despatched the daughter of the marquis of Montferrat, with a company of noble virgins, to soften, by their charms, the obstinacy of the schismatics.
 Yet under this mask of zeal, a discerning eye will perceive that all was hollow and insincere in the court and church of Constantinople.
 According to the vicissitudes of danger and repose, the emperor advanced or retreated; alternately instructed and disavowed his ministers; and escaped from the importunate pressure by urging the duty of inquiry, the obligation of collecting the sense of his patriarchs and bishops, and the impossibility of convening them at a time when the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> arms were at the gates of his capital.
 From a review of the public transactions it will appear that the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> insisted on <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> successive measures, a succour, a council, and a final reunion, while the <NORP>Latins</NORP> eluded the second, and only promised the first, as a consequential and voluntary reward of the third.
 But we have an opportunity of unfolding the most secret intentions of Manuel, as he explained them in a private conversation without artifice or disguise.
 His private motives.
 In his declining age, the emperor had associated <PERSON>John</PERSON> Palaeologus, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> of the name, and the eldest of his sons, on whom he devolved the greatest part of the authority and weight of government.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> day, in the presence only of the historian Phranza, (31) his favourite chamberlain, he opened to his colleague and successor the true principle of his negotiations with the pope.
 (32) Impatient of this salutary lesson, the royal youth arose from his seat, and departed in silence; and the wise monarch (continued Phranza) casting his eyes on me, thus resumed his discourse: Yet the experience and authority of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> preserved the peace, and eluded the council; His death.
 till, in the seventy-eighth year of his age, and in the habit of a monk, he terminated his career, dividing his precious movables among his children and the poor, his physicians and his favourite servants.
 Of his <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> sons, (33) <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> was invested with the principality of Thessalonica, and died of a leprosy soon after the sale of that city to the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> and its final conquest by the Turks.
 Some fortunate incidents had restored Peloponnesus, or the Morea, to the empire; and in his more prosperous days, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had fortified the narrow isthmus of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> miles (34) with a stone wall and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty-three towers.
 The wall was overthrown by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> blast of the Ottomans; the fertile peninsula might have been sufficient for the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> younger brothers, <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> and Constantine, <PERSON>Demetrius</PERSON> and Thomas; but they wasted in domestic contests the remains of their strength; and the least successful of the rivals were reduced to a life of dependence in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace.
 Zeal of <PERSON>John</PERSON> <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> II.
 A.
D.
 1425-1437.
 The eldest of the sons of Manuel, <PERSON>John</PERSON> <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> the Second, was acknowledged, after his father's death, as the sole emperor of the Greeks.
 He immediately proceeded to repudiate his wife, and to contract a new marriage with the princess of Trebizond: beauty was in his eyes the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> qualification of an empress; and the clergy had yielded to his firm assurance, that unless he might be indulged in a divorce, he would retire to a cloister, and leave the throne to his brother Constantine.
 The first, and in truth the only, victory of Palaeologus, was over a Jew, (35) whom, after a long and learned dispute, he converted to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith; and this momentous conquest is carefully recorded in the history of the times.
 But he soon resumed the design of uniting the <LOC>East</LOC> and West; and, regardless of his father's advice, listened, as it should seem with sincerity, to the proposal of meeting the pope in a general council beyond the Adriatic.
 This dangerous project was encouraged by <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> the Fifth, and coldly entertained by his successor Eugenius, till, after a tedious negotiation, the emperor received a summons from the <NORP>Latin</NORP> assembly of a new character, the independent prelates of Basil, who styled themselves the representatives and judges of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 Corruption of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff had fought and conquered in the cause of ecclesiastical freedom; but the victorious clergy were soon exposed to the tyranny of their deliverer; and his sacred character was invulnerable to those arms which they found so keen and effectual against the civil magistrate.
 Their great charter, the right of election, was annihilated by appeals, evaded by trusts or commendams, disappointed by reversionary grants, and superseded by previous and arbitrary reservations.
 (36) A public auction was instituted in the court of Rome: the cardinals and favourites were enriched with the spoils of nations; and every country might complain that the most important and valuable benefices were accumulated on the heads of aliens and absentees.
 During their residence at Avignon, the ambition of the popes subsided in the meaner passions of avarice (37) and luxury: they rigorously imposed on the clergy the tributes of first-fruits and tenths; but they freely tolerated the impunity of vice, disorder, and corruption.
 Schism, A.
D.
 1377-1429.
 These manifold scandals were aggravated by the great schism of the West, which continued above fifty years.
 In the furious conflicts of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Avignon, the vices of the rivals were mutually exposed; and their precarious situation degraded their authority, relaxed their discipline, and multiplied their wants and exactions.
 To heal the wounds, and restore the monarchy, of the church, the synods of Council of Pisa, A.
D.
 1409.
 <GPE>Pisa</GPE> and A.
D.
 1414-1418.
 <PERSON>Constance</PERSON> (38) were successively convened; but these great assemblies, conscious of their strength, resolved to vindicate the privileges of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aristocracy.
 From a personal sentence against <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> pontiffs, whom they rejected, and a third, their acknowledged sovereign, whom they deposed, the fathers of <PERSON>Constance</PERSON> proceeded to examine the nature and limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> supremacy; nor did they separate till they had established the authority, above the pope, of a general council.
 It was enacted, that, for the government and reformation of the church, such assemblies should be held at regular intervals; and that each synod, before its dissolution, should appoint the time and place of the subsequent meeting.
 By the influence of the court of Rome, the next convocation at <GPE>Sienna</GPE> was easily eluded; but the bold and vigorous proceedings of of Basil, A.
D.
 <DATE>1431-1443</DATE> the council of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> (39) had almost been fatal to the reigning pontiff, <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> the Fourth.
 A just suspicion of his design prompted the fathers to hasten the promulgation of their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> decree, that the representatives of the church-militant on earth were invested with a divine and spiritual jurisdiction over all Christians, without excepting the pope; and that a general council could not be dissolved, prorogued, or transferred, unless by their free deliberation and consent.
 Their opposition to <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> IV.
 On the notice that <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> had fulminated a bull for that purpose, they ventured to summon, to admonish, to threaten, to censure the contumacious successor of St.
 Peter.
 After many delays, to allow time for repentance, they finally declared, that, unless he submitted within the term of sixty days, he was suspended from the exercise of all temporal and ecclesiastical authority.
 And to mark their jurisdiction over the prince as well as the priest, they assumed the government of Avignon, annulled the alienation of the sacred patrimony, and protected <GPE>Rome</GPE> from the imposition of new taxes.
 Their boldness was justified, not only by the general opinion of the clergy, but by the support and power of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> monarchs of Christendom: the emperor <PERSON>Sigismond</PERSON> declared himself the servant and protector of the synod; <GPE>Germany</GPE> and <GPE>France</GPE> adhered to their cause; the duke of <GPE>Milan</GPE> was the enemy of Eugenius; and he was driven from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> by an insurrection of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Rejected at the same time by temporal and spiritual subjects, submission was his only choice: by a most humiliating bull, the pope repealed his own acts, and ratified those of the council; incorporated his legates and cardinals with that venerable body; and seemed to resign himself to the decrees of the supreme legislature.
 Their fame pervaded the countries of the East: and it was in their presence that <PERSON>Sigismond</PERSON> received the ambassadors of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan, (40) who laid at his feet <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> large vases, filled with robes of silk and pieces of gold.
 Negotiations with the Greeks, A.
D.
 1434-1437.
 The fathers of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> aspired to the glory of reducing the Greeks, as well as the Bohemians, within the pale of the church; and their deputies invited the emperor and patriarch of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to unite with an assembly which possessed the confidence of the <NORP>Western</NORP> nations.
 <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> was not averse to the proposal; and his ambassadors were introduced with due honours into the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> senate.
 But the choice of the place appeared to be an insuperable obstacle, since he refused to pass the Alps, or the sea of Sicily, and positively required that the synod should be adjourned to some convenient city in Italy, or at least on the Danube.
 The other articles of this treaty were more readily stipulated: it was agreed to defray the travelling expenses of the emperor, with a train of seven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> persons, (41) to remit an immediate sum of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> thousand ducats (42) for the accommodation of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> clergy; and in his absence to grant a supply of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand ducats, with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> archers and some galleys, for the protection of Constantinople.
 The city of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> advanced the funds for the preliminary expenses; and the embarkation was prepared at <GPE>Marseilles</GPE> with some difficulty and delay.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> embarks in the pope's gallies, A.
D.
 1437, Nov 24.
 In his distress, the friendship of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> was disputed by the ecclesiastical powers of the West; but the dexterous activity of a monarch prevailed over the slow debates and inflexible temper of a republic.
 The decrees of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> continually tended to circumscribe the despotism of the pope, and to erect a supreme and perpetual tribunal in the church.
 <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> was impatient of the yoke; and the union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> might afford a decent pretence for translating a rebellious synod from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Po.
 The independence of the fathers was lost if they passed the Alps: <GPE>Savoy</GPE> or Avignon, to which they acceded with reluctance, were described at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> as situate far beyond the pillars of Hercules; (43) the emperor and his clergy were apprehensive of the dangers of a long navigation; they were offended by a haughty declaration, that after suppressing the new heresy of the Bohemians, the council would soon eradicate the old heresy of the Greeks.
 (44) On the side of Eugenius, all was smooth, and yielding, and respectful; and he invited the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> monarch to heal by his presence the schism of the Latin, as well as of the Eastern, church.
 Ferrara, near the coast of the Adriatic, was proposed for their amicable interview; and with some indulgence of forgery and theft, a surreptitious decree was procured, which transferred the synod, with its own consent, to that <NORP>Italian</NORP> city.
 <CARDINAL>Nine</CARDINAL> galleys were equipped for the service at Venice, and in the Isle of Candia; their diligence anticipated the slower vessels of Basil: the <NORP>Roman</NORP> admiral was commissioned to burn, sink, and destroy; (45) and these priestly squadrons might have encountered each other in the same seas where <GPE>Athens</GPE> and <GPE>Sparta</GPE> had formerly contended for the preeminence of glory.
 Assaulted by the importunity of the factions, who were ready to fight for the possession of his person, <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> hesitated before he left his palace and country on a perilous experiment.
 His father's advice still dwelt on his memory; and reason must suggest, that since the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were divided among themselves, they could never unite in a foreign cause.
 <PERSON>Sigismond</PERSON> dissuaded the unreasonable adventure; his advice was impartial, since he adhered to the council; and it was enforced by the strange belief, that the <NORP>German</NORP> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> would nominate a <NORP>Greek</NORP> his heir and successor in the empire of the West.
 (46) Even the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan was a counsellor whom it might be unsafe to trust, but whom it was dangerous to offend.
 <PERSON>Amurath</PERSON> was unskilled in the disputes, but he was apprehensive of the union, of the Christians.
 From his own treasures, he offered to relieve the wants of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court; yet he declared with seeming magnanimity, that <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> should be secure and inviolate, in the absence of her sovereign.
 (47) The resolution of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> was decided by the most splendid gifts and the most specious promises: he wished to escape for a while from a scene of danger and distress and after dismissing with an ambiguous answer the messengers of the council, he declared his intention of embarking in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> galleys.
 The age of the patriarch <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> was more susceptible of fear than of hope; he trembled at the perils of the sea, and expressed his apprehension, that his feeble voice, with <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> perhaps of his orthodox brethren, would be oppressed in a foreign land by the power and numbers of a <NORP>Latin</NORP> synod.
 He yielded to the royal mandate, to the flattering assurance, that he would be heard as the oracle of nations, and to the secret wish of learning from his brother of the West, to deliver the church from the yoke of kings.
 (48) The <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> cross-bearers, or dignitaries, of St.
 Sophia, were bound to attend his person; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these, the great ecclesiarch or preacher, Sylvester Syropulus, (49) has composed a free and curious history (50) of the false union.
 (51) Of the clergy that reluctantly obeyed the summons of the emperor and the patriarch, submission was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> duty, and patience the most useful virtue.
 In a chosen list of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> bishops, we discover the metropolitan titles of Heracleae and Cyzicus, <GPE>Nice</GPE> and Nicomedia, <PERSON>Ephesus</PERSON> and Trebizond, and the personal merit of <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> and <NORP>Bessarion</NORP> who, in the confidence of their learning and eloquence, were promoted to the episcopal rank.
 Some monks and philosophers were named to display the science and sanctity of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church; and the service of the choir was performed by a select band of singers and musicians.
 The patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, appeared by their genuine or fictitious deputies; the primate of <GPE>Russia</GPE> represented a national church, and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> might contend with the <NORP>Latins</NORP> in the extent of their spiritual empire.
 The precious vases of St.
 Sophia were exposed to the winds and waves, that the patriarch might officiate with becoming splendour: whatever gold the emperor could procure, was expended in the massy ornaments of his bed and chariot; (52) and while they affected to maintain the prosperity of their ancient fortune, they quarrelled for the division of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand ducats, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> alms of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 After the necessary preparations, <PERSON>John</PERSON> Palaeologus, with a numerous train, accompanied by his brother Demetrius, and the most respectable persons of the church and state, embarked in <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> vessels with sails and oars which steered through the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> Straits of <GPE>Gallipoli</GPE> to the Archipelago, the Morea, and the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf.
 (53) His triumphal entry at Venice, A.
D.
 1438, February 9; After a tedious and troublesome navigation of seventy-seven days, this religious squadron cast anchor before Venice; and their reception proclaimed the joy and magnificence of that powerful republic.
 In the command of the world, the modest <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> had never claimed such honours from his subjects as were paid to his feeble successor by an independent state.
 Seated on the poop on a lofty throne, he received the visit, or, in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> style, the adoration of the doge and senators.
 (54) They sailed in the Bucentaur, which was accompanied by <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> stately galleys: the sea was overspread with innumerable gondolas of pomp and pleasure; the air resounded with music and acclamations; the mariners, and even the vessels, were dressed in silk and gold; and in all the emblems and pageants, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> eagles were blended with the lions of St.
 Mark.
 The triumphal procession, ascending the great canal, passed under the bridge of the Rialto; and the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> strangers gazed with admiration on the palaces, the churches, and the populousness of a city, that seems to float on the bosom of the waves.
 (55) They sighed to behold the spoils and trophies with which it had been decorated after the sack of Constantinople.
 After a hospitable entertainment of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> days, <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> pursued his journey by land and water from <GPE>Venice</GPE> to Ferrara; and on this occasion the pride of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> was tempered by policy to indulge the ancient dignity of the emperor of the East.
 into Ferrara, February 28.
 He made his entry on a black horse; but a milk-white steed, whose trappings were embroidered with golden eagles, was led before him; and the canopy was borne over his head by the princes of Este, the sons or kinsmen of Nicholas, marquis of the city, and a sovereign more powerful than himself.
 (56) <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> did not alight till he reached the bottom of the staircase: the pope advanced to the door of the apartment; refused his proffered genuflection; and, after a paternal embrace, conducted the emperor to a seat on his left hand.
 Nor would the patriarch descend from his galley, till a ceremony almost equal, had been stipulated between the bishops of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Constantinople.
 The latter was saluted by his brother with a kiss of union and charity; nor would any of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> ecclesiastics submit to kiss the feet of the <NORP>Western</NORP> primate.
 On the opening of the synod, the place of honour in the centre was claimed by the temporal and ecclesiastical chiefs; and it was only by alleging that his predecessors had not assisted in person at <GPE>Nice</GPE> or Chalcedon, that <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> could evade the ancient precedents of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Marcian.
 After much debate, it was agreed that the right and left sides of the church should be occupied by the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations; that the solitary chair of St.
 Peter should be raised the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> line; and that the throne of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor, at the head of his clergy, should be equal and opposite to the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> place, the vacant seat of the emperor of the West.
 (57) Council of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> at <GPE>Ferrara</GPE> and Florence, A.
D.
 1438, October 8- 1439, July 6.
 But as soon as festivity and form had given place to a more serious treaty, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were dissatisfied with their journey, with themselves, and with the pope.
 The artful pencil of his emissaries had painted him in a prosperous state; at the head of the princes and prelates of Europe, obedient at his voice, to believe and to arm.
 The thin appearance of the universal synod of <GPE>Ferrara</GPE> betrayed his weakness: and the <NORP>Latins</NORP> opened the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> session with only <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> archbishops, <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> bishops, and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> abbots, the greatest part of whom were the subjects or countrymen of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> pontiff.
 Except the duke of Burgundy, none of the potentates of the <LOC>West</LOC> condescended to appear in person, or by their ambassadors; nor was it possible to suppress the judicial acts of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> against the dignity and person of Eugenius, which were finally concluded by a new election.
 Under these circumstances, a truce or delay was asked and granted, till <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> could expect from the consent of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> some temporal reward for an unpopular union; and after the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> session, the public proceedings were adjourned above <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months.
 The emperor, with a chosen band of his favourites and Janizaries, fixed his summer residence at a pleasant, spacious monastery, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> miles from Ferrara; forgot, in the pleasures of the chase, the distress of the church and state; and persisted in destroying the game, without listening to the just complaints of the marquis or the husbandman.
 (58) In the mean while, his unfortunate <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were exposed to all the miseries of exile and poverty; for the support of each stranger, a <DATE>monthly</DATE> allowance was assigned of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> gold florins; and although the entire sum did not amount to seven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> florins, a long arrear was repeatedly incurred by the indigence or policy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> court.
 (59) They sighed for a speedy deliverance, but their escape was prevented by a triple chain: a passport from their superiors was required at the gates of Ferrara; the government of <GPE>Venice</GPE> had engaged to arrest and send back the fugitives; and inevitable punishment awaited them at Constantinople; excommunication, fines, and a sentence, which did not respect the sacerdotal dignity, that they should be stripped naked and publicly whipped.
 (60) It was only by the alternative of hunger or dispute that the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> could be persuaded to open the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conference; and they yielded with extreme reluctance to attend from <GPE>Ferrara</GPE> to <GPE>Florence</GPE> the rear of a flying synod.
 This new translation was urged by inevitable necessity: the city was visited by the plague; the fidelity of the marquis might be suspected; the mercenary troops of the duke of <GPE>Milan</GPE> were at the gates; and as they occupied Romagna, it was not without difficulty and danger that the pope, the emperor, and the bishops, explored their way through the unfrequented paths of the Apennine.
 (61) Yet all these obstacles were surmounted by time and policy.
 The violence of the fathers of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> rather promoted than injured the cause of Eugenius; the nations of <LOC>Europe</LOC> abhorred the schism, and disowned the election, of <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> the Fifth, who was successively a duke of Savoy, a hermit, and a pope; and the great princes were gradually reclaimed by his competitor to a favourable neutrality and a firm attachment.
 The legates, with some respectable members, deserted to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army, which insensibly rose in numbers and reputation; the council of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> was reduced to <CARDINAL>thirty-nine</CARDINAL> bishops, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the inferior clergy; (62) while the <NORP>Latins</NORP> of <GPE>Florence</GPE> could produce the subscriptions of the pope himself, <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> cardinals, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> patriarchs, <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> archbishops, fifty <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bishops, and forty- <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> abbots, or chiefs of religious orders.
 After the labor of nine months, and the debates of <CARDINAL>twenty-five</CARDINAL> sessions, they attained the advantage and glory of the reunion of the Greeks.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> principal questions had been agitated between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches; 1.
 The use of unleaven bread in the communion of Christ's body2.
The nature of purgatory.
 3.
The supremacy of the pope.
 And, 4.
The single or double procession of the Holy Ghost.
The cause of either nation was managed by <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> theological champions: the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were supported by the inexhaustible eloquence of Cardinal Julian; and <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> of <PERSON>Ephesus</PERSON> and <NORP>Bessarion</NORP> of <GPE>Nice</GPE> were the bold and able leaders of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> forces.
 We may bestow some praise on the progress of human reason, by observing that the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these questions was now treated as an immaterial rite, which might innocently vary with the fashion of the age and country.
 With regard to the second, both parties were agreed in the belief of an intermediate state of purgation for the venial sins of the faithful; and whether their souls were purified by elemental fire was a doubtful point, which in a few years might be conveniently settled on the spot by the disputants.
 The claims of supremacy appeared of a more weighty and substantial kind; yet by the <NORP>Orientals</NORP> the <NORP>Roman</NORP> bishop had ever been respected as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> patriarchs; nor did they scruple to admit, that his jurisdiction should be exercised agreeably to the holy canons; a vague allowance, which might be defined or eluded by occasional convenience.
 The procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father alone, or from the Father and the Son, was an article of faith which had sunk much deeper into the minds of men; and in the sessions of <GPE>Ferrara</GPE> and Florence, the <NORP>Latin</NORP> addition of filioque was subdivided into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> questions, whether it were legal, and whether it were orthodox.
 Perhaps it may not be necessary to boast on this subject of my own impartial indifference; but I must think that the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were strongly supported by the prohibition of the council of Chalcedon, against adding any article whatsoever to the creed of Nice, or rather of Constantinople.
 (63) In earthly affairs, it is not easy to conceive how an assembly equal of legislators can bind their successors invested with powers equal to their own.
 But the dictates of inspiration must be true and unchangeable; nor should a private bishop, or a provincial synod, have presumed to innovate against the judgment of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 On the substance of the doctrine, the controversy was equal and endless: reason is confounded by the procession of a deity: the gospel, which lay on the altar, was silent; the various texts of the fathers might be corrupted by fraud or entangled by sophistry; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were ignorant of the characters and writings of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> saints.
 (64) Of this at least we may be sure, that neither side could be convinced by the arguments of their opponents.
 Prejudice may be enlightened by reason, and a superficial glance may be rectified by a clear and more perfect view of an object adapted to our faculties.
 But the bishops and monks had been taught from their infancy to repeat a form of mysterious words: their national and personal honour depended on the repetition of the same sounds; and their narrow minds were hardened and inflamed by the acrimony of a public dispute.
 Negotiations with the Greeks.
 While they were most in a cloud of dust and darkness, the <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> and emperor were desirous of a seeming union, which could alone accomplish the purposes of their interview; and the obstinacy of public dispute was softened by the arts of private and personal negotiation.
 The patriarch <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> had sunk under the weight of age and infirmities; his dying voice breathed the counsels of charity and concord, and his vacant benefice might tempt the hopes of the ambitious clergy.
 The ready and active obedience of the archbishops of <GPE>Russia</GPE> and Nice, of <PERSON>Isidore</PERSON> and Bessarion, was prompted and recompensed by their speedy promotion to the dignity of cardinals.
 Bessarion, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> debates, had stood forth the most strenuous and eloquent champion of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church; and if the apostate, the bastard, was reprobated by his country, (65) he appears in ecclesiastical story a rare example of a patriot who was recommended to court favour by loud opposition and well-timed compliance.
 With the aid of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> spiritual coadjutors, the emperor applied his arguments to the general situation and personal characters of the bishops, and each was successively moved by authority and example.
 Their revenues were in the hands of the Turks, their persons in those of the Latins: an episcopal treasure, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> robes and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> ducats, was soon exhausted: (66) the hopes of their return still depended on the ships of <GPE>Venice</GPE> and the alms of Rome; and such was their indigence, that their arrears, the payment of a debt, would be accepted as a favour, and might operate as a bribe.
 (67) The danger and relief of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> might excuse some prudent and pious dissimulation; and it was insinuated, that the obstinate heretics who should resist the consent of the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> would be abandoned in a hostile land to the revenge or justice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 (68) In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> private assembly of the Greeks, the formulary of union was approved by twenty-four, and rejected by twelve, members; but the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> cross-bearers of St.
 Sophia, who aspired to represent the patriarch, were disqualified by ancient discipline; and their right of voting was transferred to the obsequious train of monks, grammarians, and profane laymen.
 The will of the monarch produced a false and servile unanimity, and no more than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> patriots had courage to speak their own sentiments and those of their country.
 Demetrius, the emperor's brother, retired to Venice, that he might not be witness of the union; and <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> of Ephesus, mistaking perhaps his pride for his conscience, disclaimed all communion with the <NORP>Latin</NORP> heretics, and avowed himself the champion and confessor of the orthodox creed.
 (69) In the treaty between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, several forms of consent were proposed, such as might satisfy the Latins, without dishonouring the Greeks; and they weighed the scruples of words and syllables, till the theological balance trembled with a slight preponderance in favour of the Vatican.
 It was agreed (I must entreat the attention of the reader) that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son, as from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> principle and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> substance; that he proceeds by the Son, being of the same nature and substance, and that he proceeds from the Father and the Son, by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> spiration and production.
 It is less difficult to understand the articles of the preliminary treaty; that the pope should defray all the expenses of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> in their return home; that he should annually maintain <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> galleys and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers for the defence of Constantinople: that all the ships which transported pilgrims to <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> should be obliged to touch at that port; that as often as they were required, the pope should furnish <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> galleys for a year, or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> for <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months; and that he should powerfully solicit the princes of Europe, if the emperor had occasion for land forces.
 <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> deposed at Basil, A.
D.
 1438, June 25.
 The same year, and almost the same day, were marked by the deposition of <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> at Basil; and, at Florence, by his reunion of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins.
 In the former synod, (which he styled indeed an assembly of daemons,) the pope was branded with the guilt of simony, perjury, tyranny, heresy, and schism; (70) and declared to be incorrigible in his vices, unworthy of any title, and incapable of holding any ecclesiastical office.
 Re-union of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> at Florence, A.
D.
 1438, July 6.
 In the latter, he was revered as the true and holy vicar of Christ, who, after a separation of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, had reconciled the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> of the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> fold, and under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> shepherd.
 The act of union was subscribed by the pope, the emperor, and the principal members of both churches; even by those who, like Syropulus, (71) had been deprived of the right of voting.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> copies might have sufficed for the <LOC>East</LOC> and West; but <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> was not satisfied, unless <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> authentic and similar transcripts were signed and attested as the monuments of his victory.
 (72) On a memorable day, the sixth of July, the successors of St.
 Peter and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> ascended their thrones the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations assembled in the cathedral of Florence; their representatives, Cardinal <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> and <NORP>Bessarion</NORP> archbishop of Nice, appeared in the pulpit, and, after reading in their respective tongues the act of union, they mutually embraced, in the name and the presence of their applauding brethren.
 The pope and his ministers then officiated according to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> liturgy; the creed was chanted with the addition of filioque; the acquiescence of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was poorly excused by their ignorance of the harmonious, but inarticulate sounds; (73) and the more scrupulous <NORP>Latins</NORP> refused any public celebration of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> rite.
 Yet the emperor and his clergy were not totally unmindful of national honour.
 The treaty was ratified by their consent: it was tacitly agreed that no innovation should be attempted in their creed or ceremonies: they spared, and secretly respected, the generous firmness of <PERSON>Mark</PERSON> of Ephesus; and, on the decease of the patriarch, they refused to elect his successor, except in the cathedral of St.
 Sophia.
 In the distribution of public and private rewards, the liberal pontiff exceeded their hopes and his promises: Their return to Constantinople, A.
D.
 1440 February 1.
 the Greeks, with less pomp and pride, returned by the same road of <GPE>Ferrara</GPE> and Venice; and their reception at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was such as will be described in the following chapter.
 (74) The success of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> trial encouraged <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> to repeat the same edifying scenes; and the deputies of the Armenians, the Maronites, the <NORP>Jacobites</NORP> of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Egypt, the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> and the Aethiopians, were successively introduced, to kiss the feet of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, and to announce the obedience and the orthodoxy of the East.
 These <NORP>Oriental</NORP> embassies, unknown in the countries which they presumed to represent, (75) diffused over the <LOC>West</LOC> the fame of Eugenius; and a clamour was artfully propagated against the remnant of a schism in <GPE>Switzerland</GPE> and Savoy, which alone impeded the harmony of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world.
 The vigour of opposition was succeeded by the lassitude of despair: the council of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> was silently dissolved; and Felix, renouncing the tiara, again withdrew to the devout or delicious hermitage of Ripaille.
 (76) Final peace of the church, A.
D.
 1449.
 A general peace was secured by mutual acts of oblivion and indemnity: all ideas of reformation subsided; the popes continued to exercise and abuse their ecclesiastical despotism; nor has <GPE>Rome</GPE> been since disturbed by the mischiefs of a contested election.
 (77) State of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language at Constantinople, A.
D.
 1300-1453.
 The journeys of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> emperors were unavailing for their temporal, or perhaps their spiritual, salvation; but they were productive of a beneficial consequence â€” the revival of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> learning in Italy, from whence it was propagated to the last nations of the <LOC>West</LOC> and North.
 In their lowest servitude and depression, the subjects of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne were still possessed of a golden key that could unlock the treasures of antiquity; of a musical and prolific language, that gives a soul to the objects of sense, and a body to the abstractions of philosophy.
 Since the barriers of the monarchy, and even of the capital, had been trampled under foot, the various <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> had doubtless corrupted the form and substance of the national dialect; and ample glossaries have been composed, to interpret a multitude of words, of Arabic, Turkish, Sclavonian, Latin, or <NORP>French</NORP> origin.
 (78) But a purer idiom was spoken in the court and taught in the college; and the flourishing state of the language is described, and perhaps embellished, by a learned Italian, (79) who, by a long residence and noble marriage, (80) was naturalized at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> about <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years before the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> conquest.
 Among the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> a numerous and opulent clergy was dedicated to the service of religion: their monks and bishops have ever been distinguished by the gravity and austerity of their manners; nor were they diverted, like the <NORP>Latin</NORP> priests, by the pursuits and pleasures of a secular, and even military, life.
 After a large deduction for the time and talent that were lost in the devotion, the laziness, and the discord, of the church and cloister, the more inquisitive and ambitious minds would explore the sacred and profane erudition of their native language.
 The ecclesiastics presided over the education of youth; the schools of philosophy and eloquence were perpetuated till the fall of the empire; and it may be affirmed, that more books and more knowledge were included within the walls of Constantinople, than could be dispersed over the extensive countries of the West.
 (83) Comparison of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins.
 But an important distinction has been already noticed: the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were stationary or retrograde, while the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were advancing with a rapid and progressive motion.
 The nations were excited by the spirit of independence and emulation; and even the little world of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> states contained more people and industry than the decreasing circle of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 In Europe, the lower ranks of society were relieved from the yoke of feudal servitude; and freedom is the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> step to curiosity and knowledge.
 The use, however rude and corrupt, of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> tongue had been preserved by superstition; the universities, from <GPE>Bologna</GPE> to Oxford, (84) were peopled with <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of scholars; and their misguided ardour might be directed to more liberal and manly studies.
 In the resurrection of science, <GPE>Italy</GPE> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> that cast away her shroud; and the eloquent Petrarch, by his lessons and his example, may justly be applauded as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> harbinger of day.
 A purer style of composition, a more generous and rational strain of sentiment, flowed from the study and imitation of the writers of ancient Rome; and the disciples of <PERSON>Cicero</PERSON> and <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> approached, with reverence and love, the sanctuary of their <NORP>Grecian</NORP> masters.
 In the sack of Constantinople, the French, and even the Venetians, had despised and destroyed the works of <NORP>Lysippus</NORP> and Homer: the monuments of art may be annihilated by a single blow; but the immortal mind is renewed and multiplied by the copies of the pen; and such copies it was the ambition of <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> and his friends to possess and understand.
 The arms of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> undoubtedly pressed the flight of the Muses; yet we may tremble at the thought, that <GPE>Greece</GPE> might have been overwhelmed, with her schools and libraries, before <LOC>Europe</LOC> had emerged from the deluge of barbarism; that the seeds of science might have been scattered by the winds, before the <NORP>Italian</NORP> soil was prepared for their cultivation.
 Revival of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> learning in Italy.
 The most learned <NORP>Italians</NORP> of the fifteenth century have confessed and applauded the restoration of <NORP>Greek</NORP> literature, after a long oblivion of many <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years.
 (85) Yet in that country, and beyond the Alps, some names are quoted; some profound scholars, who in the darker ages were honourably distinguished by their knowledge of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> tongue; and national vanity has been loud in the praise of such rare examples of erudition.
 Without scrutinizing the merit of individuals, truth must observe, that their science is without a cause, and without an effect; that it was easy for them to satisfy themselves and their more ignorant contemporaries; and that the idiom, which they had so marvellously acquired was transcribed in few manuscripts, and was not taught in any university of the West.
 In a corner of Italy, it faintly existed as the popular, or at least as the ecclesiastical dialect.
 (86) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> impression of the <LOC>Doric</LOC> and Ionic colonies has never been completely erased: the <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> churches were long attached to the throne of Constantinople: and the monks of St.
 <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> pursued their studies in Mount Athos and the schools of the East.
 <GPE>Calabria</GPE> was the native country of Barlaam, who has already appeared as a sectary and an ambassador; Lessons of Barlaam, A.
D.
 1339.
 and <PERSON>Barlaam</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who revived, beyond the Alps, the memory, or at least the writings, of Homer.
 (87) He is described, by <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> and Boccace, (88) as a man of diminutive stature, though truly great in the measure of learning and genius; of a piercing discernment, though of a slow and painful elocution.
 For many ages (as they affirm) <GPE>Greece</GPE> had not produced his equal in the knowledge of history, grammar, and philosophy; and his merit was celebrated in the attestations of the princes and doctors of Constantinople.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of these attestations is still extant; and the emperor Cantacuzene, the protector of his adversaries, is forced to allow, that Euclid, Aristotle, and Plato, were familiar to that profound and subtle logician.
 (89) In the court of Avignon, he formed an intimate connection with Petrarch, (90) the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> scholars; and the desire of mutual instruction was the principle of their literary commerce.
 Studies of Petrarch, A.
D.
 1339-1374.
 The <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> applied himself with eager curiosity and assiduous diligence to the study of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language; and in a laborious struggle with the dryness and difficulty of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rudiments, he began to reach the sense, and to feel the spirit, of poets and philosophers, whose minds were congenial to his own.
 But he was soon deprived of the society and lessons of this useful assistant: <PERSON>Barlaam</PERSON> relinquished his fruitless embassy; and, on his return to Greece, he rashly provoked the swarms of fanatic monks, by attempting to substitute the light of reason to that of their navel.
 After a separation of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> friends again met in the court of Naples: but the generous pupil renounced the fairest occasion of improvement; and by his recommendation <PERSON>Barlaam</PERSON> was finally settled in a small bishopric of his native Calabria.
 (91) The manifold avocations of Petrarch, love and friendship, his various correspondence and frequent journeys, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> laurel, and his elaborate compositions in prose and verse, in <NORP>Latin</NORP> and Italian, diverted him from a foreign idiom; and as he advanced in life, the attainment of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language was the object of his wishes rather than of his hopes.
 When he was about fifty years of age, a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> ambassador, his friend, and a master of both tongues, presented him with a copy of Homer; and the answer of <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> is at <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> expressive of his eloquence, gratitude, and regret.
 After celebrating the generosity of the donor, and the value of a gift more precious in his estimation than gold or rubies, he thus proceeds:Of Boccace, A.
D.
 1360 etc.
 The prize which eluded the efforts of Petrarch, was obtained by the fortune and industry of his friend Boccace, (93) the father of the <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> prose.
 That popular writer, who derives his reputation from the Decameron, a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> novels of pleasantry and love, may aspire to the more serious praise of restoring in <GPE>Italy</GPE> the study of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language.
 In the year <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty, a disciple of Barlaam, whose name was Leo, or Leontius Pilatus, was detained in his way to <GPE>Avignon</GPE> by the advice and hospitality of Boccace, who lodged the stranger in his house, prevailed on the republic of <GPE>Florence</GPE> to allow him an annual stipend, and devoted his leisure to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Greek</NORP> professor, who taught that language in the <NORP>Western</NORP> countries of Europe.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> Pilatus, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Greek</NORP> professor at Florence, and in the West, A.
D.
 1360-1363.
 The appearance of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> might disgust the most eager disciple, he was clothed in the mantle of a philosopher, or a mendicant; his countenance was hideous; his face was overshadowed with black hair; his beard long an uncombed; his deportment rustic; his temper gloomy and inconstant; nor could he grace his discourse with the ornaments, or even the perspicuity, of <NORP>Latin</NORP> elocution.
 But his mind was stored with a treasure of <NORP>Greek</NORP> learning: history and fable, philosophy and grammar, were alike at his command; and he read the poems of <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> in the schools of Florence.
 It was from his explanation that <PERSON>Boccace</PERSON> composed and transcribed a literal prose version of the <WORK_OF_ART>Iliad</WORK_OF_ART> and Odyssey, which satisfied the thirst of his friend Petrarch, and which, perhaps, in the succeeding century, was clandestinely used by Laurentius Valla, the <NORP>Latin</NORP> interpreter.
 It was from his narratives that the same <PERSON>Boccace</PERSON> collected the materials for his treatise on the genealogy of the heathen gods, a work, in that age, of stupendous erudition, and which he ostentatiously sprinkled with <NORP>Greek</NORP> characters and passages, to excite the wonder and applause of his more ignorant readers.
 (94) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of learning are slow and laborious; no more than <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> votaries of <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> could be enumerated in all Italy; and neither Rome, nor Venice, nor Naples, could add a single name to this studious catalogue.
 But their numbers would have multiplied, their progress would have been accelerated, if the inconstant Leo, at the end of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, had not relinquished an honourable and beneficial station.
 In his passage, <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> entertained him at <GPE>Padua</GPE> a short time: he enjoyed the scholar, but was justly offended with the gloomy and unsocial temper of the man.
 Discontented with the world and with himself, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> depreciated his present enjoyments, while absent persons and objects were dear to his imagination.
 In <GPE>Italy</GPE> he was a Thessalian, in <GPE>Greece</GPE> a native of Calabria: in the company of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> he disdained their language, religion, and manners: no sooner was he landed at Constantinople, than he again sighed for the wealth of <GPE>Venice</GPE> and the elegance of Florence.
 His <NORP>Italian</NORP> friends were deaf to his importunity: he depended on their curiosity and indulgence, and embarked on a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> voyage; but on his entrance into the Adriatic, the ship was assailed by a tempest, and the unfortunate teacher, who like <PERSON>Ulysses</PERSON> had fastened himself to the mast, was struck dead by a flash of lightning.
 The humane <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> dropped a tear on his disaster; but he was most anxious to learn whether some copy of <PERSON>Euripides</PERSON> or <PERSON>Sophocles</PERSON> might not be saved from the hands of the mariners.
 (95) Foundation of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language in <GPE>Italy</GPE> by <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> Chrysoloras, A.
D.
 1390- 1415.
 But the faint rudiments of <NORP>Greek</NORP> learning, which <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> had encouraged and <PERSON>Boccace</PERSON> had planted, soon withered and expired.
 The succeeding generation was content for a while with the improvement of <NORP>Latin</NORP> eloquence; nor was it before the end of the fourteenth century that a new and perpetual flame was rekindled in Italy.
 (96) Previous to his own journey the emperor <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> despatched his envoys and orators to implore the compassion of the <NORP>Western</NORP> princes.
 Of these envoys, the most conspicuous, or the most learned, was <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> Chrysoloras, (97) of noble birth, and whose <NORP>Roman</NORP> ancestors are supposed to have migrated with the great Constantine.
 After visiting the courts of <GPE>France</GPE> and England, where he obtained some contributions and more promises, the envoy was invited to assume the office of a professor; and <GPE>Florence</GPE> had again the honour of this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> invitation.
 By his knowledge, not only of the Greek, but of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> tongue, <PERSON>Chrysoloras</PERSON> deserved the stipend, and surpassed the expectation, of the republic.
 His school was frequented by a crowd of disciples of every rank and age; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these, in a general history, has described his motives and his success.
 At the same time and place, the <NORP>Latin</NORP> classics were explained by <PERSON>John</PERSON> of Ravenna, the domestic pupil of Petrarch; (100) the Italians, who illustrated their age and country, were formed in this double school; and <GPE>Florence</GPE> became the fruitful seminary of <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Roman</NORP> erudition.
 (101) The presence of the emperor recalled <PERSON>Chrysoloras</PERSON> from the college to the court; but he afterwards taught at <GPE>Pavia</GPE> and <GPE>Rome</GPE> with equal industry and applause.
 The remainder of his life, about <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years, was divided between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Constantinople, between embassies and lessons.
 In the noble office of enlightening a foreign nation, the grammarian was not unmindful of a more sacred duty to his prince and country; and Emanuel <PERSON>Chrysoloras</PERSON> died at <PERSON>Constance</PERSON> on a public mission from the emperor to the council.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> in Italy, A.
D.
 1400-1500.
 After his example, the restoration of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> letters in <GPE>Italy</GPE> was prosecuted by a series of emigrants, who were destitute of fortune, and endowed with learning, or at least with language.
 From the terror or oppression of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> arms, the natives of <GPE>Thessalonica</GPE> and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> escaped to a land of freedom, curiosity, and wealth.
 The synod introduced into <GPE>Florence</GPE> the lights of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church, and the oracles of the <NORP>Platonic</NORP> philosophy; and the fugitives who adhered to the union, had the double merit of renouncing their country, not only for the Christian, but for the catholic cause.
 A patriot, who sacrifices his party and conscience to the allurements of favour, may be possessed, however, of the private and social virtues: he no longer hears the reproachful epithets of slave and apostate; and the consideration which he acquires among his new associates will restore in his own eyes the dignity of his character.
 Cardinal Bessarion, etc.
 The prudent conformity of <NORP>Bessarion</NORP> was rewarded with the <NORP>Roman</NORP> purple: he fixed his residence in Italy; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> cardinal, the titular patriarch of Constantinople, was respected as the chief and protector of his nation: (102) his abilities were exercised in the legations of Bologna, Venice, Germany, and France; and his election to the chair of St.
 Peter floated for a moment on the uncertain breath of a conclave.
 (103) His ecclesiastical honours diffused a splendour and preeminence over his literary merit and service: his palace was a school; as often as the cardinal visited the Vatican, he was attended by a learned train of both nations; (104) of men applauded by themselves and the public; and whose writings, now overspread with dust, were popular and useful in their own times.
 I shall not attempt to enumerate the restorers of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> literature in the fifteenth century; and it may be sufficient to mention with gratitude the names of <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> Gaza, of George of Trebizond, of <PERSON>John</PERSON> Argyropulus, and <PERSON>Demetrius</PERSON> Chalcocondyles, who taught their native language in the schools of <GPE>Florence</GPE> and Rome.
 Their faults and merits.
 Their labours were not inferior to those of Bessarion, whose purple they revered, and whose fortune was the secret object of their envy.
 But the lives of these grammarians were humble and obscure: they had declined the lucrative paths of the church; their dress and manners secluded them from the commerce of the world; and since they were confined to the merit, they might be content with the rewards, of learning.
 From this character, Janus Lascaris (105) will deserve an exception.
 His eloquence, politeness, and <NORP>Imperial</NORP> descent, recommended him to the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch; and in the same cities he was alternately employed to teach and to negotiate.
 Duty and interest prompted them to cultivate the study of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> language; and the most successful attained the faculty of writing and speaking with fluency and elegance in a foreign idiom.
 But they ever retained the inveterate vanity of their country: their praise, or at least their esteem, was reserved for the national writers, to whom they owed their fame and subsistence; and they sometimes betrayed their contempt in licentious criticism or satire on Virgil's poetry, and the oratory of Tully.
 (106) The superiority of these masters arose from the familiar use of a living language; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> disciples were incapable of discerning how far they had degenerated from the knowledge, and even the practice of their ancestors.
 A vicious pronunciation, (107) which they introduced, was banished from the schools by the reason of the succeeding age.
 Of the power of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> accents they were ignorant; and those musical notes, which, from an Attic tongue, and to an Attic ear, must have been the secret soul of harmony, were to their eyes, as to our own, no more than minute and unmeaning marks, in prose superfluous and troublesome in verse.
 The art of grammar they truly possessed; the valuable fragments of <NORP>Apollonius</NORP> and <NORP>Herodian</NORP> were transfused into their lessons; and their treatises of syntax and etymology, though devoid of philosophic spirit, are still useful to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> student.
 In the shipwreck of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> libraries, each fugitive seized a fragment of treasure, a copy of some author, who without his industry might have perished: the transcripts were multiplied by an assiduous, and sometimes an elegant pen; and the text was corrected and explained by their own comments, or those of the elder scholiasts.
 The sense, though not the spirit, of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> classics, was interpreted to the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world: the beauties of style evaporate in a version; but the judgment of <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> <LOC>Gaza</LOC> selected the more solid works of <PERSON>Aristotle</PERSON> and Theophrastus, and their natural histories of animals and plants opened a rich fund of genuine and experimental science.
 The <NORP>Platonic</NORP> philosophy.
 Yet the fleeting shadows of metaphysics were pursued with more curiosity and ardour.
 After a long oblivion, <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> was revived in <GPE>Italy</GPE> by a venerable Greek, (108) who taught in the house of <ORG>Cosmo</ORG> of Medicis.
 While the synod of <GPE>Florence</GPE> was involved in theological debate, some beneficial consequences might flow from the study of his elegant philosophy: his style is the purest standard of the Attic dialect, and his sublime thoughts are sometimes adapted to familiar conversation, and sometimes adorned with the richest colours of poetry and eloquence.
 The dialogues of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> are a dramatic picture of the life and death of a sage; and, as often as he descends from the clouds, his moral system inculcates the love of truth, of our country, and of mankind.
 The precept and example of <PERSON>Socrates</PERSON> recommended a modest doubt and liberal inquiry; and if the Platonists, with blind devotion, adored the visions and errors of their divine master, their enthusiasm might correct the dry, dogmatic method of the <NORP>Peripatetic</NORP> school.
 So equal, yet so opposite, are the merits of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> and Aristotle, that they may be balanced in endless controversy; but some spark of freedom may be produced by the collision of adverse servitude.
 The modern <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were divided between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sects: with more fury than skill they fought under the banner of their leaders; and the field of battle was removed in their flight from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to Rome.
 But this philosophical debate soon degenerated into an angry and personal quarrel of grammarians; and Bessarion, though an advocate for Plato, protected the national honour, by interposing the advice and authority of a mediator.
 In the gardens of the Medici, the academical doctrine was enjoyed by the polite and learned: but their philosophic society was quickly dissolved; and if the writings of the Attic sage were perused in the closet, the more powerful <PERSON>Stagyrite</PERSON> continued to reign, the oracle of the church and school.
 (109) Emulation and progress of the Latins.
 I have fairly represented the literary merits of the Greeks; yet it must be confessed, that they were seconded and surpassed by the ardour of the Latins.
 <GPE>Italy</GPE> was divided into many independent states; and at that time it was the ambition of princes and republics to vie with each other in the encouragement and reward of literature.
 <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> V.
 A.
D.
 1447-1455.
 The fame of <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> (110) has not been adequate to his merits.
 From a plebeian origin he raised himself by his virtue and learning: the character of the man prevailed over the interest of the pope; and he sharpened those weapons which were soon pointed against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church.
 (111) He had been the friend of the most eminent scholars of the age: he became their patron; and such was the humility of his manners, that the change was scarcely discernible either to them or to himself.
 If he pressed the acceptance of a liberal gift, it was not as the measure of desert, but as the proof of benevolence; and when modest merit declined his bounty, The influence of the holy see pervaded Christendom; and he exerted that influence in the search, not of benefices, but of books.
 From the ruins of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> libraries, from the darkest monasteries of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Britain, he collected the dusty manuscripts of the writers of antiquity; and wherever the original could not be removed, a faithful copy was transcribed and transmitted for his use.
 The Vatican, the old repository for bulls and legends, for superstition and forgery, was <DATE>daily</DATE> replenished with more precious furniture; and such was the industry of Nicholas, that in a reign of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> years he formed a library of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> thousand volumes.
 To his munificence the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world was indebted for the versions of Xenophon, Diodorus, Polybius, Thucydides, Herodotus, and Appian; of Strabo's Geography, of the Iliad, of the most valuable works of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> and Aristotle, of <PERSON>Ptolemy</PERSON> and Theophrastus, and of the fathers of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church.
 The example of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff was preceded or imitated by a <NORP>Florentine</NORP> merchant, who governed the republic without arms and without a title.
 <ORG>Cosmo</ORG> and <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> of Medicis, A.
D.
 1428-1492.
 <ORG>Cosmo</ORG> of Medicis (112) was the father of a line of princes, whose name and age are almost synonymous with the restoration of learning: his credit was ennobled into fame; his riches were dedicated to the service of mankind; he corresponded at once with <GPE>Cairo</GPE> and London: and a cargo of <NORP>Indian</NORP> spices and <NORP>Greek</NORP> books was often imported in the same vessel.
 The genius and education of his grandson <PERSON>Lorenzo</PERSON> rendered him not only a patron, but a judge and candidate, in the literary race.
 In his palace, distress was entitled to relief, and merit to reward: his leisure hours were delightfully spent in the <NORP>Platonic</NORP> academy; he encouraged the emulation of <PERSON>Demetrius</PERSON> Chalcocondyles and Angelo Politian; and his active missionary Janus Lascaris returned from the <LOC>East</LOC> with a treasure of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> manuscripts, fourscore of which were as yet unknown in the libraries of Europe.
 (113) The rest of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was animated by a similar spirit, and the progress of the nation repaid the liberality of their princes.
 The <NORP>Latins</NORP> held the exclusive property of their own literature; and these disciples of <GPE>Greece</GPE> were soon capable of transmitting and improving the lessons which they had imbibed.
 After a short succession of foreign teachers, the tide of emigration subsided; but the language of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was spread beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and the natives of France, Germany, and England, (114) imparted to their country the sacred fire which they had kindled in the schools of <GPE>Florence</GPE> and Rome.
 (115) In the productions of the mind, as in those of the soil, the gifts of nature are excelled by industry and skill: the <NORP>Greek</NORP> authors, forgotten on the banks of the Ilissus, have been illustrated on those of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and the Thames: and <NORP>Bessarion</NORP> or <LOC>Gaza</LOC> might have envied the superior science of the Barbarians; the accuracy of Budaeus, the taste of Erasmus, the copiousness of Stephens, the erudition of Scaliger, the discernment of Reiske, or of Bentley.
 On the side of the Latins, the discovery of printing was a casual advantage: but this useful art has been applied by Aldus, and his innumerable successors, to perpetuate and multiply the works of antiquity.
 (116) A single manuscript imported from <GPE>Greece</GPE> is revived in <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand copies; and each copy is fairer than the original.
 In this form, <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> would peruse with more satisfaction their own writings; and their scholiasts must resign the prize to the labours of our <NORP>Western</NORP> editors.
 Use and abuse of ancient learning.
 Before the revival of classic literature, the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in <LOC>Europe</LOC> were immersed in ignorance; and their vulgar tongues were marked with the rudeness and poverty of their manners.
 The students of the more perfect idioms of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Greece</GPE> were introduced to a new world of light and science; to the society of the free and polished nations of antiquity; and to a familiar converse with those immortal men who spoke the sublime language of eloquence and reason.
 Such an intercourse must tend to refine the taste, and to elevate the genius, of the moderns; and yet, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> experiments, it might appear that the study of the ancients had given fetters, rather than wings, to the human mind.
 However laudable, the spirit of imitation is of a servile cast; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> disciples of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Romans</NORP> were a colony of strangers in the midst of their age and country.
 The minute and laborious diligence which explored the antiquities of remote times might have improved or adorned the present state of society, the critic and metaphysician were the slaves of Aristotle; the poets, historians, and orators, were proud to repeat the thoughts and words of the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age: the works of nature were observed with the eyes of <NORP>Pliny</NORP> and Theophrastus; and some <NORP>Pagan</NORP> votaries professed a secret devotion to the gods of <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> and Plato.
 (117) The <NORP>Italians</NORP> were oppressed by the strength and number of their ancient auxiliaries: the century after the deaths of <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> and <PERSON>Boccace</PERSON> was filled with a crowd of <NORP>Latin</NORP> imitators, who decently repose on our shelves; but in that aera of learning it will not be easy to discern a real discovery of science, a work of invention or eloquence, in the popular language of the country.
 (118) But as soon as it had been deeply saturated with the celestial dew, the soil was quickened into vegetation and life; the modern idioms were refined; the classics of <GPE>Athens</GPE> and <GPE>Rome</GPE> inspired a pure taste and a generous emulation; and in Italy, as afterwards in <GPE>France</GPE> and England, the pleasing reign of poetry and fiction was succeeded by the light of speculative and experimental philosophy.
 Genius may anticipate the season of maturity; but in the education of a people, as in that of an individual, memory must be exercised, before the powers of reason and fancy can be expanded: nor may the artist hope to equal or surpass, till he has learned to imitate, the works of his predecessors.
