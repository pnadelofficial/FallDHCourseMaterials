The Empire of the East, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>395-1453</CARDINAL> Reign of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> , A.
D.
 395-408 THE division of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world between the sons of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> marks the final establishment of the empire of the East, which, from the reign of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> to the taking of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by the Turks, subsisted <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand and fifty-eight years in a state of premature and perpetual decay.
 The sovereign of that empire assumed and obstinately retained the vain, and at length fictitious, title of Emperor of the ROMANS; and the hereditary appellations of <ORG>CAESAR</ORG> and <ORG>AUGUSTUS</ORG> continued to declare that he was the legitimate successor of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of men, who had reigned over the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of nations.
 The palace of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> rivalled, and perhaps excelled, the magnificence of Persia; and the eloquent sermons of St <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> (1) celebrate, while they condemn, the pompous luxury of the reign of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> The successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> established their perpetual residence in the royal city which he had erected on the verge of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia.
 Inaccessible to the menaces of their enemies, and perhaps to the complaints of their people, they received with each wind the tributary productions of every climate; while the impregnable strength of their capital continued for ages to defy the hostile attempts of the barbarians.
 Their dominions were bounded by the <NORP>Hadriatic</NORP> and the Tigris; and the whole interval of twenty-five days' navigation, which separated the extreme cold of <PERSON>Scythia</PERSON> from the torrid zone of Aethiopia, (2) was comprehended within the limits of the empire of the East.
 The populous countries of that empire were the seat of art and learning, of luxury and wealth; and the inhabitants, who had assumed the language and manners of Greeks, styled themselves, with some appearance of truth, the most enlightened and civilised portion of the human species.
 The form of government was a pure and simple monarchy; the name of the ROMAN REPUBLIC, which so long preserved a faint tradition of freedom, was confined to the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> provinces; and the princes of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> measured their greatness by the servile obedience of their people.
 They were ignorant how much this passive disposition enervates and degrades every faculty of the mind.
 The subjects who had resigned their will to the absolute commands of a master were equally incapable of guarding their lives and fortunes against the assaults of the barbarians or of defending their reason from the terrors of superstition.
 Administration and character of Eutropius, A.
D.
 395-399 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> events of the reign of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> are so intimately connected, that the rebellion of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the fall of <GPE>Rufinus</GPE> have already claimed a place in the history of the West.
 It has already been observed that Eutropius, (3) <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the principal eunuchs of the palace of Constantinople, succeeded the haughty minister whose ruin he had accomplished and whose vices he soon imitated.
 Every order of the state bowed to the new favourite; and their tame and obsequious submission encouraged him to insult the laws, and, what is still more difficult and dangerous, the manners of his country.
 Under the weakest of the predecessors of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> the reign of the eunuchs had been secret and almost invisible.
 They insinuated themselves into the confidence of the prince but their ostensible functions were confined to the menial service of the wardrobe and <NORP>Imperial</NORP> bedchamber.
 They might direct in a whisper the public counsels, and blast by their malicious suggestions the fame and fortunes of the most illustrious citizens; but they never presumed to stand forward in the front of empire, (4) or to profane the public honours of the state.
 <PERSON>Eutropius</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of his artificial sex who dared to assume the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate and general.
 (5) Sometimes, in the presence of the blushing senate, he ascended the tribunal to pronounce judgment or to repeat elaborate harangues; and sometimes appeared on horseback, at the head of his troops, in the dress and armour of a hero.
 The disregard of custom and decency always betrays a weak and ill-regulated mind; nor does <PERSON>Eutropius</PERSON> seem to have compensated for the folly of the design by any superior merit or ability in the execution.
 His former habits of life had not introduced him to the study of the laws or the exercises of the field; his awkward and unsuccessful attempts provoked the secret contempt of the spectators; the <NORP>Goths</NORP> expressed their wish that such a general might always command the armies of Rome; and the name of the minister was branded with ridicule, more pernicious, perhaps, than hatred to a public character.
 The subjects of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> were exasperated by the recollection that this deformed and decrepit eunuch, (6) who so perversely mimicked the actions of a man, was born in the most abject conditions of servitude; that before he entered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> palace he had been successively sold and purchased by an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> masters, who had exhausted his youthful strength in every mean and infamous office, and at length dismissed him in his old age to freedom and poverty.
 (7) While these disgraceful stories were circulated, and perhaps exaggerated, in private conversations, the vanity of the favourite was flattered with the most extraordinary honours.
 In the senate, in the capital, in the provinces, the statues of <PERSON>Eutropius</PERSON> were erected, in brass or marble, decorated with the symbols of his civil and military virtues, and inscribed with the pompous title of the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> founder of Constantinople.
 He was promoted to the rank of patrician, which began to signify, in a popular and even legal acceptation, the father of the emperor: and the last year of the fourth century was polluted by the consulship of an eunuch and a slave.
 This strange and inexpiable prodigy (8) awakened, however, the prejudices of the Romans.
 The effeminate consul was rejected by the <LOC>West</LOC> as an indelible stain to the annals of the republic; and without invoking the shades of <PERSON>Brutus</PERSON> and Camillus, the colleague of Eutropius, a learned and respectable magistrate, (9) sufficiently represented the different maxims of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> administrations.
 His venality and injustice The bold and vigorous mind of <GPE>Rufinus</GPE> seems to have been actuated by a more sanguinary and revengeful spirit; but the avarice of the eunuch was not less insatiate than that of the praefect.
 (10) As long as he despoiled the oppressors who had enriched themselves with the plunder of the people, <PERSON>Eutropius</PERSON> might gratify his covetous disposition without much envy or injustice: but the progress of his rapine soon invaded the wealth which had been acquired by lawful inheritance or laudable industry.
 The usual methods of extortion were practised and improved; and <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> has sketched a lively and original picture of the public auction of the state.
 This venal prostitution of public honours secured the impunity of future crimes; but the riches which <PERSON>Eutropius</PERSON> derived from confiscation were already stained with injustice; since it was decent to accuse and to condemn the proprietors of the wealth which he was impatient to confiscate.
 Some noble blood was shed by the hand of the executioner; and the most inhospitable extremities of the empire were filled with innocent and illustrious exiles.
 Among the generals and consuls of the East, <PERSON>Abundantius</PERSON> (12) had reason to dread the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> effects of the resentment of Eutropius.
 Ruin of Abundantius, He had been guilty of the unpardonable crime of introducing that abject slave to the palace of Constantinople; and some degree of praise must be allowed to a powerful and ungrateful favourite who was satisfied with the disgrace of his benefactor.
 <PERSON>Abundantius</PERSON> was stripped of his ample fortunes by an <NORP>Imperial</NORP> rescript, and banished to Pityus, on the Euxine, the last frontier of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; where he subsisted by the precarious mercy of the barbarians till he could obtain, after the fall of Eutropius, a milder exile at <GPE>Sidon</GPE> in Phoenicia.
 The destruction of <PERSON>Timasius</PERSON> (13) required a more serious and regular mode of attack.
 That great officer, the master-general of the armies of Theodosius, had signalised his valour by a decisive victory which he obtained over the <NORP>Goths</NORP> of Thessaly but he was too prone, after the example of his sovereign, to enjoy the luxury of peace and to abandon his confidence to wicked and designing flatterers.
 <PERSON>Timasius</PERSON> had despised the public clamour by promoting an infamous dependent to the command of a cohort; and he deserved to feel the ingratitude of Bargus, who was secretly instigated by the favourite to accuse his patron of a treasonable conspiracy.
 The general was arraigned before the tribunal of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> himself; and the principal eunuch stood by the side of the throne to suggest the questions and answers of his sovereign.
 But as this form of trial might be deemed partial and arbitrary, the further inquiry into the crimes of <PERSON>Timasius</PERSON> was delegated to <PERSON>Saturnius</PERSON> and Procopius; the former of consular rank, the latter still respected as the father-in-law of the emperor Valens.
 The appearances of a fair and legal proceeding were maintained by the blunt honesty of Procopius; and he yielded with reluctance to the obsequious dexterity of his colleague, who pronounced a sentence of condemnation against the unfortunate Timasius.
 His immense riches were confiscated in the name of the emperor and for the benefit of the favourite; and he was doomed to perpetual exile at Oasis, a solitary spot in the midst of the sandy deserts of Libya.
 (14) Secluded from all human converse, the master-general of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies was lost for ever to the world; but the circumstances of his fate have been related in a various and contradictory manner.
 It is insinuated that <PERSON>Eutropius</PERSON> despatched a private order for his secret execution.
 (15) It was reported that in attempting to escape from <LOC>Oasis</LOC> he perished in the desert of thirst and hunger, and that his dead body was found on the sands of Libya.
 (16) It has been asserted with more confidence that his son Syagrius, after successfully eluding the pursuit of the agents and emissaries of the court, collected a band of <NORP>African</NORP> robbers that he rescued <PERSON>Timasius</PERSON> from the place of his exile; and that both the father and the son disappeared from the knowledge of mankind.
 (17) But the ungrateful Bargus, instead of being suffered to possess the reward of guilt, was soon afterwards circumvented and destroyed by the more powerful villainy of the minister himself, who retained sense and spirit enough to abhor the instrument of his own crimes.
 A cruel and unjust law of treason, A.
D.
 397, September 4.
 The public hatred and the despair of individuals continually threatened, or seemed to threaten, the personal safety of Eutropius, as well as of the numerous adherents who were attached to his fortune and had been promoted by his venal favour.
 For their mutual defence he contrived the safeguard of a law which violated every principle of humanity and justice.
 (18) I.
 It is enacted, in the name and by the authority of Arcadius, that all those who shall conspire,either with subjects or with strangers, against the lives of any of the persons whom the emperor considers as the members of his own body, shall be punished with death and confiscation.
 This species of fictitious and metaphorical treason is extended to protect not only the illustrious officers of the state and army who are admitted into the sacred consistory, but likewise the principal domestics of the palace, the senators of Constantinople, the military commanders, and the civil magistrates of the provinces: a vague and indefinite list, which, under the successors of Constantine, included an obscure and numerous train of subordinate ministers.
 II.
 This extreme severity might perhaps be justified, had it been only directed to secure the representatives of the sovereign from any actual violence in the execution of their office.
 But the whole body of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dependents claimed a privilege, or rather impunity, which screened them in the loosest moments of their lives from the hasty, perhaps the justifiable, resentment of their fellow-citizens: and, by a strange perversion of the laws, the same degree of guilt and punishment was applied to a private quarrel and to a deliberate conspiracy against the emperor and the empire.
 The edict of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> most positively and most absurdly declares that in such cases of treason, thoughts and actions ought to be punished with equal severity; that the knowledge of a mischievous intention, unless it be instantly revealed, becomes equally criminal with the intention itself; (19) and that those rash men who shall presume to solicit the pardon of traitors shall themselves be branded with public and perpetual infamy.
 III.
 "With regard to the sons of traitors" (continues the emperor), "although they ought to share the punishment, since they will probably imitate the guilt of their parents, yet, by the special effect of our <NORP>Imperial</NORP> lenity, we grant them their lives; but, at the same time, we declare them incapable of inheriting, either on the father's or on the mother's side, or of receiving any gift or legacy from the testament either of kinsmen or of strangers.
 Stigmatised with hereditary infamy, excluded from the hopes of honours or fortune, let them endure the pangs of poverty and contempt till they shall consider life as a calamity and death as a comfort and relief.
" In such words, so well adapted to insult the feelings of mankind, did the emperor, or rather his favourite eunuch, applaud the moderation of a law which transferred the same unjust and inhuman penalties to the children of all those who had seconded or who had not disclosed these fictitious conspiracies.
 Some of the noblest regulations of <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence have been suffered to expire; but this edict, a convenient and forcible engine of ministerial tyranny, was carefully inserted in the codes of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> and Justinian; and the same maxims have been revived in modern ages to protect the electors of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and the cardinals of the church of Rome.
 (20) Rebellion of Tribigild, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>399</CARDINAL> Yet these sanguinary laws, which spread terror among a disarmed and dispirited people, were of too weak a texture to restrain the bold enterprise of <PERSON>Tribigild</PERSON> (21) the Ostrogoth.
 The colony of that warlike nation, which had been planted by <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most fertile districts of Phrygia, (22) impatiently compared the slow returns of laborious husbandry with the successful rapine and liberal rewards of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> and their leader resented, as a personal affront, his own ungracious reception in the palace of Constantinople.
 A soft and wealthy province in the heart of the empire was astonished by the sound of war, and the faithful vassal who had been disregarded or oppressed was again respected as soon as he resumed the hostile character of a barbarian.
 The vineyards and fruitful fields between the rapid <PRODUCT>Marsyas</PRODUCT> and the winding <PRODUCT>Maeander</PRODUCT> (23) were consumed with fire; the decayed walls of the cities crumbled into dust at the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> stroke of an enemy; the trembling inhabitants escaped from a bloody massacre to the shores of the Hellespont; and a considerable part of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor was desolated by the rebellion of Tribigild.
 His rapid progress was checked by the resistance of the peasants of Pamphylia; and the Ostrogoths, attacked in a narrow pass between the city of <GPE>Selgae</GPE> (24) a deep morass, and the craggy cliffs of Mount Taurus, were defeated with the loss of their bravest troops.
 But the spirit of their chief was not daunted by misfortune, and his army was continually recruited by swarms of barbarians and outlaws who were desirous of exercising the profession of robbery under the more honourable names of war and conquest.
 The rumours of the success of <PERSON>Tribigild</PERSON> might for some time be suppressed by fear, or disguised by flattery; yet they gradually alarmed both the court and the capital.
 Every misfortune was exaggerated in dark and doubtful hints, and the future designs of the rebels became the subject of anxious conjecture.
 Whenever <PERSON>Tribigild</PERSON> advanced into the inland country, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were inclined to suppose that he meditated the passage of Mount <LOC>Taurus</LOC> and the invasion of Syria.
 If he descended towards the sea, they imputed, and perhaps suggested, to the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> chief the more dangerous project of arming a fleet in the harbours of Ionia, and of extending his depredations along the maritime coast, from the mouth of the <LOC>Nile</LOC> to the port of Constantinople.
 The approach of danger and the obstinacy of Tribigild, who refused all terms of accommodation, compelled <PERSON>Eutropius</PERSON> to summon a council of war.
 (25) After claiming for himself the privilege of a veteran soldier, the eunuch intrusted the guard of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> to <PERSON>Gainas</PERSON> the Goth, and the command of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> army to his favourite Leo; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals who differently but effectually promoted the cause of the rebels.
 Leo, (26) who from the bulk of his body and the dullness of his mind was surnamed the <PRODUCT>Ajax</PRODUCT> of the East, had deserted his original trade of a woolcomber, to exercise with much less skill and success the military profession; and his uncertain operations were capriciously framed and executed with an ignorance of real difficulties and a timorous neglect of every favourable opportunity.
 The rashness of the <NORP>Ostrogoths</NORP> had drawn them into a disadvantageous position between the rivers <LOC>Melas</LOC> and Eurymedon, where they were almost besieged by the peasants of Pamphylia; but the arrival of an <NORP>Imperial</NORP> army, instead of completing their destruction, afforded the means of safety and victory.
 <PERSON>Tribigild</PERSON> surprised the unguarded camp of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> in the darkness of the night, seduced the faith of the greater part of the barbarian auxiliaries, and dissipated without much effort the troops which had been corrupted by the relaxation of discipline and the luxury of the capital.
 The discontent of Gainas, who had so boldly contrived and executed the death of Rufinus, was irritated by the fortune of his unworthy successor; he accused his own dishonourable patience under the servile reign of an eunuch; and the ambitious <NORP>Goth</NORP> was convicted, at least in the public opinion, of secretly fomenting the revolt of Tribigild, with whom he was connected by a domestic as well as by a national alliance.
 (27) When <PERSON>Gainas</PERSON> passed the Hellespont, to unite under his standard the remains of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> troops, he skilfully adapted his motions to the wishes of the Ostrogoths, abandoning by his retreat the country which they desired to invade, or facilitating by his approach the desertion of the barbarian auxiliaries.
 To the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court he repeatedly magnified the valour, the genius, the inexhaustible resources of Tribigild, confessed his own inability to prosecute the war, and extorted the permission of negotiating with his invincible adversary.
 The conditions of peace were dictated by the haughty rebel, and the peremptory demand of the head of <PERSON>Eutropius</PERSON> revealed the author and the design of this hostile conspiracy.
 Fall of Eutropius, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>399</CARDINAL> The bold satirist, who has indulged his discontent by the partial and passionate censure of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperors, violates the dignity rather than the truth of history by comparing the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of those harmless and simple animals who scarcely feel that they are the property of their shepherd.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> passions, however—fear and conjugal affection—awakened the languid soul of Arcadius: he was terrified by the threats of a victorious barbarian, and he yielded to the tender eloquence of his wife Eudoxia, who, with a flood of artificial tears, presenting her infant children to their father, implored his justice for some real or imaginary insult which she imputed to the audacious eunuch.
 (28) The emperor's hand was directed to sign the condemnation of Eutropius; the magic spell, which during four years had bound the prince and the people, was instantly dissolved; and the acclamations that so lately hailed the merit and fortune of the favourite were converted into the clamours of the soldiers and people, who reproached his crimes and pressed his immediate execution.
 In this hour of distress and despair his only refuge was in the sanctuary of the church, whose privileges he had wisely, or profanely, attempted to circumscribe; and the most eloquent of the saints, <PERSON>John</PERSON> Chrysostom, enjoyed the triumph of protecting a prostrate minister, whose choice had raised him to the ecclesiastical throne of Constantinople.
 The archbishop, ascending the pulpit of the cathedral that he might be distinctly seen and heard by an innumerable crowd of either sex and of every age, pronounced a seasonable and pathetic discourse on the forgiveness of injuries and the instability of human greatness.
 The agonies of the pale and affrighted wretch, who lay grovelling under the table of the altar, exhibited a solemn and instructive spectacle; and the orator, who was afterwards accused of insulting the misfortunes of Eutropius, laboured to excite the contempt, that he might assuage the fury, of the people.
 (29) The powers of humanity, of superstition, and of eloquence prevailed.
 The empress <PERSON>Eudoxia</PERSON> was restrained, by her own prejudices or by those of her subjects, from violating the sanctuary of the church; and <PERSON>Eutropius</PERSON> was tempted to capitulate, by the milder arts of persuasion, and by an oath that his life should be spared.
 (30) Careless of the dignity of their sovereign, the new ministers of the palace immediately published an edict, to declare that his late favourite had disgraced the names of consul and patrician, to abolish his statues, to ,confiscate his wealth, and to inflict a perpetual exile in the island of Cyprus.
 (31) A despicable and decrepit eunuch could no longer alarm the fears of his enemies; nor was he capable of enjoying what yet remained - the comforts of peace, of solitude, and of a happy climate.
 But their implacable revenge still envied him the last moments of a miserable life, and <PERSON>Eutropius</PERSON> had no sooner touched the shores of <GPE>Cyprus</GPE> than he was hastily recalled.
 The vain hope of eluding, by a change of place, the obligation of an oath, engaged the empress to transfer the scene of his trial and execution from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to the adjacent suburb of Chalcedon.
 The consul <NORP>Aurelian</NORP> pronounced the sentence; and the motives of that sentence expose the jurisprudence of a despotic government.
 The crimes which <PERSON>Eutropius</PERSON> had committed against the people might have justified his death; but he was found guilty of harnessing to his chariot the sacred animals, who, from their breed or colour, were reserved for the use of the emperor alone.
 (32) Conspiracy and fall of Gainas, A.
D.
 400 While this domestic revolution was transacted, <PERSON>Gainas</PERSON> (33) openly revolted from his allegiance, united his forces at <GPE>Thyatira</GPE> in <PERSON>Lydia</PERSON> with those of Tribigild, and still maintained his superior ascendant over the rebellious leader of the Ostrogoths.
 The confederate armies advanced without resistance to the straits of the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> and the Bosphorus, and <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> was instructed to prevent the loss of his <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> dominions by resigning his authority and his person to the faith of the barbarians.
 The church of the holy martyr Euphemia, situate on a lofty eminence near Chalcedon, (34) was chosen for the place of the interview.
 <PERSON>Gainas</PERSON> bowed with reverence at the feet of the emperor, whilst he required the sacrifice of <NORP>Aurelian</NORP> and Saturninus, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ministers of consular rank and their naked necks were exposed by the haughty rebel to the edge of the sword, till he condescended to grant them a precarious and disgraceful respite.
 The Goths, according to the terms of the agreement, were immediately transported from <LOC>Asia</LOC> into Europe; and the victorious chief, who accepted the title of master-general of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies, soon filled <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with his troops, and distributed among his dependents the honours and rewards of the empire.
 In his early youth <PERSON>Gainas</PERSON> had passed the <LOC>Danube</LOC> as a suppliant and a fugitive: his elevation had been the work of valour and fortune, and his indiscreet or perfidious conduct was the cause of his rapid downfall.
 Notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of the archbishop, he importunately claimed for his <NORP>Arian</NORP> sectaries the possession of a peculiar church, and the pride of the catholics was offended by the public toleration of heresy.
 (35) Every quarter of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was filled with tumult and disorder; and the barbarians gazed with such ardour on the rich shops of the jewellers and the tables of the bankers which were covered with gold and silver, that it was judged prudent to remove those dangerous temptations from their sight.
 They resented the injurious precaution; and some alarming attempts were made during the night July <CARDINAL>20</CARDINAL> to attack and destroy with fire the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> palace.
 (36) In this state of mutual and suspicious hostility, the guards and the people of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> shut the gates, and rose in arms to prevent or to punish the conspiracy of the Goths.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Gainas</PERSON> his troops were surprised and oppressed; seven thousand barbarians perished in this bloody massacre.
 In the fury of the pursuit the catholics uncovered the roof, and continued to throw down flaming logs of wood till they overwhelmed their adversaries, who had retreated to the church or conventicle of the Arians.
 <PERSON>Gainas</PERSON> was either innocent of the design or too confident of his success; he was astonished by the intelligence that the flower of his army had been ingloriously destroyed; that he himself was declared a public enemy; and that his countryman Fravitta, a brave and loyal confederate, had assumed the management of the war by sea and land.
 The enterprises of the rebel against the cities of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> were encountered by a firm and well-ordered defence: his hungry soldiers were soon reduced to the grass that grew on the margin of the fortifications; and Gainas, who vainly regretted the wealth and luxury of Asia, embraced a desperate resolution of forcing the passage of the Hellespont.
 He was destitute of vessels, but the woods of the <PRODUCT>Chersonesus</PRODUCT> afforded materials for rafts, and his intrepid barbarians did not refuse to trust themselves to the waves.
 December 23.
But <PERSON>Fravitta</PERSON> attentively watched the progress of their undertaking.
 As soon as they had gained the middle of the stream, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> galleys, (37) impelled by the full force of oars, of the current, and of a favourable wind, rushed forwards in compact order and with irresistible weight, and the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> was covered with the fragments of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> shipwreck.
 After the destruction of his hopes and the loss of many thousands of his bravest soldiers, Gainas, who could no longer aspire to govern or to subdue the Romans, determined to resume the independence of a savage life.
 A light and active body of barbarian horse, disengaged from their infantry and baggage, might perform in <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> or ten days a march of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles from the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> to the Danube; (38) the garrisons of that important frontier had been gradually annihilated; the river in the month of December would be deeply frozen; and the unbounded prospect of <PERSON>Scythia</PERSON> was open to the ambition of Gainas.
 This design was secretly communicated to the national troops, who devoted themselves to the fortunes of their leader; and before the signal of departure was given, a great number of provincial auxiliaries, whom he suspected of an attachment to their native country, were perfidiously massacred.
 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> advanced by rapid marches through the plains of Thrace, and they were soon delivered from the fear of pursuit by the vanity of Fravitta, who, instead of extinguishing the war, hastened to enjoy the popular applause, and to assume the peaceful honours of the consulship.
 But a formidable ally appeared in arms to vindicate the majesty of the empire, and to guard the peace and liberty of Scythia.
 (39) The superior forces of Uldin, king of the Huns, opposed the progress of Gainas; an hostile and ruined country prohibited his retreat; he disdained to capitulate; and after repeatedly attempting to cut his way through the ranks of the enemy, A.
D.
 401, January 3.
 he was slain, with his desperate followers, in the field of battle.
 Eleven days after the naval victory of the Hellespont, the head of Gainas, the inestimable gift of the conqueror, was received at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the most liberal expressions of gratitude; and the public deliverance was celebrated by festivals and illuminations.
 The triumphs of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> became the subject of epic poems; (40) and the monarch, no longer oppressed by any hostile terrors, resigned himself to the mild and absolute dominion of his wife, the fair and artful Eudoxia, who has sullied her fame by the persecution of St.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> Chrysostom.
 Election and merit of Chrysostom, A.
D.
 398, February <DATE>26</DATE> After the death of the indolent Nectarius, the successor of Gregory Nazianzen, the church of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was distracted by the ambition of rival candidates, who were not ashamed to solicit, with gold or flattery, the suffrage of the people or of the favourite.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Eutropius</PERSON> seems to have deviated from his ordinary maxims; and his uncorrupted judgment was determined only by the superior merit of a stranger.
 In a late journey into the <LOC>East</LOC> he had admired the sermons of John, a native and presbyter of Antioch, whose name has been distinguished by the epithet of Chrysostom, or the Golden Mouth.
 (41) A private order was despatched to the governor of Syria; and as the people might be unwilling to resign their favourite preacher, he was transported, with speed and secrecy, in a postchariot, from <GPE>Antioch</GPE> to Constantinople.
 The unanimous and unsolicited consent of the court, the clergy, and the people ratified the choice of the minister; and, both as a saint and as an orator, the new archbishop surpassed the sanguine expectations of the public.
 Born of a noble and opulent family in the capital of Syria, <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> had been educated, by the care of a tender mother, under the tuition of the most skilful masters.
 He studied the art of rhetoric in the school of Libanius; and that celebrated sophist, who soon discovered the talents of his disciple, ingenuously confessed that <PERSON>John</PERSON> would have deserved to succeed him had he not been stolen away by the Christians.
 His piety soon disposed him to receive the sacrament of baptism; to renounce the lucrative and honourable profession of the law; and to bury himself in the adjacent desert, where he subdued the lusts of the flesh by an austere penance of six years.
 His infirmities compelled him to return to the society of mankind; and the authority of <PERSON>Meletius</PERSON> devoted his talents to the service of the church: but in the midst of his family, and afterwards on the archiepiscopal throne, <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> still persevered in the practice of the monastic virtues.
 The ample revenues, which his predecessors had consumed in pomp and luxury, he diligently applied to the establishment of hospitals; and the multitudes who were supported by his charity preferred the eloquent and edifying discourses of their archbishop to the amusements of the theatre or the circus.
 The monuments of that eloquence, which was admired near twenty years at <GPE>Antioch</GPE> and Constantinople, have been carefully preserved; and the possession of near <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand sermons or homilies has authorised the critics (42) of succeeding times to appreciate the genuine merit of Chrysostom.
 They unanimously attribute to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> orator the free command of an elegant and copious language; the judgment to conceal the advantages which he derived from the knowledge of rhetoric and philosophy; an inexhaustible fund of metaphors and similitudes, of ideas and images, to vary and illustrate the most familiar topics; the happy art of engaging the passions in the service of virtue, and of exposing the folly as well as the turpitude of vice almost with the truth and spirit of a dramatic representation.
 His administration and defects, A.
D.
 398-403.
 The pastoral labours of the archbishop of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> provoked and gradually united against him <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sorts of enemies; the aspiring clergy, who envied his success, and the obstinate sinners, who were offended by his reproofs.
 When <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> thundered from the pulpit of St.
 Sophia against the degeneracy of the Christians, his shafts were spent among the crowd, without wounding or even marking the character of any individual.
 When he declaimed against the peculiar vices of the rich, poverty might obtain a transient consolation from his invectives: but the guilty were still sheltered by their numbers; and the reproach itself was dignified by some ideas of superiority and enjoyment.
 But as the pyramid rose towards the summit, it insensibly diminished to a point; and the magistrates, the ministers, the favourite eunuchs, the ladies of the court, (43) the empress <PERSON>Eudoxia</PERSON> herself, had a much larger share of guilt to divide among a smaller proportion of criminals.
 The personal applications of the audience were anticipated or confirmed by the testimony of their own conscience; and the intrepid preacher assumed the dangerous right of exposing both the offence and the offender to the public abhorrence.
 The secret resentment of the court encouraged the discontent of the clergy and monks of Constantinople, who were too hastily reformed by the fervent zeal of their archbishop.
 He had condemned from the pulpit the domestic females of the clergy of Constantinople, who, under the name of servants or sisters, afforded a perpetual occasion either of sin or of scandal.
 The silent and solitary ascetics, who had secluded themselves from the world, were entitled to the warmest approbation of Chrysostom; but he despised and stigmatised, as the disgrace of their holy profession, the crowd of degenerate monks, who, from some unworthy motives of pleasure or profit, so frequently infested the streets of the capital.
 To the voice of persuasion the archbishop was obliged to add the terrors of authority; and his ardour in the exercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction was not always exempt from passion; nor was it always guided by prudence.
 <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> was naturally of a choleric disposition.
 (44) Although he struggled, according to the precepts of the Gospel, to love his private enemies, he indulged himself in the privilege of hating the enemies of God and of the church; and his sentiments were sometimes delivered with too much energy of countenance and expression.
 He still maintained, from some considerations of health or abstinence, his former habits of taking his repasts alone; and this inhospitable custom, (45) which his enemies imputed to pride, contributed at least to nourish the infirmity of a morose and unsocial humour.
 Separated from that familiar intercourse which facilitates the knowledge and the despatch of business, he reposed an unsuspecting confidence in his deacon Serapion; and seldom applied his speculative knowledge of human nature to the particular characters either of his dependents or of his equals.
 Conscious of the purity of his intentions, and perhaps of the superiority of his genius, the archbishop of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> extended the jurisdiction of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, that he might enlarge the sphere of his pastoral labours; and the conduct which the profane imputed to an ambitious motive, appeared to <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> himself in the light of a sacred and indispensable duty.
 In his visitation through the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> provinces he deposed <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> bishops of <PERSON>Lydia</PERSON> and Phrygia; and indiscreetly declared that a deep corruption of simony and licentiousness had infected the whole episcopal order.
 (46) If those bishops were innocent, such a rash and unjust condemnation must excite a well-grounded discontent.
 If they were guilty, the numerous associates of their guilt would soon discover that their own safety depended on the ruin of the archbishop, whom they studied to represent as the tyrant of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> church.
 <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> is persecuted by the empress Eudocia, A.
D.
 403.
 This ecclesiastical conspiracy was managed by Theophilus, (47) archbishop of Alexandria, an active and ambitious prelate, who displayed the fruits of rapine in monuments of ostentation.
 His national dislike to the rising greatness of a city which degraded him from the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> to the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> rank in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world was exasperated by some personal disputes with <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> himself.
 (48) By the private invitation of the empress, <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> landed at Constantinople, with a stout body of <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> mariners, to encounter the populace; and a train of dependent bishops, to secure by their voices the majority of a synod.
 The synod (49) was convened in the suburb of Chalcedon, surnamed the oak, where <GPE>Rufinus</GPE> had erected a stately church and monastery; and their proceedings were continued during fourteen days or sessions.
 A bishop and a deacon accused the archbishop of Constantinople; but the frivolous or improbable nature of the <CARDINAL>forty-seven</CARDINAL> articles which they presented against him may justly be considered as a fair and unexceptionable panegyric.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> successive summons were signified to Chrysostom; but he still refused to trust either his person or his reputation in the hands of his implacable enemies, who, prudently declining the examination of any particular charges, condemned his contumacious disobedience, and hastily pronounced a sentence of deposition.
 The synod of the oak immediately addressed the emperor to ratify and execute their judgment, and charitably insinuated that the penalties of treason might be inflicted on the audacious preacher, who had reviled, under the name of Jezebel, the empress <PERSON>Eudoxia</PERSON> herself.
 The archbishop was rudely arrested, and conducted through the city, by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> messengers, who landed him, after a short navigation, near the entrance of the Euxine; from whence, before the expiration of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days, he was gloriously recalled.
 Popular tumult at Constantinople.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> astonishment of his faithful people had been mute and passive: they suddenly rose with unanimous and irresistible fury.
 <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> escaped, but the promiscuous crowd of monks and <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> mariners was slaughtered without pity in the streets of Constantinople.
 (50) A seasonable earthquake justified the interposition of Heaven; the torrent of sedition rolled forwards to the gates of the palace; and the empress, agitated by fear or remorse, threw herself at the feet of Arcadius, and confessed that the public safety could be purchased only by the restoration of Chrysostom.
 The <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> was covered with innumerable vessels; the shores of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> were profusely illuminated; and the acclamations of a victorious people accompanied, from the port to the cathedral, the triumph of the archbishop, who too easily consented to resume the exercise of his functions, before his sentence had been legally reversed by the authority of an ecclesiastical synod.
 Ignorant, or careless, of the impending danger, <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> indulged his zeal, or perhaps his resentment; declaimed with peculiar asperity against female vices; and condemned the profane honours which were addressed, almost in the precincts of St.
 Sophia, to the statue of the empress.
 His imprudence tempted his enemies to inflame the haughty Spirit of Eudoxia, by reporting, or perhaps inventing, the famous exordium of a sermon, "Herodias is again furious; <PERSON>Herodias</PERSON> again dances; she once more requires the head of John:" an insolent allusion, which, as a woman and a sovereign, it was impossible for her to forgive.
 (51) The short interval of a perfidious truce was employed to concert more effectual measures for the disgrace and ruin of the archbishop.
 A numerous council of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> prelates, who were guided from a distance by the advice of Theophilus, confirmed the validity, without examining the justice, of the former sentence; and a detachment of barbarian troops was introduced into the city, to suppress the emotions of the people.
 On the vigil of <DATE>Easter</DATE> the solemn administration of baptism was rudely interrupted by the soldiers, who alarmed the modesty of the naked catechumens, and violated, by their presence, the awful mysteries of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 <PERSON>Arsacius</PERSON> occupied the church of St.
 Sophia and the archiepiscopal throne.
 The <NORP>Catholics</NORP> retreated to the baths of Constantine, and afterwards to the fields, where they were still pursued and insulted by the guards, the bishops, and the magistrates.
 The fatal day of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and final exile of <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> was marked by the conflagration of the cathedral, of the senate-house, and of the adjacent buildings; and this calamity was imputed, without proof, but not without probability, to the despair of a persecuted faction.
 (52) Exile of Chrysostom, A.
D.
 404, June 20.
 <PERSON>Cicero</PERSON> might claim some merit if his voluntary banishment preserved the peace of the republic; (53) but the submission of a <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> was the indispensable duty of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> and a subject.
 Instead of listening to his humble prayer that he might be permitted to reside at <GPE>Cyzicus</GPE> or Nicomedia, the inflexible empress assigned for his exile the remote and desolate town of Cucusus, among the ridges of Mount Taurus, in the Lesser Armenia.
 A secret hope was entertained that the archbishop might perish in a difficult and dangerous march of seventy days in the heat of summer, through the provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, where he was continually threatened by the hostile attacks of the Isaurians, and the more implacable fury of the monks.
 Yet <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> arrived in safety at the place of his confinement; and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years which he spent at Cucusus, and the neighbouring town of Arabissus, were the last and most glorious of his life.
 His character was consecrated by absence and persecution; the faults of his administration were no longer remembered; but every tongue repeated the praises of his genius and virtue: and the respectful attention of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world was fixed on a desert spot among the mountains of Taurus.
 From that solitude the archbishop, whose active mind was invigorated by misfortunes, maintained a strict and frequent correspondence (54) with the most distant provinces; exhorted the separate congregation of his faithful adherents to persevere in their allegiance; urged the destruction of the temples of Phoenicia, and the extirpation of heresy in the isle of Cyprus; extended his pastoral care to the missions of <GPE>Persia</GPE> and Scythia; negotiated, by his ambassadors, with the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff and the emperor Honorius; and boldly appealed, from a partial synod, to the supreme tribunal of a free and general council.
 The mind of the illustrious exile was still independent; but his captive body was exposed to the revenge of the oppressors, who continued to abuse the name and authority of Arcadius.
 (55) An order was despatched for the instant removal of <PERSON>Chrysostom</PERSON> to the extreme desert of Pityus: and his guards so faithfully obeyed their cruel instructions, that, before he reached the seacoast of the Euxine, His death, A.
D.
 407, September 14.
 he expired at Comana, in Pontus, in the sixtieth year of his age.
 The succeeding generation acknowledged his innocence and merit.
 The archbishops of the East, who might blush that their predecessors had been the enemies of Chrysostom, were gradually disposed, by the firmness of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, to restore the honours of that venerable name.
 (56) At the pious solicitation of the clergy and people of Constantinople, His relics transported to Constantinople, A.
D.
 438, January <CARDINAL>27</CARDINAL> his relics, thirty years after his death, were transported from their obscure sepulchre to the royal city.
 (57) The emperor <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> advanced to receive them as far as Chalcedon; and, falling prostrate on the coffin, implored, in the name of his guilty parents, <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> and Eudoxia, the forgiveness of the injured saint.
 (58) The death of Arcadius, A.
D.
 408, May 1.
 Yet a reasonable doubt may be entertained whether any stain of hereditary guilt could be derived from <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> to his successor.
 <PERSON>Eudoxia</PERSON> was a young and beautiful woman, who indulged her passions and despised her husband: Count <PERSON>John</PERSON> enjoyed, at least, the familiar confidence of the empress; and the public named him as the real father of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> the younger.
 (59) The birth of a son was accepted, however, by the pious husband as an event the most fortunate and honourable to himself, to his family, and to the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> world: and the royal infant, by an unprecedented favour, was invested with the titles of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Augustus.
 In less than four years afterwards, Eudoxia, in the bloom of youth, was destroyed by the consequences of a miscarriage; and this untimely death confounded the prophecy of a holy bishop, (60) who, amidst the universal joy, had ventured to foretell that she should behold the long and auspicious reign of her glorious son.
 The catholics applauded the justice of Heaven, which avenged the persecution of St.
 Chrysostom; and perhaps the emperor was the only person who sincerely bewailed the loss of the haughty and rapacious Eudoxia.
 Such a domestic misfortune afflicted him more deeply than the public calamities of the <LOC>East</LOC> (61)—the licentious excursions, from <GPE>Pontus</GPE> to Palestine, of the <NORP>Isaurian</NORP> robbers, whose impunity accused the weakness of the government; and the earthquakes, the conflagrations, the famine, and the flights of locusts, (62) which the popular discontent was equally disposed to attribute to the incapacity of the monarch.
 At length, in the thirty-first year of his age, after a reign (if we may abuse that word) of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> years, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months, and fifteen days, <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> expired in the palace of Constantinople.
 It is impossible to delineate his character; since, in a period very copiously furnished with historical materials, it has not been possible to remark <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> action that properly belongs to the son of the great Theodosius.
 His supposed testament.
 The historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (63) has indeed illuminated the mind of the dying emperor with a ray of human prudence, or celestial wisdom.
 <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> considered, with anxious foresight, the helpless condition of his son Theodosius, who was no more than seven years of age, the dangerous factions of a minority, and the aspiring spirit of Jezdegerd, the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch.
 Instead of tempting the allegiance of an ambitious subject by the participation of supreme power, he boldly appealed to the magnanimity of a king, and placed, by a solemn testament, the sceptre of the <LOC>East</LOC> in the hands of <PERSON>Jezdegerd</PERSON> himself.
 The royal guardian accepted and discharged this honourable trust with unexampled fidelity; and the infancy of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> was protected by the arms and councils of Persia.
 Such is the singular narrative of Procopius; and his veracity is not disputed by Agathias, (64) while he presumes to dissent from his judgment, and to arraign the wisdom of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperor, who so rashly, though so fortunately, committed his son and his dominions to the unknown faith of a stranger, a rival, and a heathen.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty years, this political question might be debated in the court of Justinian; but a prudent historian will refuse to examine the propriety, till he has ascertained the truth, of the testament of Arcadius.
 As it stands without a parallel in the history of the world, we may justly require that it should be attested by the positive and unanimous evidence of contemporaries.
 The strange novelty of the event, which excites our distrust, must have attracted their notice; and their universal silence annihilates the vain tradition of the succeeding age.
 Administration of Anthemius, A.
D.
 408-415.
 The maxims of <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence, if they could fairly be transferred from private property to public dominion, would have adjudged to the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> the guardianship of his nephew, till he had attained, at least, the fourteenth year of his age.
 But the weakness of Honorius, and the calamities of his reign, disqualified him from prosecuting this natural claim; and such was the absolute separation of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> monarchies, both in interest and affection, that <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> would have obeyed with less reluctance the orders of the Persian, than those of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> court.
 Under a prince whose weakness is disguised by the external signs of manhood and discretion, the most worthless favourites may secretly dispute the empire of the palace, and dictate to submissive provinces the commands of a master whom they direct and despise.
 But the ministers of a child, who is incapable of arming them with the sanction of the royal name, must acquire and exercise an independent authority.
 The great officers of the state and army, who had been appointed before the death of Arcadius, formed an aristocracy which might have inspired them with the idea of a free republic; and the government of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire was fortunately assumed by the praefect Anthemius, (65) who obtained, by his superior abilities, a lasting ascendant over the minds of his equals.
 The safety of the young emperor proved the merit and integrity of Anthemius; and his prudent firmness sustained the force and reputation of an infant reign.
 Uldin, with a formidable host of barbarians, was encamped in the heart of Thrace; he proudly rejected all terms of accommodation; and, pointing to the rising sun, declared to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassadors that the course of that planet should alone terminate the conquests of the Huns.
 But the desertion of his confederates, who were privately convinced of the justice and liberality of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, obliged <PERSON>Uldin</PERSON> to repass the Danube: the tribe of the Scyrri, which composed his rearguard, was almost extirpated; and many thousand captives were dispersed, to cultivate, with servile labour, the fields of Asia.
 (66) In the midst of the public triumph, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was protected by a strong enclosure of new and more extensive walls; the same vigilant care was applied to restore the fortifications of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> cities; and a plan was judiciously conceived, which, in the space of seven years, would have secured the command of the Danube, by establishing on that river a perpetual fleet of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty armed vessels.
 (67) Character and administration of Pulcheria, A.
D.
 414-453.
 But the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had so long been accustomed to the authority of a monarch, that the first, even among the females of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> family, who displayed any courage or capacity, was permitted to ascend the vacant throne of Theodosius.
 His sister Pulcheria, (68) who was only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years older than himself, received at the age of <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> the title of Augusta; and though her favour might be sometimes clouded by caprice or intrigue, she continued to govern the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire near forty years; during the long minority of her brother, and after his death in her own name, and in the name of Marcian, her nominal husband.
 From a motive either of prudence or religion, she embraced a life of celibacy; and notwithstanding some aspersions on the chastity of Pulcheria, (69) this resolution, which she communicated to her sisters <PERSON>Arcadia</PERSON> and Marina, was celebrated by the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world as the sublime effort of heroic piety.
 In the presence of the clergy and people the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> daughters of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> (70) dedicated their virginity to God; and the obligation of their solemn vow was inscribed on a tablet of gold and gems, which they publicly offered in the great church of Constantinople.
 Their palace was converted into a monastery, and all males except the guides of their conscience, the saints who had forgotten the distinction of sexes—were scrupulously excluded from the holy threshold.
 Pulcheria, her <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sisters, and a chosen train of favourite damsels, formed a religious community: they renounced the vanity of dress, interrupted by frequent fasts their simple and frugal diet, allotted a portion of their time to works of embroidery, and devoted several hours of the day and night to the exercises of prayer and psalmody.
 The piety of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> virgin was adorned by the zeal and liberality of an empress.
 Ecclesiastical history describes the splendid churches which were built at the expense of <PERSON>Pulcheria</PERSON> in all the provinces of the East, her charitable foundations for the benefit of strangers and the poor, the ample donations which she assigned for the perpetual maintenance of monastic societies, and the active severity with which she laboured to suppress the opposite heresies of <PERSON>Nestorius</PERSON> and Eutyches.
 Such virtues were supposed to deserve the peculiar favour of the Deity: and the relics of martyrs, as well as the knowledge of future events, were communicated in visions and revelations to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> saint.
 (71) Yet the devotion of <PERSON>Pulcheria</PERSON> never diverted her indefatigable attention from temporal affairs; and she alone, among all the descendants of the great Theodosius, appears to have inherited any share of his manly spirit and abilities.
 The elegant and familiar use which she had acquired both of the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> and <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> languages was readily applied to the various occasions of speaking or writing on public business: her deliberations were maturely weighed; her actions were prompt and decisive; and while she moved without noise or ostentation the wheel of government, she discreetly attributed to the genius of the emperor the long tranquillity of his reign.
 In the last years of his peaceful life <LOC>Europe</LOC> was indeed afflicted by the arms of Attila; but the more extensive provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> still continued to enjoy a profound and permanent repose.
 <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> the younger was never reduced to the disgraceful necessity of encountering and punishing a rebellious subject: and since we cannot applaud the vigour, some praise may be due to the mildness and prosperity, of the administration of Pulcheria.
 Education and character of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> the younger.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> world was deeply interested in the education of its master.
 A regular course of study and exercise was judiciously instituted; of the military exercises of riding, and shooting with the bow; of the liberal studies of grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy: the most skilful masters of the <LOC>East</LOC> ambitiously solicited the attention of their royal pupil, and several noble youths were introduced into the palace to animate his diligence by the emulation of friendship.
 <PERSON>Pulcheria</PERSON> alone discharged the important task of instructing her brother in the arts of government; but her precepts may countenance some suspicion of the extent of her capacity or of the purity of her intentions.
 She taught him to maintain a grave and majestic deportment; to walk, to hold his robes, to seat himself on his throne in a manner worthy of a great prince; to abstain from laughter, to listen with condescension, to return suitable answers; to assume by turns a serious or a placid countenance; in a word, to represent with grace and dignity the external figure of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 But <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> (72) was never excited to support the weight and glory of an illustrious name; and, instead of aspiring to imitate his ancestors, he degenerated (if we may presume to measure the degrees of incapacity) below the weakness of his father and his uncle.
 <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> had been assisted by the guardian care of a parent, whose lessons were enforced by his authority and example.
 But the unfortunate prince who is born in the purple must remain a stranger to the voice of truth; and the son of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> was condemned to pass his perpetual infancy encompassed only by a servile train of women and eunuchs.
 The ample leisure which he acquired by neglecting the essential duties of his high office was filled by idle amusements and unprofitable studies.
 Hunting was the only active pursuit that could tempt him beyond the limits of the palace; but he most assiduously laboured, sometimes by the light of a midnight lamp, in the mechanic occupations of painting and carving; and the elegance with which he transcribed religious books entitled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor to the singular epithet of Calligraphes, or a fair writer.
 Separated from the world by an impenetrable veil, <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> trusted the persons whom he loved; he loved those who were accustomed to amuse and flatter his indolence, and as he never perused the papers that were presented for the royal signature, the acts of injustice the most repugnant to his character were frequently perpetrated in his name.
 The emperor himself was chaste, temperate, liberal, and merciful; but these qualities—which can only deserve the name of virtues when they are supported by courage and regulated by discretion—were seldom beneficial, and they some times proved mischievous, to mankind.
 His mind, enervated by a royal education, was oppressed and degraded by abject superstition: he fasted, he sung psalms, he blindly accepted the miracles and doctrines with which his faith was continually nourished.
 <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> devoutly worshipped the dead and living saints of the catholic church; and he once refused to eat till an insolent monk, who had cast an excommunication on his sovereign, condescended to heal the spiritual wound which he had inflicted.
 (73) Character and adventures of the empress Eudocia, A.
D.
 421-460.
 The story of a fair and virtuous maiden, exalted from a private condition to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> throne, might be deemed an incredible romance, if such a romance had not been verified in the marriage of Theodosius.
 The celebrated <PERSON>Athenais</PERSON> (74) was educated by her father <PERSON>Leontius</PERSON> in the religion and sciences of the Greeks; and so advantageous was the opinion which the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> philosopher entertained of his contemporaries, that he divided his patrimony between his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, bequeathing to his daughter a small legacy of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, in the lively confidence that her beauty and merit would be a sufficient portion.
 The jealousy and avarice of her brothers soon compelled <PERSON>Athenais</PERSON> to seek a refuge at Constantinople, and with some hopes, either of justice or favour, to throw herself at the feet of Pulcheria.
 That sagacious princess listened to her eloquent complaint, and secretly destined the daughter of the philosopher <PERSON>Leontius</PERSON> for the future wife of the emperor of the East, who had now attained the twentieth year of his age.
 She easily excited the curiosity of her brother by an interesting picture of the charms of Athenais: large eyes, a well-proportioned nose, a fair complexion, golden locks, a slender person, a graceful demeanour, an understanding improved by study, and a virtue tried by distress.
 Theodosius, concealed behind a curtain in the apartment of his sister, was permitted to behold the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> virgin: the modest youth immediately declared his pure and honourable love, and the royal nuptials were celebrated amidst the acclamations of the capital and the provinces.
 Athenais, who was easily persuaded to renounce the errors of Paganism, received at her baptism the <NORP>Christian</NORP> name of <PERSON>Eudocia</PERSON> but the cautious <PERSON>Pulcheria</PERSON> withheld the title of <PERSON>Augusta</PERSON> till the wife of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> had approved her fruitfulness by the birth of a daughter, who espoused fifteen years afterwards the emperor of the West.
 The brothers of <PERSON>Eudocia</PERSON> obeyed, with some anxiety, her <NORP>Imperial</NORP> summons; but as she could easily forgive their fortunate unkindness, she indulged the tenderness, or perhaps the vanity, of a sister, by promoting them to the rank of consuls and praefects.
 In the luxury of the palace she still cultivated those ingenuous arts which had contributed to her greatness, and wisely dedicated her talents to the honour of religion and of her husband.
 <PERSON>Eudocia</PERSON> composed a poetical paraphrase of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> books of the Old Testament and of the prophecies of <PERSON>Daniel</PERSON> and Zechariah; a cento of the verses of Homer, applied to the life and miracles of Christ, the legend of St.
 Cyprian, and a panegyric on the <NORP>Persian</NORP> victories of Theodosius; and her writings, which were applauded by a servile and superstitious age, have not been disdained by the candour of impartial criticism.
 (75) The fondness of the emperor was not abated by time and possession; and Eudocia, after the marriage of her daughter, was permitted to discharge her grateful vows by a solemn pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
 Her ostentatious progress through the <LOC>East</LOC> may seem inconsistent with the spirit of <NORP>Christian</NORP> humility: she pronounced from a throne of gold and gems an eloquent oration to the senate of Antioch, declared her royal intention of enlarging the walls of the city, bestowed a donative of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds of gold to restore the public baths, and accepted the statues which were decreed by the gratitude of Antioch.
 In the Holy Land her alms and pious foundations exceeded the munificence of the great Helena; and though the public treasure might be impoverished by this excessive liberality, she enjoyed the conscious satisfaction of returning to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the chains of St.
 Peter, the right arm of St.
 Stephen, and the undoubted picture of the Virgin, painted by St.
 Luke.
 (76) But this pilgrimage was the fatal term of the glories of Eudocia.
 Satiated with empty pomp, and unmindful perhaps of her obligations to Pulcheria, she ambitiously aspired to the government of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire: the palace was distracted by female discord; but the victory was at last decided by the superior ascendant of the sister of Theodosius.
 The execution of Paulinus, master of the offices, and the disgrace of Cyrus, <PERSON>Praetorian</PERSON> praefect of the East, convinced the public that the favour of <PERSON>Eudocia</PERSON> was insufficient to protect her most faithful friends, and the uncommon beauty of <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> encouraged the secret rumour that his guilt was that of a successful lover.
 (77) As soon as the empress perceived that the affection of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> was irretrievably lost, she requested the permission of retiring to the distant solitude of Jerusalem.
 She obtained her request, but the jealousy of Theodosius, or the vindictive spirit of Pulcheria, pursued her in her last retreat; and Saturninus, count of the domestics, was directed to punish with death <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ecclesiastics, her most favoured servants.
 <PERSON>Eudocia</PERSON> instantly revenged them by the assassination of the count: the furious passions which she indulged on this suspicious occasion seemed to justify the severity of Theodosius; and the empress, ignominiously stripped of the honours of her rank, (78) was disgraced, perhaps unjustly, in the eyes of the world.
 The remainder of the life of Eudocia, about <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> years, was spent in exile and devotion; and the approach of age, the death of Theodosius, the misfortunes of her only daughter, who was led a captive from <GPE>Rome</GPE> to Carthage, and the society of the Holy Monks of Palestine, insensibly confirmed the religious temper of her mind.
 After a full experience of the vicissitudes of human life, the daughter of the philosopher <PERSON>Leontius</PERSON> expired at Jerusalem, in the sixty-seventh year of her age; protesting with her dying breath that she had never transgressed the bounds of innocence and friendship.
 (79) The <NORP>Persian</NORP> war, A.
D.
 422.
 The gentle mind of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> was never inflamed by the ambition of conquest or military renown; and the slight alarm of a <NORP>Persian</NORP> war scarcely interrupted the tranquillity of the East.
 The motives of this war were just and honourable.
 In the last year of the reign of Jezdegerd, the supposed guardian of Theodosius, a bishop, who aspired to the crown of martyrdom, destroyed <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the fire-temples of Susa.
 (80) His zeal and obstinacy were revenged on his brethren: the <PERSON>Magi</PERSON> excited a cruel persecution; and the intolerant zeal of <PERSON>Jezdegerd</PERSON> was imitated by his son Varahes, or Bahram, who soon afterwards ascended the throne.
 Some <NORP>Christian</NORP> fugitives, who escaped to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> frontier, were sternly demanded, and generously refused; and the refusal, aggravated by commercial disputes, soon kindled a war between the rival monarchies.
 The mountains of Armenia, and the plains of Mesopotamia, were filled with hostile armies; but the operations of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> successive campaigns were not productive of any decisive or memorable events.
 Some engagements were fought, some towns were besieged, with various and doubtful success: and if the <NORP>Romans</NORP> failed in their attempt to recover the long-lost possession of Nisibis, the <NORP>Persians</NORP> were repulsed from the walls of a <NORP>Mesopotamian</NORP> city by the valour of a martial bishop, who pointed his thundering engine in the name of St.
 Thomas the Apostle.
 Yet the splendid victories which the incredible speed of the messenger <PERSON>Palladius</PERSON> repeatedly announced to the palace of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> were celebrated with festivals and panegyrics.
 From these panegyrics the historians (81) of the age might borrow their extraordinary, and perhaps fabulous, tales of the proud challenge of a <NORP>Persian</NORP> hero, who was entangled by the net, and despatched by the sword, of <NORP>Areobindus</NORP> the Goth; of the ten thousand Immortals, who were slain in the attack of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> camp; and of the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand Arabs, or Saracens, who were impelled by a panic terror to throw themselves headlong into the Euphrates.
 Such events may be disbelieved or disregarded; but the charity of a bishop, <PERSON>Acacius</PERSON> of Amida, whose name might have dignified the saintly calendar, shall not be lost in oblivion.
 Boldly declaring that vases of gold and silver are useless to a God who neither eats nor drinks, the generous prelate sold the plate of the church of Amida; employed the price in the redemption of seven thousand <NORP>Persian</NORP> captives; supplied their wants with affectionate liberality; and dismissed them to their native country, to inform their king of the true spirit of the religion which he persecuted.
 The practice of benevolence in the midst of war must always tend to assuage the animosity of contending nations; and I wish to persuade myself that <PERSON>Acacius</PERSON> contributed to the restoration of peace.
 In the conference which was held on the limits of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassadors degraded the personal character of their sovereign, by a vain attempt to magnify the extent of his power, when they seriously advised the <NORP>Persians</NORP> to prevent, by a timely accommodation, the wrath of a monarch who was yet ignorant of this distant war.
 A truce of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years was solemnly ratified; and although the revolutions of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> might threaten the public tranquillity, the essential conditions of this treaty were respected near four-score years by the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Artaxerxes.
 <GPE>Armenia</GPE> divided between the <NORP>Persians</NORP> and the Romans, A.

 Since the <NORP>Roman</NORP> and <NORP>Parthian</NORP> standards <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> encountered on the banks of the Euphrates, the kingdom of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> (82) was alternately oppressed by its formidable protectors; and in the course of this History, several events which inclined the balance of peace and war, have been already related.
 A disgraceful treaty had resigned <GPE>Armenia</GPE> to the ambition of Sapor; and the scale of <GPE>Persia</GPE> appeared to preponderate.
 But the royal race of <PERSON>Arsaces</PERSON> impatiently submitted to the house of Sassan; the turbulent nobles asserted, or betrayed, their hereditary independence; and the nation was still attached to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes of Constantinople.
 In the beginning of the fifth century <GPE>Armenia</GPE> was divided by the progress of war and faction; (83) and the unnatural division precipitated the downfall of that ancient monarchy.
 Chosroes, the <NORP>Persian</NORP> vassal, reigned over the eastern and most extensive portion of the country; while the western province acknowledged the jurisdiction of Arsaces, and the supremacy of the emperor Arcadius.
 After the death of Arsaces, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> suppressed the regal government, and imposed on their allies the condition of subjects.
 The military command was delegated to the count of the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> frontier; the city of <GPE>Theodosiopolis</GPE> (84) was built and fortified in a strong situation, on a fertile and lofty ground, near the sources of the Euphrates; and the dependent territories were ruled by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> satraps, whose dignity was marked by a peculiar habit of gold and purple.
 The less fortunate nobles, who lamented the loss of their king, and envied the honours of their equals, were provoked to negotiate their peace and pardon at the <NORP>Persian</NORP> court; and, returning with their followers to the palace of Artaxata, acknowledged <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> for their lawful sovereign.
 About thirty years afterwards, Artasires, the nephew and successor of Chosroes, fell under the displeasure of the haughty and capricious nobles of Armenia; and they unanimously desired a <NORP>Persian</NORP> governor in the room of an unworthy king.
 The answer of the archbishop Isaac, whose sanction they earnestly solicited, is expressive of the character of a superstitious people.
 He deplored the manifest and inexcusable vices of Artasires; and declared that he should not hesitate to accuse him before the tribunal of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperor, who would punish, without destroying, the sinner Exasperated by the firmness of Isaac, the factious nobles accused both the king and the archbishop as the secret adherents of the emperor; and absurdly rejoiced in the sentence of condemnation, which, after a partial hearing, was solemnly pronounced by <PERSON>Bahram</PERSON> himself.
 The descendants of <PERSON>Arsaces</PERSON> were degraded from the royal dignity, (86) which they had possessed above <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty years; (87) and the dominions of the unfortunate Artasires, under the new and significant appellation of Persarmenia, were reduced into the form of a province.
 This usurpation excited the jealousy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; but the rising disputes were soon terminated by an amicable, though unequal, partition of the ancient kingdom of Armenia; and a territorial acquisition, which <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> might have despised, reflected some lustre on the declining empire of the younger Theodosius.
