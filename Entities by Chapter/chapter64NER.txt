 Danger of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> Empire.
From the petty quarrels of a city and her suburbs, from the cowardice and discord of the falling Greeks, I shall now ascend to the victorious Turks; whose domestic slavery was ennobled by martial discipline, religious enthusiasm, and the energy of the national character.
 The rise and progress of the Ottomans, the present sovereigns of Constantinople, are connected with the most important scenes of modern history; but they are founded on a previous knowledge of the great eruption of the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> and Tartars; whose rapid conquests may be compared with the primitive convulsions of nature, which have agitated and altered the surface of the globe.
 I have long since asserted my claim to introduce the nations, the immediate or remote authors of the fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire; nor can I refuse myself to those events, which, from their uncommon magnitude, will interest a philosophic mind in the history of blood.
 (1) <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> Khan, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emperor of the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> and Tartars, A.
D.
 1206-1227.
 From the spacious highlands between China, Siberia, and the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> Sea, the tide of emigration and war has repeatedly been poured.
 These ancient seats of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> and <NORP>Turks</NORP> were occupied in the twelfth century by many pastoral tribes, of the same descent and similar manners, which were united and led to conquest by the formidable Zingis.
 In his ascent to greatness, that <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> (whose private appellation was Temugin) had trampled on the necks of his equals.
 His birth was noble; but it was the pride of victory, that the prince or people deduced his <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> ancestor from the immaculate conception of a virgin.
 His father had reigned over <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> hordes, which composed about <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> or forty thousand families: above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thirds refused to pay tithes or obedience to his infant son; and at the age of thirteen, <PERSON>Temugin</PERSON> fought a battle against his rebellious subjects.
 The future conqueror of <LOC>Asia</LOC> was reduced to fly and to obey; but he rose superior to his fortune, and in his fortieth <DATE>year</DATE> he had established his fame and dominion over the circumjacent tribes.
 In a state of society, in which policy is rude and valour is universal, the ascendant of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> man must be founded on his power and resolution to punish his enemies and recompense his friends.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> military league was ratified by the simple rites of sacrificing a horse and tasting of a running stream: <PERSON>Temugin</PERSON> pledged himself to divide with his followers the sweets and the bitters of life; and when he had shared among them his horses and apparel, he was rich in their gratitude and his own hopes.
 After his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> victory, he placed <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> cauldrons on the fire, and <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> of the most guilty rebels were cast headlong into the boiling water.
 The sphere of his attraction was continually enlarged by the ruin of the proud and the submission of the prudent; and the boldest chieftains might tremble, when they beheld, enchased in silver, the skull of the khan of Keraites; (2) who, under the name of Prester John, had corresponded with the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff and the princes of Europe.
 The ambition of <PERSON>Temugin</PERSON> condescended to employ the arts of superstition; and it was from a naked prophet, who could ascend to heaven on a white horse, that he accepted the title of Zingis, (3) the most great; and a divine right to the conquest and dominion of the earth.
 In a general couroultai, or diet, he was seated on a felt, which was long afterwards revered as a relic, and solemnly proclaimed great khan, or emperor of the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> (4) and Tartars.
 (5) Of these kindred, though rival, names, the former had given birth to the imperial race; and the latter has been extended by accident or error over the spacious wilderness of the north.
 His laws.
 The code of laws which <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> dictated to his subjects was adapted to the preservation of a domestic peace, and the exercise of foreign hostility.
 The punishment of death was inflicted on the crimes of adultery, murder, perjury, and the capital thefts of a horse or ox; and the fiercest of men were mild and just in their intercourse with each other.
 The future election of the great khan was vested in the princes of his family and the heads of the tribes; and the regulations of the chase were essential to the pleasures and plenty of a <NORP>Tartar</NORP> camp.
 The victorious nation was held sacred from all servile labours, which were abandoned to slaves and strangers; and every labor was servile except the profession of arms.
 The service and discipline of the troops, who were armed with bows, cimeters, and iron maces, and divided by hundreds, thousands, and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousands, were the institutions of a veteran commander.
 Each officer and soldier was made responsible, under pain of death, for the safety and honour of his companions; and the spirit of conquest breathed in the law, that peace should never be granted unless to a vanquished and suppliant enemy.
 But it is the religion of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> that best deserves our wonder and applause.
 The <NORP>Catholic</NORP> inquisitors of Europe, who defended nonsense by cruelty, might have been confounded by the example of a Barbarian, who anticipated the lessons of philosophy, (6) and established by his laws a system of pure theism and perfect toleration.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and only article of faith was the existence of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> God, the Author of all good; who fills by his presence the heavens and earth, which he has created by his power.
 The <NORP>Tartars</NORP> and <NORP>Moguls</NORP> were addicted to the idols of their peculiar tribes; and many of them had been converted by the foreign missionaries to the religions of Moses, of Mahomet, and of Christ.
 These various systems in freedom and concord were taught and practised within the precincts of the same camp; and the Bonze, the Imam, the Rabbi, the Nestorian, and the <NORP>Latin</NORP> priest, enjoyed the same honourable exemption from service and tribute: in the mosque of Bochara, the insolent victor might trample the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> under his horse's feet, but the calm legislator respected the prophets and pontiffs of the most hostile sects.
 The reason of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> was not informed by books: the khan could neither read nor write; and, except the tribe of the Igours, the greatest part of the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> and <NORP>Tartars</NORP> were as illiterate as their sovereign.
 The memory of their exploits was preserved by tradition: sixty- eight <DATE>years</DATE> after the death of Zingis, these traditions were collected and transcribed; (7) the brevity of their domestic annals may be supplied by the Chinese, (8) Persians, (9) Armenians, (10) Syrians, (11) Arabians, (12) Greeks, (13) Russians, (14) Poles, (15) Hungarians, (16) and Latins; (17) and each nation will deserve credit in the relation of their own disasters and defeats.
 (18) His invasion of China, A.
D.
 1210-1214.
 The arms of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> and his lieutenants successively reduced the hordes of the desert, who pitched their tents between the wall of <GPE>China</GPE> and the Volga; and the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> emperor became the monarch of the pastoral world, the lord of many <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of shepherds and soldiers, who felt their united strength, and were impatient to rush on the mild and wealthy climates of the south.
 His ancestors had been the tributaries of the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> emperors; and <PERSON>Temugin</PERSON> himself had been disgraced by a title of honour and servitude.
 The court of <GPE>Pekin</GPE> was astonished by an embassy from its former vassal, who, in the tone of the king of nations, exacted the tribute and obedience which he had paid, and who affected to treat the son of heaven as the most contemptible of mankind.
 A haughty answer disguised their secret apprehensions; and their fears were soon justified by the march of innumerable squadrons, who pierced on all sides the feeble rampart of the great wall.
 <CARDINAL>Ninety</CARDINAL> cities were stormed, or starved, by the Moguls; <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> only escaped; and Zingis, from a knowledge of the filial piety of the Chinese, covered his vanguard with their captive parents; an unworthy, and by degrees a fruitless, abuse of the virtue of his enemies.
 His invasion was supported by the revolt of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand Khitans, who guarded the frontier: yet he listened to a treaty; and a princess of China, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand horses, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> youths, and as many virgins, and a tribute of gold and silk, were the price of his retreat.
 In his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> expedition, he compelled the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> emperor to retire beyond the yellow river to a more southern residence.
 The siege of <GPE>Pekin</GPE> (19) was long and laborious: the inhabitants were reduced by famine to decimate and devour their fellow-citizens; when their ammunition was spent, they discharged ingots of gold and silver from their engines; but the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> introduced a mine to the centre of the capital; and the conflagration of the palace burnt above <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> days.
 <GPE>China</GPE> was desolated by <NORP>Tartar</NORP> war and domestic faction; and the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> northern provinces were added to the empire of Zingis.
 of Carizme, Transoxiana, and Persia, A.
D.
 1218-1224.
 In the West, he touched the dominions of Mohammed, sultan of Carizime, who reigned from the <NORP>Persian</NORP> Gulf to the borders of <GPE>India</GPE> and Turkestan; and who, in the proud imitation of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Great, forgot the servitude and ingratitude of his fathers to the house of Seljuk.
 It was the wish of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> to establish a friendly and commercial intercourse with the most powerful of the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> princes: nor could he be tempted by the secret solicitations of the caliph of Bagdad, who sacrificed to his personal wrongs the safety of the church and state.
 A rash and inhuman deed provoked and justified the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> arms in the invasion of the southern Asia.
 A caravan of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ambassadors and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> merchants were arrested and murdered at Otrar, by the command of Mohammed; nor was it till after a demand and denial of justice, till he had prayed and fasted <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> nights on a mountain, that the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> emperor appealed to the judgment of God and his sword.
 Our <NORP>European</NORP> battles, says a philosophic writer, (20) are petty skirmishes, if compared to the numbers that have fought and fallen in the fields of Asia.
 Seven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Moguls</NORP> and <NORP>Tartars</NORP> are said to have marched under the standard of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> and his <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> sons.
 In the vast plains that extend to the north of the <LOC>Sihon</LOC> or Jaxartes, they were encountered by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand soldiers of the sultan; and in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> battle, which was suspended by the night, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty thousand <NORP>Carizmians</NORP> were slain.
 <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> was astonished by the multitude and valour of his enemies: he withdrew from the scene of danger, and distributed his troops in the frontier towns; trusting that the Barbarians, invincible in the field, would be repulsed by the length and difficulty of so many regular sieges.
 But the prudence of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> had formed a body of <NORP>Chinese</NORP> engineers, skilled in the mechanic arts; informed perhaps of the secret of gunpowder, and capable, under his discipline, of attacking a foreign country with more vigour and success than they had defended their own.
 The <NORP>Persian</NORP> historians will relate the sieges and reduction of Otrar, Cogende, Bochara, Samarcand, Carizme, Herat, Merou, Nisabour, Balch, and Candahar; and the conquest of the rich and populous countries of Transoxiana, Carizme, and Chorazan.
 The destructive hostilities of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> and the <NORP>Huns</NORP> have long since been elucidated by the example of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> and the Moguls; and in this more proper place I shall be content to observe, that, from the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> to the Indus, they ruined a tract of many <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles, which was adorned with the habitations and labours of mankind, and that <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> centuries have not been sufficient to repair the ravages of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years.
 The <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> emperor encouraged or indulged the fury of his troops: the hope of future possession was lost in the ardour of rapine and slaughter; and the cause of the war exasperated their native fierceness by the pretence of justice and revenge.
 The downfall and death of the sultan Mohammed, who expired, unpitied and alone, in a desert island of the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> Sea, is a poor atonement for the calamities of which he was the author.
 Could the <NORP>Carizmian</NORP> empire have been saved by a single hero, it would have been saved by his son Gelaleddin, whose active valour repeatedly checked the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> in the career of victory.
 Retreating, as he fought, to the banks of the Indus, he was oppressed by their innumerable host, till, in the last moment of despair, <PERSON>Gelaleddin</PERSON> spurred his horse into the waves, swam <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the broadest and most rapid rivers of Asia, and extorted the admiration and applause of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> himself.
 It was in this camp that the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> conqueror yielded with reluctance to the murmurs of his weary and wealthy troops, who sighed for the enjoyment of their native land.
 Eucumbered with the spoils of Asia, he slowly measured back his footsteps, betrayed some pity for the misery of the vanquished, and declared his intention of rebuilding the cities which had been swept away by the tempest of his arms.
 After he had repassed the <FAC>Oxus</FAC> and Jaxartes, he was joined by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals, whom he had detached with <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand horse, to subdue the western provinces of Persia.
 They had trampled on the nations which opposed their passage, penetrated through the gates of Derbent, traversed the <LOC>Volga</LOC> and the desert, and accomplished the circuit of the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> Sea, by an expedition which had never been attempted, and has never been repeated.
 His death, A.
D.
 1227.
 The return of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> was signalized by the overthrow of the rebellious or independent kingdoms of Tartary; and he died in the fulness of <DATE>years</DATE> and glory, with his last breath exhorting and instructing his sons to achieve the conquest of the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> empire.
 Conquests of the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> under the successors of Zingis, A.
D.
 1227-1295.
 The harem of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> was composed of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> wives and concubines; and of his numerous progeny, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> sons, illustrious by their birth and merit, exercised under their father the principal offices of peace and war.
 <PERSON>Toushi</PERSON> was his great huntsman, <GPE>Zagatai</GPE> (21) his judge, <PERSON>Octai</PERSON> his minister, and <PERSON>Tuli</PERSON> his general; and their names and actions are often conspicuous in the history of his conquests.
 Firmly united for their own and the public interest, the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> brothers and their families were content with dependent sceptres; and Octai, by general consent, was proclaimed great khan, or emperor of the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> and Tartars.
 He was succeeded by his son Gayuk, after whose death the empire devolved to his cousins <GPE>Mangou</GPE> and Cublai, the sons of Tuli, and the grandsons of Zingis.
 In the sixty-eight <DATE>years</DATE> of his <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> successors, the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> subdued almost all Asia, and a large portion of Europe.
 Without confining myself to the order of time, without expatiating on the detail of events, I shall present a general picture of the progress of their arms; I.
 In the East; II.
 In the South; III.
 In the West; and IV.
 In the North.
 Of the northern empire of China, A.
D.
 1234.
 I.
 Before the invasion of Zingis, <GPE>China</GPE> was divided into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires or dynasties of the <LOC>North</LOC> and South; (22) and the difference of origin and interest was smoothed by a general conformity of laws, language, and national manners.
 The <NORP>Northern</NORP> empire, which had been dismembered by Zingis, was finally subdued <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> after his death.
 After the loss of Pekin, the emperor had fixed his residence at Kaifong, a city many leagues in circumference, and which contained, according to the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> annals, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand families of inhabitants and fugitives.
 He escaped from thence with only <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> horsemen, and made his last stand in a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> capital, till at length the hopeless monarch, protesting his innocence and accusing his fortune, ascended a funeral pile, and gave orders, that, as soon as he had stabbed himself, the fire should be kindled by his attendants.
 The dynasty of the Song, the native and ancient sovereigns of the whole empire, survived about forty-five <DATE>years</DATE> the fall of the <NORP>Northern</NORP> usurpers; and the perfect conquest was reserved for the arms of Cublai.
 During this interval, the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> were often diverted by foreign wars; and, if the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> seldom dared to meet their victors in the field, their passive courage presented and endless succession of cities to storm and of <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> to slaughter.
 In the attack and defence of places, the engines of antiquity and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire were alternately employed: the use of gunpowder in cannon and bombs appears as a familiar practice; (23) and the sieges were conducted by the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> and Franks, who had been liberally invited into the service of Cublai.
 After passing the great river, the troops and artillery were conveyed along a series of canals, till they invested the royal residence of Hamcheu, or Quinsay, in the country of silk, the most delicious climate of China.
 The emperor, a defenceless youth, surrendered his person and sceptre; and before he was sent in exile into Tartary, he struck <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> times the ground with his forehead, to adore in prayer or thanksgiving the mercy of the great khan.
 Of the southern, A.
D.
 1279.
 Yet the war (it was now styled a rebellion) was still maintained in the southern provinces from <GPE>Hamcheu</GPE> to Canton; and the obstinate remnant of independence and hostility was transported from the land to the sea.
 But when the fleet of the <PERSON>Song</PERSON> was surrounded and oppressed by a superior armament, their last champion leaped into the waves with his infant emperor in his arms.
 A <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Chinese</NORP> imitated his example; and the whole empire, from <GPE>Tonkin</GPE> to the great wall, submitted to the dominion of Cublai.
 His boundless ambition aspired to the conquest of Japan: his fleet was twice shipwrecked; and the lives of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Moguls</NORP> and <NORP>Chinese</NORP> were sacrificed in the fruitless expedition.
 But the circumjacent kingdoms, Corea, Tonkin, Cochinchina, Pegu, Bengal, and Thibet, were reduced in different degrees of tribute and obedience by the effort or terror of his arms.
 He explored the <NORP>Indian</NORP> Ocean with a fleet of a thousand ships: they sailed in sixty-eight days, most probably to the Isle of Borneo, under the equinoctial line; and though they returned not without spoil or glory, the emperor was dissatisfied that the savage king had escaped from their hands.
 Of <GPE>Persia</GPE> and the empire of the Caliphs, A.
D.
 1258.
 II.
 The conquest of <GPE>Hindostan</GPE> by the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> was reserved in a later period for the house of Timour; but that of Iran, or Persia, was achieved by <PERSON>Holagou</PERSON> Khan, the grandson of Zingis, the brother and lieutenant of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> successive emperors, <GPE>Mangou</GPE> and Cublai.
 I shall not enumerate the crowd of sultans, emirs, and atabeks, whom he trampled into dust; but the extirpation of the Assassins, or <NORP>Ismaelians</NORP> (24) of Persia, may be considered as a service to mankind.
 Among the hills to the south of the Caspian, these odious sectaries had reigned with impunity above a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty years; and their prince, or Imam, established his lieutenant to lead and govern the colony of Mount Libanus, so famous and formidable in the history of the crusades.
 (25) With the fanaticism of the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> the <NORP>Ismaelians</NORP> had blended the <NORP>Indian</NORP> transmigration, and the visions of their own prophets; and it was their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> duty to devote their souls and bodies in blind obedience to the vicar of God.
 The daggers of his missionaries were felt both in the <LOC>East</LOC> and West: the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> enumerate, and persons multiply, the illustrious victims that were sacrificed to the zeal, avarice, or resentment of the old man (as he was corruptly styled) of the mountain.
 But these daggers, his only arms, were broken by the sword of Holagou, and not a vestige is left of the enemies of mankind, except the word assassin, which, in the most odious sense, has been adopted in the languages of Europe.
 The extinction of the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> cannot be indifferent to the spectators of their greatness and decline.
 Since the fall of their <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> tyrants the caliphs had recovered their lawful dominion of <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> and the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> Irak; but the city was distracted by theological factions, and the commander of the faithful was lost in a harem of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> concubines.
 The invasion of the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> he encountered with feeble arms and haughty embassies.
 This presumption was cherished by a perfidious vizier, who assured his master, that, even if the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> had entered the city, the women and children, from the terraces, would be sufficient to overwhelm them with stones.
 But when <PERSON>Holagou</PERSON> touched the phantom, it instantly vanished into smoke.
 After a siege of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months, <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> was stormed and sacked by the Moguls; and their savage commander pronounced the death of the caliph Mostasem, the last of the temporal successors of Mahomet; whose noble kinsmen, of the race of Abbas, had reigned in <LOC>Asia</LOC> above <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years.
 Whatever might be the designs of the conqueror, the holy cities of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> and <GPE>Medina</GPE> (26) were protected by the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> desert; but the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> spread beyond the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> and Euphrates, pillaged <GPE>Aleppo</GPE> and Damascus, and threatened to join the <NORP>Franks</NORP> in the deliverance of Jerusalem.
 <GPE>Egypt</GPE> was lost, had she been defended only by her feeble offspring; but the <NORP>Mamalukes</NORP> had breathed in their infancy the keenness of a <NORP>Scythian</NORP> air: equal in valour, superior in discipline, they met the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> in many a well-fought field; and drove back the stream of hostility to the eastward of the Euphrates.
 Of Anatolia, A.
D.
 1242-1272.
 But it overflowed with resistless violence the kingdoms of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and Anatolia, of which the former was possessed by the Christians, and the latter by the Turks.
 The sultans of <NORP>Iconium</NORP> opposed some resistance to the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> arms, till <PERSON>Azzadin</PERSON> sought a refuge among the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> of Constantinople, and his feeble successors, the last of the <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> dynasty, were finally extirpated by the khans of Persia.
 Of Kipzak, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Etc, A.
D.
 1235-1245.
 III.
 No sooner had <PERSON>Octai</PERSON> subverted the northern empire of China, than he resolved to visit with his arms the most remote countries of the West.
 Fifteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Moguls</NORP> and <NORP>Tartars</NORP> were inscribed on the military roll: of these the great khan selected a third, which he intrusted to the command of his nephew Batou, the son of Tuli; who reigned over his father's conquests to the north of the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> Sea.
 After a festival of forty days, <PERSON>Batou</PERSON> set forwards on this great expedition; and such was the speed and ardour of his innumerable squadrons, than in less than <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> they had measured a line of ninety degrees of longitude, a <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> part of the circumference of the globe.
 The great rivers of <LOC>Asia</LOC> and Europe, the <LOC>Volga</LOC> and Kama, the <FAC>Don</FAC> and Borysthenes, the <FAC>Vistula</FAC> and Danube, they either swam with their horses or passed on the ice, or traversed in leathern boats, which followed the camp, and transported their wagons and artillery.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> victories of Batou, the remains of national freedom were eradicated in the immense plains of <GPE>Turkestan</GPE> and Kipzak.
 (27) In his rapid progress, he overran the kingdoms, as they are now styled, of <NORP>Astracan</NORP> and Cazan; and the troops which he detached towards Mount Caucasus explored the most secret recesses of <GPE>Georgia</GPE> and Circassia.
 The civil discord of the great dukes, or princes, of Russia, betrayed their country to the Tartars.
 They spread from <GPE>Livonia</GPE> to the Black Sea, and both <GPE>Moscow</GPE> and Kiow, the modern and the ancient capitals, were reduced to ashes; a temporary ruin, less fatal than the deep, and perhaps indelible, mark, which a servitude of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> has imprinted on the character of the Russians.
 The <NORP>Tartars</NORP> ravaged with equal fury the countries which they hoped to possess, and those which they were hastening to leave.
 From the permanent conquest of <GPE>Russia</GPE> they made a deadly, though transient, inroad into the heart of Poland, and as far as the borders of Germany.
 The cities of <GPE>Lublin</GPE> and <GPE>Cracow</GPE> were obliterated: they approached the shores of the Baltic; and in the battle of <GPE>Lignitz</GPE> they defeated the dukes of Silesia, the <NORP>Polish</NORP> palatines, and the great master of the <NORP>Teutonic</NORP> order, and filled <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> sacks with the right ears of the slain.
 From Lignitz, the extreme point of their western march, they turned aside to the invasion of Hungary; and the presence or spirit of <PERSON>Batou</PERSON> inspired the host of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand men: the <NORP>Carpathian</NORP> hills could not be long impervious to their divided columns; and their approach had been fondly disbelieved till it was irresistibly felt.
 The king, <PERSON>Bela</PERSON> the Fourth, assembled the military force of his counts and bishops; but he had alienated the nation by adopting a vagrant horde of forty thousand families of Comans, and these savage guests were provoked to revolt by the suspicion of treachery and the murder of their prince.
 The whole country north of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> was lost in a day, and depopulated in a summer; and the ruins of cities and churches were overspread with the bones of the natives, who expiated the sins of their <NORP>Turkish</NORP> ancestors.
 An ecclesiastic, who fled from the sack of Waradin, describes the calamities which he had seen, or suffered; and the sanguinary rage of sieges and battles is far less atrocious than the treatment of the fugitives, who had been allured from the woods under a promise of peace and pardon and who were coolly slaughtered as soon as they had performed the labours of the harvest and vintage.
 In the <DATE>winter</DATE> the <NORP>Tartars</NORP> passed the <LOC>Danube</LOC> on the ice, and advanced to Gran or Strigonium, a <NORP>German</NORP> colony, and the metropolis of the kingdom.
 <CARDINAL>Thirty</CARDINAL> engines were planted against the walls; the ditches were filled with sacks of earth and dead bodies; and after a promiscuous massacre, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> noble matrons were slain in the presence of the khan.
 Of all the cities and fortresses of Hungary, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> alone survived the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> invasion, and the unfortunate <PERSON>Bata</PERSON> hid his head among the islands of the Adriatic.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> world was darkened by this cloud of savage hostility: a <NORP>Russian</NORP> fugitive carried the alarm to Sweden; and the remote nations of the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> and the ocean trembled at the approach of the Tartars, (28) whom their fear and ignorance were inclined to separate from the human species.
 Since the invasion of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> in the eighth century, <LOC>Europe</LOC> had never been exposed to a similar calamity: and if the disciples of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> would have oppressed her religion and liberty, it might be apprehended that the shepherds of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> would extinguish her cities, her arts, and all the institutions of civil society.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff attempted to appease and convert these invincible <NORP>Pagans</NORP> by a mission of <NORP>Franciscan</NORP> and <NORP>Dominican</NORP> friars; but he was astonished by the reply of the khan, that the sons of God and of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> were invested with a divine power to subdue or extirpate the nations; and that the pope would be involved in the universal destruction, unless he visited in person, and as a suppliant, the royal horde.
 The emperor <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> embraced a more generous mode of defence; and his letters to the kings of <GPE>France</GPE> and England, and the princes of Germany, represented the common danger, and urged them to arm their vassals in this just and rational crusade.
 (29) The <NORP>Tartars</NORP> themselves were awed by the fame and valour of the Franks; the town of <GPE>Newstadt</GPE> in <GPE>Austria</GPE> was bravely defended against them by <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> knights and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> crossbows; and they raised the siege on the appearance of a <NORP>German</NORP> army.
 After wasting the adjacent kingdoms of Servia, Bosnia, and Bulgaria, <PERSON>Batou</PERSON> slowly retreated from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the <LOC>Volga</LOC> to enjoyed the rewards of victory in the city and palace of Serai, which started at his command from the midst of the desert.

 The spirit of enterprise which pursued the course of the <PRODUCT>Oby</PRODUCT> and <GPE>Yenisei</GPE> must have led to the discovery of the icy sea.
 After brushing away the monstrous fables, of men with dogs heads and cloven feet, we shall find, that, fifteen <DATE>years</DATE> after the death of Zingis, the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> were informed of the name and manners of the <NORP>Samoyedes</NORP> in the neighbourhood of the polar circle, who dwelt in subterraneous huts, and derived their firs and their food from the sole occupation of hunting.
 (30) The successors of Zingis, A.
D.
 1227-1259.
 While China, Syria, and Poland, were invaded at the same time by the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> and Tartars, the authors of the mighty mischief were content with the knowledge and declaration, that their word was the sword of death.
 Like the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> caliphs, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> successors of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> seldom appeared in person at the head of their victorious armies.
 On the banks of the <LOC>Onon</LOC> and Selinga, the royal or golden horde exhibited the contrast of simplicity and greatness; of the roasted sheep and mare's milk which composed their banquets; and of a distribution in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> wagons of gold and silver.
 The ambassadors and princes of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> were compelled to undertake this distant and laborious pilgrimage; and the life and reign of the great dukes of Russia, the kings of <GPE>Georgia</GPE> and Armenia, the sultans of Iconium, and the emirs of Persia, were decided by the frown or smile of the great khan.
 adopt the manners of China, A.
D.
 1259-1368.
 The sons and grandsons of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> had been accustomed to the pastoral life; but the village of <PERSON>Caracorum</PERSON> (31) was gradually ennobled by their election and residence.
 A change of manners is implied in the removal of <PERSON>Octai</PERSON> and <GPE>Mangou</GPE> from a tent to a house; and their example was imitated by the princes of their family and the great officers of the empire.
 Instead of the boundless forest, the enclosure of a park afforded the more indolent pleasures of the chase; their new habitations were decorated with painting and sculpture; their superfluous treasures were cast in fountains, and basins, and statues of massy silver; and the artists of <GPE>China</GPE> and <GPE>Paris</GPE> vied with each other in the service of the great khan.
 (32) <PERSON>Caracorum</PERSON> contained <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> streets, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of <NORP>Chinese</NORP> mechanics, the other of <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> traders; and the places of religious worship, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> church, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> mosques, and <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> temples of various idols, may represent in some degree the number and division of inhabitants.
 Yet a <NORP>French</NORP> missionary declares, that the town of St.
 Denys, near Paris, was more considerable than the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> capital; and that the whole palace of <GPE>Mangou</GPE> was scarcely equal to a <ORDINAL>tenth</ORDINAL> part of that <NORP>Benedictine</NORP> abbey.
 The conquests of <GPE>Russia</GPE> and <GPE>Syria</GPE> might amuse the vanity of the great khans; but they were seated on the borders of China; the acquisition of that empire was the nearest and most interesting object; and they might learn from their pastoral economy, that it is for the advantage of the shepherd to protect and propagate his flock.
 I have already celebrated the wisdom and virtue of a <LANGUAGE>Mandarin</LANGUAGE> who prevented the desolation of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous and cultivated provinces.
 In a spotless administration of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, this friend of his country and of mankind continually labored to mitigate, or suspend, the havoc of war; to save the monuments, and to rekindle the flame, of science; to restrain the military commander by the restoration of civil magistrates; and to instil the love of peace and justice into the minds of the Moguls.
 He struggled with the barbarism of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conquerors; but his salutary lessons produced a rich harvest in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> generation.
 The northern, and by degrees the southern, empire acquiesced in the government of Cublai, the lieutenant, and afterwards the successor, of Mangou; and the nation was loyal to a prince who had been educated in the manners of China.
 He restored the forms of her venerable constitution; and the victors submitted to the laws, the fashions, and even the prejudices, of the vanquished people.
 This peaceful triumph, which has been more than once repeated, may be ascribed, in a great measure, to the numbers and servitude of the Chinese.
 The <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> army was dissolved in a vast and populous country; and their emperors adopted with pleasure a political system, which gives to the prince the solid substance of despotism, and leaves to the subject the empty names of philosophy, freedom, and filial obedience.
 Under the reign of Cublai, letters and commerce, peace and justice, were restored; the great canal, of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles, was opened from <GPE>Nankin</GPE> to the capital: he fixed his residence at Pekin; and displayed in his court the magnificence of the greatest monarch of Asia.
 Yet this learned prince declined from the pure and simple religion of his great ancestor: he sacrificed to the idol Fo; and his blind attachment to the lamas of <NORP>Thibet</NORP> and the bonzes of <GPE>China</GPE> (33) provoked the censure of the disciples of Confucius.
 His successors polluted the palace with a crowd of eunuchs, physicians, and astrologers, while <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of their subjects were consumed in the provinces by famine.
 Division of the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> empire, A.
D.
 1259-1300.
 One <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and forty <DATE>years</DATE> after the death of Zingis, his degenerate race, the dynasty of the Yuen, was expelled by a revolt of the native Chinese; and the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> emperors were lost in the oblivion of the desert.
 Before this revolution, they had forfeited their supremacy over the dependent branches of their house, the khans of <PERSON>Kipzak</PERSON> and Russia, the khans of Zagatai, or Transoxiana, and the khans of <GPE>Iran</GPE> or Persia.
 By their distance and power, these royal lieutenants had soon been released from the duties of obedience; and after the death of Cublai, they scorned to accept a sceptre or a title from his unworthy successors.
 According to their respective situations, they maintained the simplicity of the pastoral life, or assumed the luxury of the cities of Asia; but the princes and their hordes were alike disposed for the reception of a foreign worship.
 After some hesitation between the <WORK_OF_ART>Gospel</WORK_OF_ART> and the Koran, they conformed to the religion of Mahomet; and while they adopted for their brethren the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> and Persians, they renounced all intercourse with the ancient Moguls, the idolaters of China.
 Escape of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire from the Moguls, A.
D.
 1240-1304.
 In this shipwreck of nations, some surprise may be excited by the escape of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, whose relics, at the time of the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> invasion, were dismembered by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins.
 Less potent than Alexander, they were pressed, like the Macedonian, both in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, by the shepherds of Scythia; and had the <NORP>Tartars</NORP> undertaken the siege, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> must have yielded to the fate of Pekin, Samarcand, and Bagdad.
 The glorious and voluntary retreat of <PERSON>Batou</PERSON> from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> was insulted by the vain triumph of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and Greeks; (34) and in a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> expedition death surprised him in full march to attack the capital of the Caesars.
 His brother <PERSON>Borga</PERSON> carried the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> arms into <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> and Thrace; but he was diverted from the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> war by a visit to Novogorod, in the <DATE>fifty-seventh</DATE> degree of latitude, where he numbered the inhabitants and regulated the tributes of Russia.
 The <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> khan formed an alliance with the <NORP>Mamalukes</NORP> against his brethren of Persia: <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand horse penetrated through the gates of Derbend; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> might rejoice in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> example of domestic war.
 After the recovery of Constantinople, Michael Palaeologus, (35) at a distance from his court and army, was surprised and surrounded in a <NORP>Thracian</NORP> castle, by <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand Tartars.
 But the object of their march was a private interest: they came to the deliverance of Azzadin, the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan; and were content with his person and the treasure of the emperor.
 Their general Noga, whose name is perpetuated in the hordes of Astracan, raised a formidable rebellion against Mengo Timour, the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the khans of Kipzak; obtained in marriage Maria, the natural daughter of Palaeologus; and guarded the dominions of his friend and father.
 The subsequent invasions of a <NORP>Scythian</NORP> cast were those of outlaws and fugitives: and some <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of <NORP>Alani</NORP> and Comans, who had been driven from their native seats, were reclaimed from a vagrant life, and enlisted in the service of the empire.
 Such was the influence in <LOC>Europe</LOC> of the invasion of the Moguls.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> terror of their arms secured, rather than disturbed, the peace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> Asia.
 The sultan of <NORP>Iconium</NORP> solicited a personal interview with <PERSON>John</PERSON> Vataces; and his artful policy encouraged the <NORP>Turks</NORP> to defend their barrier against the common enemy.
 (36) That barrier indeed was soon overthrown; and the servitude and ruin of the <NORP>Seljukians</NORP> exposed the nakedness of the Greeks.
 The formidable <PERSON>Holagou</PERSON> threatened to march to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> at the head of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand men; and the groundless panic of the citizens of <GPE>Nice</GPE> will present an image of the terror which he had inspired.
 The accident of a procession, and the sound of a doleful litany, "From the fury of the Tartars, good Lord, deliver us," had scattered the hasty report of an assault and massacre.
 In the blind credulity of fear, the streets of <GPE>Nice</GPE> were crowded with <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of both sexes, who knew not from what or to whom they fled; and some hours elapsed before the firmness of the military officers could relieve the city from this imaginary foe.
 But the ambition of <PERSON>Holagou</PERSON> and his successors was fortunately diverted by the conquest of Bagdad, and a long vicissitude of <NORP>Syrian</NORP> wars; their hostility to the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> inclined them to unite with the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks; (37) and their generosity or contempt had offered the kingdom of <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> as the reward of an <NORP>Armenian</NORP> vassal.

 but they all confessed the supremacy of the khans of Persia; and he often interposed his authority, and sometimes his arms, to check their depredations, and to preserve the peace and balance of his <NORP>Turkish</NORP> frontier.
 The death of Cazan, (38) <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the greatest and most accomplished princes of the house of Zingis, removed this salutary control; and the decline of the <NORP>Moguls</NORP> gave a free scope to the rise and progress of the OTTOMAN EMPIRE.
 (39) Origin of the Ottomans, A.
D.
 1240, etc.
 After the retreat of Zingis, the sultan <PERSON>Gelaleddin</PERSON> of <PERSON>Carizme</PERSON> had returned from <GPE>India</GPE> to the possession and defence of his <NORP>Persian</NORP> kingdoms.
 In the space of eleven years, that hero fought in person <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> battles; and such was his activity, that he led his cavalry in <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> days from <GPE>Teflia</GPE> to Kerman, a march of a thousand miles.
 Yet he was oppressed by the jealousy of the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> princes, and the innumerable armies of the Moguls; and after his last defeat, <PERSON>Gelaleddin</PERSON> perished ignobly in the mountains of Curdistan.
 His death dissolved a veteran and adventurous army, which included under the name of <NORP>Carizmians</NORP> or <NORP>Corasmins</NORP> many <NORP>Turkman</NORP> hordes, that had attached themselves to the sultan's fortune.
 The bolder and more powerful chiefs invaded Syria, and violated the holy sepulchre of Jerusalem: the more humble engaged in the service of Aladin, sultan of Iconium; and among these were the obscure fathers of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> line.
 They had formerly pitched their tents near the southern banks of the Oxus, in the plains of <LOC>Mahan</LOC> and Nesa; and it is somewhat remarkable, that the same spot should have produced the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> authors of the <NORP>Parthian</NORP> and <NORP>Turkish</NORP> empires.
 At the head, or in the rear, of a <NORP>Carizmian</NORP> army, <PERSON>Soliman</PERSON> Shah was drowned in the passage of the Euphrates: his son <PERSON>Orthogrul</PERSON> became the soldier and subject of Aladin, and established at Surgut, on the banks of the Sangar, a camp of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> families or tents, whom he governed fifty-two <DATE>years</DATE> both in peace and war.
 Reign of Othman, A.
D.
 1299-1326.
 He was the father of Thaman, or Athman, whose <NORP>Turkish</NORP> name has been melted into the appellation of the caliph Othman; and if we describe that pastoral chief as a shepherd and a robber, we must separate from those characters all idea of ignominy and baseness.
 <PERSON>Othman</PERSON> possessed, and perhaps surpassed, the ordinary virtues of a soldier; and the circumstances of time and place were propitious to his independence and success.
 The <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> dynasty was no more; and the distance and decline of the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> khans soon enfranchised him from the control of a superior.
 He was situate on the verge of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire: the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> sanctified his gazi, or holy war, against the infidels; and their political errors unlocked the passes of Mount Olympus, and invited him to descend into the plains of Bithynia.
 Till the reign of Palaeologus, these passes had been vigilantly guarded by the militia of the country, who were repaid by their own safety and an exemption from taxes.
 The emperor abolished their privilege and assumed their office; but the tribute was rigorously collected, the custody of the passes was neglected, and the hardy mountaineers degenerated into a trembling crowd of peasants without spirit or discipline.
 It was on the twenty-seventh of July, in the <DATE>year</DATE> <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and ninety-nine of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aera, that <PERSON>Othman</PERSON> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invaded the territory of Nicomedia; (40) and the singular accuracy of the date seems to disclose some foresight of the rapid and destructive growth of the monster.
 The annals of the twenty-seven <DATE>years</DATE> of his reign would exhibit a repetition of the same inroads; and his hereditary troops were multiplied in each campaign by the accession of captives and volunteers.
 Instead of retreating to the hills, he maintained the most useful and defensive posts; fortified the towns and castles which he had <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> pillaged; and renounced the pastoral life for the baths and palaces of his infant capitals.
 But it was not till <PERSON>Othman</PERSON> was oppressed by age and infirmities, that he received the welcome news of the conquest of Prusa, which had been surrendered by famine or treachery to the arms of his son Orchan.
 The glory of <PERSON>Othman</PERSON> is chiefly founded on that of his descendants; but the <NORP>Turks</NORP> have transcribed or composed a royal testament of his last counsels of justice and moderation.
 (41) Reign of Orchan, A.
D.
 1326-1360.
 From the conquest of Prusa, we may date the true aera of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> empire.
 The lives and possessions of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> subjects were redeemed by a tribute or ransom of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand crowns of gold; and the city, by the labours of Orchan, assumed the aspect of a <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> capital; <PERSON>Prusa</PERSON> was decorated with a mosque, a college, and a hospital, of royal foundation; the <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> coin was changed for the name and impression of the new dynasty: and the most skilful professors, of human and divine knowledge, attracted the <NORP>Persian</NORP> and <NORP>Arabian</NORP> students from the ancient schools of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> learning.
 The office of vizier was instituted for Aladin, the brother of Orchan; and a different habit distinguished the citizens from the peasants, the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> from the infidels.
 All the troops of <PERSON>Othman</PERSON> had consisted of loose squadrons of <NORP>Turkman</NORP> cavalry; who served without pay and fought without discipline: but a regular body of infantry was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> established and trained by the prudence of his son.
 A great number of volunteers was enrolled with a small stipend, but with the permission of living at home, unless they were summoned to the field: their rude manners, and seditious temper, disposed <PERSON>Orchan</PERSON> to educate his young captives as his soldiers and those of the prophet; but the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> peasants were still allowed to mount on horseback, and follow his standard, with the appellation and the hopes of freebooters.
 His conquest of Bithynia, A.
D.
 1326-1339.
 By these arts he formed an army of twenty-five thousand Moslems: a train of battering engines was framed for the use of sieges; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> successful experiment was made on the cities of <GPE>Nice</GPE> and Nicomedia.
 <PERSON>Orchan</PERSON> granted a safe-conduct to all who were desirous of departing with their families and effects; but the widows of the slain were given in marriage to the conquerors; and the sacrilegious plunder, the books, the vases, and the images, were sold or ransomed at Constantinople.
 The emperor <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> the Younger was vanquished and wounded by the son of Othman: (42) he subdued the whole province or kingdom of Bithynia, as far as the shores of the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> and Hellespont; and the <NORP>Christians</NORP> confessed the justice and clemency of a reign which claimed the voluntary attachment of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> of Asia.
 Division of <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> among the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> emirs, A.
D.
 1300, etc.
 Yet <PERSON>Orchan</PERSON> was content with the modest title of emir; and in the list of his compeers, the princes of <PERSON>Roum</PERSON> or Anatolia, (43) his military forces were surpassed by the emirs of <NORP>Ghermian</NORP> and Caramania, each of whom could bring into the field an army of forty thousand men.
 Their domains were situate in the heart of the <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> kingdom; but the holy warriors, though of inferior note, who formed new principalities on the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire, are more conspicuous in the light of history.
 The maritime country from the <LOC>Propontis</LOC> to the <LOC>Maeander</LOC> and the Isle of Rhodes, so long threatened and so often pillaged, was finally lost about the thirteenth <DATE>year</DATE> of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> the Elder.
 (44) <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Turkish</NORP> chieftains, <NORP>Sarukhan</NORP> and Aidin, left their names to their conquests, and their conquests to their posterity.
 Loss of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> provinces, A.
D.
 1312, etc.
 The captivity or ruin of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> churches of <LOC>Asia</LOC> was consummated; and the barbarous lords of <GPE>Ionia</GPE> and <GPE>Lydia</GPE> still trample on the monuments of classic and <NORP>Christian</NORP> antiquity.
 In the loss of Ephesus, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> deplored the fall of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> angel, the extinction of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> candlestick, of the Revelations; (45) the desolation is complete; and the temple of Diana, or the church of Mary, will equally elude the search of the curious traveller.
 The circus and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> stately theatres of <LOC>Laodicea</LOC> are now peopled with wolves and foxes; <PERSON>Sardes</PERSON> is reduced to a miserable village; the God of Mahomet, without a rival or a son, is invoked in the mosques of <NORP>Thyatira</NORP> and Pergamus; and the populousness of <GPE>Smyrna</GPE> is supported by the foreign trade of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and Armenians.
 <GPE>Philadelphia</GPE> alone has been saved by prophecy, or courage.
 At a distance from the sea, forgotten by the emperors, encompassed on all sides by the Turks, her valiant citizens defended their religion and freedom above fourscore years; and at length capitulated with the proudest of the Ottomans.
 Among the <NORP>Greek</NORP> colonies and churches of Asia, <GPE>Philadelphia</GPE> is still erect; a column in a scene of ruins; a pleasing example, that the paths of honour and safety may sometimes be the same.
 The knights of Rhodes, A.
D.
 1310, August <CARDINAL>15</CARDINAL> - 1523, January 1.
 The servitude of <PERSON>Rhodes</PERSON> was delayed about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> centuries by the establishment of the knights of St.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> of Jerusalem: (46) under the discipline of the order, that island emerged into fame and opulence; the noble and warlike monks were renowned by land and sea: and the bulwark of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> provoked, and repelled, the arms of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Saracens.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> passage of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> into Europe, A.
D.
 1341-1347.
 The Greeks, by their intestine divisions, were the authors of their final ruin.
 During the civil wars of the elder and younger Andronicus, the son of <PERSON>Othman</PERSON> achieved, almost without resistance, the conquest of Bithynia; and the same disorders encouraged the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> emirs of <GPE>Lydia</GPE> and <GPE>Ionia</GPE> to build a fleet, and to pillage the adjacent islands and the sea-coast of Europe.
 In the defence of his life and honour, <ORG>Cantacuzene</ORG> was tempted to prevent, or imitate, his adversaries, by calling to his aid the public enemies of his religion and country.
 Amir, the son of Aidin, concealed under a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> garb the humanity and politeness of a Greek; he was united with the great domestic by mutual esteem and reciprocal services; and their friendship is compared, in the vain rhetoric of the times, to the perfect union of <PERSON>Orestes</PERSON> and Pylades.
 (47) On the report of the danger of his friend, who was persecuted by an ungrateful court, the prince of <GPE>Ionia</GPE> assembled at <GPE>Smyrna</GPE> a fleet of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> vessels, with an army of twenty-nine thousand men; sailed in the depth of winter, and cast anchor at the mouth of the Hebrus.
 From thence, with a chosen band of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand Turks, he marched along the banks of the river, and rescued the empress, who was besieged in <LOC>Demotica</LOC> by the wild Bulgarians.
 At that disastrous moment, the life or death of his beloved <ORG>Cantacuzene</ORG> was concealed by his flight into Servia: but the grateful Irene, impatient to behold her deliverer, invited him to enter the city, and accompanied her message with a present of rich apparel and a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horses.
 By a peculiar strain of delicacy, the Gentle <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> refused, in the absence of an unfortunate friend, to visit his wife, or to taste the luxuries of the palace; sustained in his tent the rigour of the winter; and rejected the hospitable gift, that he might share the hardships of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand companions, all as deserving as himself of that honour and distinction.
 Necessity and revenge might justify his predatory excursions by sea and land: he left <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> men for the guard of his fleet; and persevered in the fruitless search of Cantacuzene, till his embarkation was hastened by a fictitious letter, the severity of the season, the clamours of his independent troops, and the weight of his spoil and captives.
 In the prosecution of the civil war, the prince of <GPE>Ionia</GPE> twice returned to Europe; joined his arms with those of the emperor; besieged Thessalonica, and threatened Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Calumny</PERSON> might affix some reproach on his imperfect aid, his hasty departure, and a bribe of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand crowns, which he accepted from the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court; but his friend was satisfied; and the conduct of <PERSON>Amir</PERSON> is excused by the more sacred duty of defending against the <NORP>Latins</NORP> his hereditary dominions.
 The maritime power of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> had united the pope, the king of Cyprus, the republic of Venice, and the order of St.
 John, in a laudable crusade; their galleys invaded the coast of Ionia; and <PERSON>Amir</PERSON> was slain with an arrow, in the attempt to wrest from the <NORP>Rhodian</NORP> knights the citadel of Smyrna.
 (48) Before his death, he generously recommended another ally of his own nation; not more sincere or zealous than himself, but more able to afford a prompt and powerful succour, by his situation along the <LOC>Propontis</LOC> and in the front of Constantinople.
 Marriage of <PERSON>Orchan</PERSON> with a <NORP>Greek</NORP> princess, A.
D.
 1346.
 By the prospect of a more advantageous treaty, the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> prince of <PERSON>Bithynia</PERSON> was detached from his engagements with <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> of Savoy; and the pride of <PERSON>Orchan</PERSON> dictated the most solemn protestations, that if he could obtain the daughter of Cantacuzene, he would invariably fulfil the duties of a subject and a son.
 Parental tenderness was silenced by the voice of ambition: the <NORP>Greek</NORP> clergy connived at the marriage of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> princess with a sectary of Mahomet; and the father of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> describes, with shameful satisfaction, the dishonour of the purple.
 (49) A body of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> cavalry attended the ambassadors, who disembarked from <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> vessels, before his camp of Selybria.
 A stately pavilion was erected, in which the empress <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> passed the night with her daughters.
 In the morning, <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> ascended a throne, which was surrounded with curtains of silk and gold: the troops were under arms; but the emperor alone was on horseback.
 At a signal the curtains were suddenly withdrawn to disclose the bride, or the victim, encircled by kneeling eunuchs and hymeneal torches: the sound of flutes and trumpets proclaimed the joyful event; and her pretended happiness was the theme of the nuptial song, which was chanted by such poets as the age could produce.
 Without the rites of the church, <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> was delivered to her barbarous lord: but it had been stipulated, that she should preserve her religion in the harem of Bursa; and her father celebrates her charity and devotion in this ambiguous situation.
 After his peaceful establishment on the throne of Constantinople, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor visited his <NORP>Turkish</NORP> ally, who with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> sons, by various wives, expected him at Scutari, on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes partook, with seeming cordiality, of the pleasures of the banquet and the chase; and <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> was permitted to repass the Bosphorus, and to enjoy some days in the society of her mother.
 But the friendship of <PERSON>Orchan</PERSON> was subservient to his religion and interest; and in the Genoese war he joined without a blush the enemies of Cantacuzene.
 Establishment of the <NORP>Ottomans</NORP> in Europe, A.
D.
 1353.
 In the treaty with the empress Anne, the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> prince had inserted a singular condition, that it should be lawful for him to sell his prisoners at Constantinople, or transport them into Asia.
 A naked crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> of both sexes and every age, of priests and monks, of matrons and virgins, was exposed in the public market; the whip was frequently used to quicken the charity of redemption; and the indigent <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplored the fate of their brethren, who were led away to the worst evils of temporal and spiritual bondage (50) <ORG>Cantacuzene</ORG> was reduced to subscribe the same terms; and their execution must have been still more pernicious to the empire: a body of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> had been detached to the assistance of the empress Anne; but the entire forces of <PERSON>Orchan</PERSON> were exerted in the service of his father.
 Yet these calamities were of a transient nature; as soon as the storm had passed away, the fugitives might return to their habitations; and at the conclusion of the civil and foreign wars, <LOC>Europe</LOC> was completely evacuated by the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> of Asia.
 It was in his last quarrel with his pupil that <ORG>Cantacuzene</ORG> inflicted the deep and deadly wound, which could never be healed by his successors, and which is poorly expiated by his theological dialogues against the prophet Mahomet.
 Ignorant of their own history, the modern <NORP>Turks</NORP> confound their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and their final passage of the Hellespont, (51) and describe the son of <PERSON>Orchan</PERSON> as a nocturnal robber, who, with <CARDINAL>eighty</CARDINAL> companions, explores by stratagem a hostile and unknown shore.
 Soliman, at the head of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand horse, was transported in the vessels, and entertained as the friend, of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 In the civil wars of Romania, he performed some service and perpetrated more mischief; but the <NORP>Chersonesus</NORP> was insensibly filled with a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> colony; and the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court solicited in vain the restitution of the fortresses of Thrace.
 After some artful delays between the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> prince and his son, their ransom was valued at sixty thousand crowns, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> payment had been made when an earthquake shook the walls and cities of the provinces; the dismantled places were occupied by the Turks; and Gallipoli, the key of the Hellespont, was rebuilt and repeopled by the policy of Soliman.
 The abdication of <ORG>Cantacuzene</ORG> dissolved the feeble bands of domestic alliance; and his last advice admonished his countrymen to decline a rash contest, and to compare their own weakness with the numbers and valour, the discipline and enthusiasm, of the Moslems.
 His prudent counsels were despised by the headstrong vanity of youth, and soon justified by the victories of the Ottomans.
 Death or <PERSON>Orchan</PERSON> and his son Soliman.
 But as he practised in the field the exercise of the jerid, <PERSON>Soliman</PERSON> was killed by a fall from his horse; and the aged <PERSON>Orchan</PERSON> wept and expired on the tomb of his valiant son.
 The reign and <NORP>European</NORP> conquests of <GPE>Amurath</GPE> I.
, A.
D.
 1360-1389, September.
 But the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> had not time to rejoice in the death of their enemies; and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> cimeter was wielded with the same spirit by <GPE>Amurath</GPE> the First, the son of Orchan, and the brother of Soliman.
 By the pale and fainting light of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> annals, (52) we can discern, that he subdued without resistance the whole province of <GPE>Romania</GPE> or Thrace, from the <PRODUCT>Hellespont</PRODUCT> to Mount Haemus, and the verge of the capital; and that <NORP>Adrianople</NORP> was chosen for the royal seat of his government and religion in Europe.
 Constantinople, whose decline is almost coeval with her foundation, had often, in the lapse of a thousand years, been assaulted by the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West; but never till this fatal hour had the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> been surrounded, both in <LOC>Asia</LOC> and Europe, by the arms of the same hostile monarchy.
 Yet the prudence or generosity of <GPE>Amurath</GPE> postponed for a while this easy conquest; and his pride was satisfied with the frequent and humble attendance of the emperor <PERSON>John</PERSON> <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> and his <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> sons, who followed at his summons the court and camp of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> prince.
 He marched against the <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> nations between the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the Adriatic, the Bulgarians, Servians, Bosnians, and Albanians; and these warlike tribes, who had so often insulted the majesty of the empire, were repeatedly broken by his destructive inroads.
 Their countries did not abound either in gold or silver; nor were their rustic hamlets and townships enriched by commerce or decorated by the arts of luxury.
 But the natives of the soil have been distinguished in every age by their hardiness of mind and body; and they were converted by a prudent institution into the firmest and most faithful supporters of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> greatness.
 (53) The <PERSON>Janizeries</PERSON> The vizier of <GPE>Amurath</GPE> reminded his sovereign that, according to the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> law, he was entitled to a <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> part of the spoil and captives; and that the duty might easily be levied, if vigilant officers were stationed in Gallipoli, to watch the passage, and to select for his use the stoutest and most beautiful of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> youth.
 The advice was followed: the edict was proclaimed; many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>European</NORP> captives were educated in religion and arms; and the new militia was consecrated and named by a celebrated dervish.
 Standing in the front of their ranks, he stretched the sleeve of his gown over the head of the foremost soldier, and his blessing was delivered in these words: Such was the origin of these haughty troops, the terror of the nations, and sometimes of the sultans themselves.
 Their valour has declined, their discipline is relaxed, and their tumultuary array is incapable of contending with the order and weapons of modern tactics; but at the time of their institution, they possessed a decisive superiority in war; since a regular body of infantry, in constant exercise and pay, was not maintained by any of the princes of Christendom.
 The <NORP>Janizaries</NORP> fought with the zeal of proselytes against their idolatrous countrymen; and in the battle of Cossova, the league and independence of the <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> tribes was finally crushed.
 As the conqueror walked over the field, he observed that the greatest part of the slain consisted of beardless youths; and listened to the flattering reply of his vizier, that age and wisdom would have taught them not to oppose his irresistible arms.
 But the sword of his <NORP>Janizaries</NORP> could not defend him from the dagger of despair; a <NORP>Servian</NORP> soldier started from the crowd of dead bodies, and <GPE>Amurath</GPE> was pierced in the belly with a mortal wound.
 The grandson of <PERSON>Othman</PERSON> was mild in his temper, modest in his apparel, and a lover of learning and virtue; but the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were scandalized at his absence from public worship; and he was corrected by the firmness of the mufti, who dared to reject his testimony in a civil cause: a mixture of servitude and freedom not infrequent in <NORP>Oriental</NORP> history.
 (55) The reign of <GPE>Bajazet</GPE> I.
 Ilderim, A.
D.
 1389-1403, March 9.
 The character of Bajazet, the son and successor of Amurath, is strongly expressed in his surname of Ilderim, or the lightning; and he might glory in an epithet, which was drawn from the fiery energy of his soul and the rapidity of his destructive march.
 His conquests from the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> to the Danube.
 In the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> of his reign, (56) he incessantly moved at the head of his armies, from <GPE>Boursa</GPE> to Adrianople, from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the Euphrates; and, though he strenuously labored for the propagation of the law, he invaded, with impartial ambition, the <NORP>Christian</NORP> and <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> princes of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia.
 From <GPE>Angora</GPE> to <GPE>Amasia</GPE> and Erzeroum, the northern regions of <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> were reduced to his obedience: he stripped of their hereditary possessions his brother emirs of <NORP>Ghermian</NORP> and Caramania, of <NORP>Aidin</NORP> and Sarukhan; and after the conquest of <NORP>Iconium</NORP> the ancient kingdom of the <NORP>Seljukians</NORP> again revived in the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> dynasty.
 Nor were the conquests of <GPE>Bajazet</GPE> less rapid or important in Europe.
 No sooner had he imposed a regular form of servitude on the <NORP>Servians</NORP> and Bulgarians, than he passed the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to seek new enemies and new subjects in the heart of Moldavia.
 (57) Whatever yet adhered to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire in Thrace, Macedonia, and Thessaly, acknowledged a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> master: an obsequious bishop led him through the gates of <GPE>Thermopylae</GPE> into Greece; and we may observe, as a singular fact, that the widow of a <NORP>Spanish</NORP> chief, who possessed the ancient seat of the oracle of Delphi, deserved his favour by the sacrifice of a beauteous daughter.
 The <NORP>Turkish</NORP> communication between <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> had been dangerous and doubtful, till he stationed at <GPE>Gallipoli</GPE> a fleet of galleys, to command the <PRODUCT>Hellespont</PRODUCT> and intercept the <NORP>Latin</NORP> succours of Constantinople.
 While the monarch indulged his passions in a boundless range of injustice and cruelty, he imposed on his soldiers the most rigid laws of modesty and abstinence; and the harvest was peaceably reaped and sold within the precincts of his camp.
 Provoked by the loose and corrupt administration of justice, he collected in a house the judges and lawyers of his dominions, who expected that in a few moments the fire would be kindled to reduce them to ashes.
 His ministers trembled in silence: but an <NORP>Aethiopian</NORP> buffoon presumed to insinuate the true cause of the evil; and future venality was left without excuse, by annexing an adequate salary to the office of cadhi.
 (58) The humble title of emir was no longer suitable to the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> greatness; and <GPE>Bajazet</GPE> condescended to accept a patent of sultan from the caliphs who served in <GPE>Egypt</GPE> under the yoke of the Mamalukes: (59) a last and frivolous homage that was yielded by force to opinion; by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> conquerors to the house of <PERSON>Abbas</PERSON> and the successors of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> prophet.
 The ambition of the sultan was inflamed by the obligation of deserving this august title; and he turned his arms against the kingdom of Hungary, the perpetual theatre of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> victories and defeats.
 Sigismond, the <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> king, was the son and brother of the emperors of the West: his cause was that of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and the church; and, on the report of his danger, the bravest knights of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>Germany</GPE> were eager to march under his standard and that of the cross.
 Battle of Nicopolis, A.
D.
 1396, Sept.
 28.
 In the battle of Nicopolis, <GPE>Bajazet</GPE> defeated a confederate army of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand Christians, who had proudly boasted, that if the sky should fall, they could uphold it on their lances.
 The far greater part were slain or driven into the Danube; and Sigismond, escaping to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by the river and the Black Sea, returned after a long circuit to his exhausted kingdom.
 (60) In the pride of victory, <GPE>Bajazet</GPE> threatened that he would besiege Buda; that he would subdue the adjacent countries of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, and that he would feed his horse with a bushel of oats on the altar of St.
 Peter at Rome.
 His progress was checked, not by the miraculous interposition of the apostle, not by a crusade of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> powers, but by a long and painful fit of the gout.
 The disorders of the moral, are sometimes corrected by those of the physical, world; and an acrimonious humour falling on a single fibre of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> man, may prevent or suspend the misery of nations.
 Crusade and captivity of the <NORP>French</NORP> princes, A.
D.
 1396-1398.
 Such is the general idea of the <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> war; but the disastrous adventure of the <NORP>French</NORP> has procured us some memorials which illustrate the victory and character of Bajazet.
 (61) The duke of Burgundy, sovereign of Flanders, and uncle of Charles the Sixth, yielded to the ardour of his son, <PERSON>John</PERSON> count of Nevers; and the fearless youth was accompanied by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> princes, his cousins, and those of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch.
 Their inexperience was guided by the Sire de Coucy, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the best and oldest captain of Christendom; (62) but the constable, admiral, and marshal of <GPE>France</GPE> (63) commanded an army which did not exceed the number of a thousand knights and squires.
 These splendid names were the source of presumption and the bane of discipline.
 So many might aspire to command, that none were willing to obey; their national spirit despised both their enemies and their allies; and in the persuasion that <GPE>Bajazet</GPE> would fly, or must fall, they began to compute how soon they should visit <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and deliver the holy sepulchre.
 When their scouts announced the approach of the Turks, the gay and thoughtless youths were at table, already heated with wine; they instantly clasped their armour, mounted their horses, rode full speed to the vanguard, and resented as an affront the advice of Sigismond, which would have deprived them of the right and honour of the foremost attack.
 The battle of <PERSON>Nicopolis</PERSON> would not have been lost, if the <NORP>French</NORP> would have obeyed the prudence of the Hungarians; but it might have been gloriously won, had the <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> imitated the valour of the French.
 They dispersed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> line, consisting of the troops of Asia; forced a rampart of stakes, which had been planted against the cavalry; broke, after a bloody conflict, the <NORP>Janizaries</NORP> themselves; and were at length overwhelmed by the numerous squadrons that issued from the woods, and charged on all sides this handful of intrepid warriors.
 In the speed and secrecy of his march, in the order and evolutions of the battle, his enemies felt and admired the military talents of Bajazet.
 They accuse his cruelty in the use of victory.
 After reserving the count of Nevers, and <CARDINAL>four-and-twenty</CARDINAL> lords, whose birth and riches were attested by his <NORP>Latin</NORP> interpreters, the remainder of the <NORP>French</NORP> captives, who had survived the slaughter of the day, were led before his throne; and, as they refused to abjure their faith, were successively beheaded in his presence.
 The sultan was exasperated by the loss of his bravest Janizaries; and if it be true, that, on the eve of the engagement, the <NORP>French</NORP> had massacred their <NORP>Turkish</NORP> prisoners, (64) they might impute to themselves the consequences of a just retaliation.
 A knight, whose life had been spared, was permitted to return to Paris, that he might relate the deplorable tale, and solicit the ransom of the noble captives.
 In the mean while, the count of Nevers, with the princes and barons of France, were dragged along in the marches of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> camp, exposed as a grateful trophy to the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, and strictly confined at Boursa, as often as <GPE>Bajazet</GPE> resided in his capital.
 The sultan was pressed each day to expiate with their blood the blood of his martyrs; but he had pronounced that they should live, and either for mercy or destruction his word was irrevocable.
 He was assured of their value and importance by the return of the messenger, and the gifts and intercessions of the kings of <GPE>France</GPE> and of Cyprus.
 <PERSON>Lusignan</PERSON> presented him with a gold saltcellar of curious workmanship, and of the price of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand ducats; and Charles the Sixth despatched by the way of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> a cast of <NORP>Norwegian</NORP> hawks, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> horse-loads of scarlet cloth, of fine linen of Rheims, and of <GPE>Arras</GPE> tapestry, representing the battles of the great Alexander.
 After much delay, the effect of distance rather than of art, <GPE>Bajazet</GPE> agreed to accept a ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand ducats for the count of <PERSON>Nevers</PERSON> and the surviving princes and barons: the marshal Boucicault, a famous warrior, was of the number of the fortunate; but the admiral of <GPE>France</GPE> had been slain in battle; and the constable, with the Sire de Coucy, died in the prison of Boursa.
 This heavy demand, which was doubled by incidental costs, fell chiefly on the duke of Burgundy, or rather on his <NORP>Flemish</NORP> subjects, who were bound by the feudal laws to contribute for the knighthood and captivity of the eldest son of their lord.
 For the faithful discharge of the debt, some merchants of <GPE>Genoa</GPE> gave security to the amount of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times the sum; a lesson to those warlike times, that commerce and credit are the links of the society of nations.
 It had been stipulated in the treaty, that the <NORP>French</NORP> captives should swear never to bear arms against the person of their conqueror; but the ungenerous restraint was abolished by <GPE>Bajazet</GPE> himself.
 Before their departure, they were indulged in the freedom and hospitality of the court of Boursa.
 The <NORP>French</NORP> princes admired the magnificence of the Ottoman, whose hunting and hawking equipage was composed of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand huntsmen and <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand falconers.
 (65) In their presence, and at his command, the belly of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his chamberlains was cut open, on a complaint against him for drinking the goat's milk of a poor woman.
 The strangers were astonished by this act of justice; but it was the justice of a sultan who disdains to balance the weight of evidence, or to measure the degrees of guilt.
 The emperor <PERSON>John</PERSON> Palaeologus, A.
D.
 1355, January <CARDINAL>8</CARDINAL> -1391.
 After his enfranchisement from an oppressive guardian, <PERSON>John</PERSON> <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> remained thirty-six years, the helpless, and, as it should seem, the careless spectator of the public ruin.
 (66) Love, or rather lust, was his only vigorous passion; and in the embraces of the wives and virgins of the city, the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> slave forgot the dishonour of the emperor of the Romans.
 Andronicus, his eldest son, had formed, at Adrianople, an intimate and guilty friendship with Sauzes, the son of Amurath; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> youths conspired against the authority and lives of their parents.
 The presence of <GPE>Amurath</GPE> in <LOC>Europe</LOC> soon discovered and dissipated their rash counsels; and, after depriving <PERSON>Sauzes</PERSON> of his sight, the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> threatened his vassal with the treatment of an accomplice and an enemy, unless he inflicted a similar punishment on his own son.
 <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> trembled and obeyed; and a cruel precaution involved in the same sentence the childhood and innocence of John, the son of the criminal.
 But the operation was so mildly, or so unskilfully, performed, that the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> retained the sight of an eye, and the other was afflicted only with the infirmity of squinting.
 Discord of the Greeks.
 Thus excluded from the succession, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes were confined in the tower of Anema; and the piety of Manuel, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son of the reigning monarch, was rewarded with the gift of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> crown.
 But at the end of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years, the turbulence of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> and the levity of the Greeks, produced a revolution; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors were buried in the tower from whence the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> prisoners were exalted to the throne.
 Another period of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> afforded <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> the means of escape: it was contrived by the magic or subtlety of a monk, who was alternately named the angel or the devil: they fled to Scutari; their adherents armed in their cause; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> factions displayed the ambition and animosity with which <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> had disputed the empire of the world.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> world was now contracted to a corner of Thrace, between the <LOC>Propontis</LOC> and the Black Sea, about <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> miles in length and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> in breadth; a space of ground not more extensive than the lesser principalities of <GPE>Germany</GPE> or Italy, if the remains of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had not still represented the wealth and populousness of a kingdom.
 To restore the public peace, it was found necessary to divide this fragment of the empire; and while <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> were left in possession of the capital, almost all that lay without the walls was ceded to the blind princes, who fixed their residence at <GPE>Rhodosto</GPE> and Selybria.
 In the tranquil slumber of royalty, the passions of <PERSON>John</PERSON> <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> survived his reason and his strength: he deprived his favourite and heir of a blooming princess of Trebizond; and while the feeble emperor labored to consummate his nuptials, Manuel, with a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the noblest Greeks, was sent on a peremptory summons to the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> porte.
 They served with honour in the wars of Bajazet; but a plan of fortifying <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> excited his jealousy: he threatened their lives; the new works were instantly demolished; and we shall bestow a praise, perhaps above the merit of Palaeologus, if we impute this last humiliation as the cause of his death.
 The emperor Manuel, A.
D.
 1391-1425, July 25.
 The earliest intelligence of that event was communicated to Manuel, who escaped with speed and secrecy from the palace of <GPE>Boursa</GPE> to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne.
 <GPE>Bajazet</GPE> affected a proud indifference at the loss of this valuable pledge; and while he pursued his conquests in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, he left the emperor to struggle with his blind cousin <PERSON>John</PERSON> of Selybria, who, in eight <DATE>years</DATE> of civil war, asserted his right of primogeniture.
 At length, the ambition of the victorious sultan pointed to the conquest of Constantinople; but he listened to the advice of his vizier, who represented that such an enterprise might unite the powers of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> in a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and more formidable crusade.
 His epistle to the emperor was conceived in these words: Distress of Constantinople, A.
D.
 1395- 1402.
 But his ambassadors were instructed to soften their tone, and to propose a treaty, which was subscribed with submission and gratitude.
 A truce of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was purchased by an <DATE>annual</DATE> tribute of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand crowns of gold; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> deplored the public toleration of the law of Mahomet, and <GPE>Bajazet</GPE> enjoyed the glory of establishing a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> cadhi, and founding a royal mosque in the metropolis of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> church.
 (67) Yet this truce was soon violated by the restless sultan: in the cause of the prince of Selybria, the lawful emperor, an army of <NORP>Ottomans</NORP> again threatened Constantinople; and the distress of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> implored the protection of the king of France.
 His plaintive embassy obtained much pity and some relief; and the conduct of the succour was intrusted to the marshal Boucicault, (68) whose religious chivalry was inflamed by the desire of revenging his captivity on the infidels.
 He sailed with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> ships of war, from <GPE>Aiguesmortes</GPE> to the Hellespont; forced the passage, which was guarded by <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> <NORP>Turkish</NORP> galleys; landed at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> a supply of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> men-at-arms and sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> archers; and reviewed them in the adjacent plain, without condescending to number or array the multitude of Greeks.
 By his presence, the blockade was raised both by sea and land; the flying squadrons of <GPE>Bajazet</GPE> were driven to a more respectful distance; and several castles in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> were stormed by the emperor and the marshal, who fought with equal valour by each other's side.
 But the <NORP>Ottomans</NORP> soon returned with an increase of numbers; and the intrepid Boucicault, after a year's struggle, resolved to evacuate a country which could no longer afford either pay or provisions for his soldiers.
 The marshal offered to conduct <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to the <NORP>French</NORP> court, where he might solicit in person a supply of men and money; and advised, in the mean while, that, to extinguish all domestic discord, he should leave his blind competitor on the throne.
 The proposal was embraced: the prince of <PERSON>Selybria</PERSON> was introduced to the capital; and such was the public misery, that the lot of the exile seemed more fortunate than that of the sovereign.
 Instead of applauding the success of his vassal, the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan claimed the city as his own; and on the refusal of the emperor John, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was more closely pressed by the calamities of war and famine.
 Against such an enemy prayers and resistance were alike unavailing; and the savage would have devoured his prey, if, in the fatal moment, he had not been overthrown by another savage stronger than himself.
 By the victory of <GPE>Timour</GPE> or Tamerlane, the fall of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was delayed about <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years; and this important, though accidental, service may justly introduce the life and character of the <PERSON>Mogul</PERSON> conqueror.
