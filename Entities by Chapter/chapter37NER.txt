Origin, Progress, and Effects of the Monastic Life.
—Conversion of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> to <NORP>Christianity</NORP> and Arianism.
—Persecution of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> in Africa.
—Extinction of <NORP>Arianism</NORP> among the Barbarians.
 I The Monastic Life.
 Origin of the monks.
 THE indissoluble connection of civil and ecclesiastical affairs has compelled and encouraged me to relate the progress, the persecutions, the establishment, the divisions, the final triumph, and the gradual corruption of Christianity.
 I have purposely delayed the consideration of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> religious events interesting in the study of human nature, and important in the decline and fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 I.
 The institution of the monastic life; (1) and II.
 The conversion of the northern barbarians.
 I.
 Prosperity and peace introduced the distinction of the vulgar and the <NORP>Ascetic</NORP> Christians.
 (2) The loose and imperfect practice of religion satisfied the conscience of the multitude.
 The prince or magistrate, the soldier or merchant, reconciled their fervent zeal and implicit faith with the exercise of their profession, the pursuit of their interest, and the indulgence of their passions but the Ascetics, who obeyed and abused the rigid precepts of the Gospel, were inspired by the savage enthusiasm which represents man as a criminal, and God as a tyrant.
 They seriously renounced the business and the pleasures of the age; abjured the use of wine, of flesh, and of marriage; chastised their body, mortified their affections, and embraced a life of misery, as the price of eternal happiness.
 In the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the <NORP>Ascetics</NORP> fled from a profane and degenerate world to perpetual solitude or religious society.
 Like the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Christians</NORP> of Jerusalem, (3) they resigned the use or the property of their temporal possessions; established regular communities of the same sex and a similar disposition; and assumed the names of Hermits,Monks, and Anachorets, expressive of their lonely retreat in a natural or artificial desert.
 They soon acquired the respect of the world, which they despised; and the loudest applause was bestowed on this DIVINE PHILOSOPHY, (4) which surpassed, without the aid of science or reason, the laborious virtues of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> schools.
 The monks might indeed contend with the <PERSON>Stoics</PERSON> in the contempt of fortune, of pain, and of death: the <NORP>Pythagorean</NORP> silence and submission were revived in their servile discipline; and they disdained as firmly as the <NORP>Cynics</NORP> themselves all the forms and decencies of civil society.
 But the votaries of this Divine Philosophy aspired to imitate a purer and more perfect model.
 They trod in the footsteps of the prophets, who had retired to the desert ; (5) and they restored the devout and contemplative life, which had been instituted by the <NORP>Essenians</NORP> in <GPE>Palestine</GPE> and Egypt.
 The philosophic eye of <PERSON>Pliny</PERSON> had surveyed with astonishment a solitary people, who dwelt among the palm-trees near the Dead Sea; who subsisted without money; who were propagated without women; and who derived from the disgust and repentance of mankind a perpetual supply of voluntary associates.
 (6) <PERSON>Anthony</PERSON> and the monks of Egypt, A.
D.
 305.
 Egypt, the fruitful parent of superstition, afforded the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> example of the monastic life.
 Antony, (7) an illiterate (8) youth of the lower parts of Thebais, distributed his patrimony, (9) deserted his family and native home, and executed his monastic penance with original and intrepid fanaticism.
 After a long and painful novitiate among the tombs and in a ruined tower, he boldly advanced into the desert three days' journey to the eastward of the Nile; discovered a lonely spot, which possessed the advantages of shade and water; and fixed his last residence on Mount Colzim, near the Red Sea, where an ancient monastery still preserves the name and memory of the saint.
 (10) The curious devotion of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> pursued him to the desert; and when he was obliged to appear at Alexandria, in the face of mankind, he supported his fame with discretion and dignity.
 He enjoyed the friendship of Athanasius, whose doctrine he approved; and the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> peasant respectfully declined a respectful invitation from the emperor Constantine.
 A.
D.
 251-356.
 The venerable patriarch (for <PERSON>Antony</PERSON> attained the age of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and five years) beheld the numerous progeny which had been formed by his example and his lessons.
 The prolific colonies of monks multiplied with rapid increase on the sands of Libya, upon the rocks of Thebais, and in the cities of the Nile.
 To the south of Alexandria, the mountain, and adjacent desert, of <GPE>Nitria</GPE> was peopled by five thousand anachorets; and the traveller may still investigate the ruins of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> monasteries, which were planted in that barren soil by the disciples of Antony.
 (11) In the Upper Thebais, the vacant island of Tabenne, (12) was occupied by <PERSON>Pachomius</PERSON> and fourteen hundred of his brethren.
 That holy abbot successively founded <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> monasteries of men, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of women; and the festival of <DATE>Easter</DATE> sometimes collected <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand religious persons, who followed his angelic rule of discipline.
 (13) The stately and populous city of Oxyrinchus, the seat of <NORP>Christian</NORP> orthodoxy, had devoted the temples, the public edifices, and even the ramparts, to pious and charitable uses; and the bishop, who might preach in <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> churches, computed ten thousand females, and twenty thousand males, of the monastic profession.
 (14) The Egyptians, who gloried in this marvellous revolution, were disposed to hope, and to believe, that the number of the monks was equal to the remainder of the people; (15) and posterity might repeat the saying which had formerly been applied to the sacred animals of the same country, that in <GPE>Egypt</GPE> it was less difficult to find a god than a man.
 Propagation of the monastic life at Rome, A.
D.
 341.
 <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> introduced into <GPE>Rome</GPE> the knowledge and practice of the monastic life; and a school of this new philosophy was opened by the disciples of Antony, who accompanied their primate to the holy threshold of the Vatican.
 The strange and savage appearance of these <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> excited, at first, horror and contempt, and, at length, applause and zealous imitation.
 The senators, and more especially the matrons, transformed their palaces and villas into religious houses; and the narrow institution of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <NORP>Vestals</NORP> was eclipsed by the frequent monasteries, which were seated on the ruins of ancient temples and in the midst of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> Forum.
 (16) Inflamed by the example of Antony, <GPE>Hilarion</GPE> in Palestine, A.
D.
 328.
 a <NORP>Syrian</NORP> youth, whose name was Hilarion, (17) fixed his dreary abode on a sandy beach between the sea and a morass about seven miles from Gaza.
 The austere penance, in which he persisted forty-eight years, diffused a similar enthusiasm; and the holy man was followed by a train of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or three thousand anachorets, whenever he visited the innumerable monasteries of Palestine.
 <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> in Pontus, A.
D.
 360.
 The fame of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> (18) is immortal in the monastic history of the East.
 With a mind that had tasted the learning and eloquence of Athens; with an ambition scarcely to be satisfied by the archbishopric of Casarea, <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> retired to a savage solitude in Pontus; and deigned, for a while, to give laws to the spiritual colonies which he profusely scattered along the coast of the Black Sea.
 <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> in Gaul, A.
D.
 370.
 In the West, <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> of Tours, (19) a soldier, a hermit, a bishop, and a saint, established the monasteries of Gaul; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand of his disciples followed him to the grave; and his eloquent historian challenges the deserts of <GPE>Thebais</GPE> to produce, in a more favourable climate, a champion of equal virtue.
 The progress of the monks was not less rapid or universal than that of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> itself.
 Every province, and, at last, every city, of the empire was filled with their increasing multitudes; and the bleak and barren isles, from <GPE>Lerins</GPE> to Lipari, that arise out of the Tuscan Sea, were chosen by the anachorets for the place of their voluntary exile.
 An easy and perpetual intercourse by sea and land connected the provinces of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; and the life of <GPE>Hilarion</GPE> displays the facility with which an indigent hermit of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> might traverse Egypt, embark for Sicily, escape to Epirus, and finally settle in the island of Cyprus.
 (20) The <NORP>Latin</NORP> <NORP>Christians</NORP> embraced the religious institutions of Rome.
 The pilgrims who visited <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> eagerly copied, in the most distant climates of the earth, the faithful model of the monastic life.
 The disciples of <PERSON>Antony</PERSON> spread themselves beyond the tropic, over the <NORP>Christian</NORP> empire of Ethiopia.
 (21) The monastery of <PRODUCT>Banchors</PRODUCT> (22) in Flintshire, which contained above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand brethren, dispersed a numerous colony among the barbarians of Ireland; (23) and Iona, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the Hebrides, which was planted by the <NORP>Irish</NORP> monks, diffused over the northern regions a doubtful ray of science and superstition.
 (24) Causes of its rapid progress.
 These unhappy exiles from social life were impelled by the dark and implacable genius of superstition.
 Their mutual resolution was supported by the example of millions, of either sex, of every age, and of every rank; and each proselyte who entered the gates of a monastery was persuaded that he trod the steep and thorny path of eternal happiness.
 (25) But the operation of these religious motives was variously determined by the temper and situation of mankind.
 Reason might subdue, or passion might suspend, their influence; but they acted most forcibly on the infirm minds of children and females; they were strengthened by secret remorse or accidental misfortune; and they might derive some aid from the temporal considerations of vanity or interest.
 It was naturally supposed that the pious and humble monks, who had renounced the world to accomplish the work of their salvation, were the best qualified for the spiritual government of the Christians.
 The reluctant hermit was torn from his cell, and seated amidst the acclamations of the people, on the episcopal throne: the monasteries of Egypt, of Gaul, and of the East, supplied a regular succession of saints and bishops; and ambition soon discovered the secret road which led to the possession of wealth and honours.
 (26) The popular monks, whose reputation was connected with the fame and success of the order, assiduously laboured to multiply the number of their fellow-captives.
 They insinuated themselves into noble and opulent families, and the specious arts of flattery and seduction were employed to secure those proselytes who might bestow wealth or dignity on the monastic profession.
 The indignant father bewailed the loss, perhaps, of an only son; (27) the credulous maid was betrayed by vanity to violate the laws of nature; and the matron aspired to imaginary perfection by renouncing the virtues of domestic life.
 <PERSON>Paula</PERSON> yielded to the persuasive eloquence of Jerom; (28) and the profane title of mother-in-law of God (29) tempted that illustrious widow to consecrate the virginity of her daughter Eustochium.
 By the advice, and in the company, of her spiritual guide, <PERSON>Paula</PERSON> abandoned <GPE>Rome</GPE> and her infant son; retired to the holy village of Bethlem; founded an hospital and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> monasteries and acquired, by her alms and penance, an eminent and conspicuous station in the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 Such rare and illustrious penitents were celebrated as the glory and example of their age; but the monasteries were filled by a crowd of obscure and abject plebeians, (30) who gained in the cloister much more than they had sacrificed in the world.
 Peasants, slaves, and mechanics might escape from poverty and contempt to a safe and honourable profession, whose apparent hardships were mitigated by custom, by popular applause, and by the secret relaxation of discipline.
 (31) The subjects of Rome, whose persons and fortunes were made responsible for unequal and exorbitant tributes, retired from the oppression of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> government; and the pusillanimous youth preferred the penance of a monastic, to the dangers of a military, life.
 The affrighted provincials of every rank, who fled before the barbarians, found shelter and subsistence; whole legions were buried in these religious sanctuaries; and the same cause which relieved the distress of individuals impaired the strength and fortitude of the empire.
 (32) Obedience of the monks.
 The monastic profession of the ancients (33) was an act of voluntary devotion.
 The inconstant fanatic was threatened with the eternal vengeance of the God whom he deserted, but the doors of the monastery were still open for repentance.
 Those monks whose conscience was fortified by reason or passion were at liberty to resume the character of men and citizens; and even the spouses of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> might accept the legal embraces of an earthly lover.
 (34) The examples of scandal, and the progress of superstition, suggested the propriety of more forcible restraints.
 After a sufficient trial, the fidelity of the novice was secured by a solemn and perpetual vow; and his irrevocable engagement was ratified by the laws of the church and state.
 A guilty fugitive was pursued, arrested, and restored to his perpetual prison; and the interposition of the magistrate oppressed the freedom and merit which had alleviated, in some degree, the abject slavery of the monastic discipline.
 (35) The actions of a monk, his words, and even his thoughts, were determined.
 by an inflexible rule (36) or a capricious superior: the slightest offences were corrected by disgrace or confinement, extraordinary fasts, or bloody flagellation; and disobedience, murmur, or delay were ranked in the catalogue of the most heinous sins.
 (37) A blind submission to the commands of the abbot, however absurd, or even criminal, they might seem, was the ruling principle, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> virtue of the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> monks; and their patience was frequently exercised by the most extravagant trials.
 They were directed to remove an enormous rock; assiduously to water a barren staff that was planted in the ground, till, at the end of three years, it should vegetate and blossom like a tree; to walk into a fiery furnace; or to cast their infant into a deep pond: and several saints, or madmen, have been immortalised in monastic story by their thoughtless and fearless obedience.
 (38) The freedom of the mind, the source of every generous and rational sentiment, was destroyed by the habits of credulity and submission; and the monk, contracting the vices of a slave, devoutly followed the faith and passions of his ecclesiastical tyrant.
 The peace of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> church was invaded by a swarm of fanatics, incapable of fear, or reason, or humanity; and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops acknowledged, without shame, that they were much less apprehensive of an encounter with the fiercest barbarians.
 (39) Their dress and habitations.
 Superstition has often framed and consecrated the fantastic garments of the monks: (40) but their apparent singularity sometimes proceeds from their uniform attachment to a simple and primitive model, which the revolutions of fashion have made ridiculous in the eyes of mankind.
 The father of the <PERSON>Benedictines</PERSON> expressly disclaims all idea of choice or merit; and soberly exhorts his disciples to adopt the coarse and convenient dress of the countries which they may inhabit.
 (41) The monastic habits of the ancients varied with the climate and their mode of life; and they assumed, with the same indifference, the sheepskin of the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> peasants or the cloak of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> philosophers.
 They allowed themselves the use of linen in Egypt, where it was a cheap and domestic manufacture; but in the <LOC>West</LOC> they rejected such an expensive article of foreign luxury.
 (42) It was the practice of the monks either to cut or shave their hair; they wrapped their heads in a cowl, to escape the sight of profane objects; their legs and feet were naked, except in the extreme cold of winter; and their slow and feeble steps were supported by a long staff.
 The aspect of a genuine anachoret was horrid and disgusting: every sensation that is offensive to man was thought acceptable to God; and the angelic rule of <GPE>Tabenne</GPE> condemned the salutary custom of bathing the limbs in water and of anointing them with oil.
 (43) The austere monks slept on the ground, on a hard mat or a rough blanket; and the same bundle of palm-leaves served them as a seat in the day and a pillow in the night.
 Their original cells were low narrow huts, built of the slightest materials; which formed, by the regular distribution of the streets, a large and populous village, enclosing, within the common wall, a church, a hospital, perhaps a library, some necessary offices, a garden, and a fountain or reservoir of fresh water.
 Thirty or forty brethren composed a family of separate discipline and diet; and the great monasteries of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> consisted of thirty or forty families.
 Their diet.
 Pleasure and guilt are synonymous terms in the language of the monks, and they had discovered, by experience, that rigid fasts and abstemious diet are the most effectual preservatives against the impure desires of the flesh.
 (44) The rules of abstinence which they imposed, or practised, were not uniform or perpetual: the cheerful festival of the <EVENT>Pentecost</EVENT> was balanced by the extraordinary mortification of Lent; the fervour of new monasteries was insensibly relaxed; and the voracious appetite of the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> could not imitate the patient and temperate virtue of the Egyptians.
 (45) The disciples of <PERSON>Antony</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pachomius</PERSON> were satisfied with their daily pittance (46) of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> ounces of bread, or rather biscuit, (47) which they divided into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> frugal repasts, of the afternoon and of the evening.
 It was esteemed a merit, and almost a duty, to abstain from the boiled vegetables which were provided for the refectory; but the extraordinary bounty of the abbot sometimes indulged them with the luxury of cheese, fruit, salad, and the small dried fish of the Nile.
 (48) A more ample latitude of sea and river fish was gradually allowed or assumed; but the use of flesh was long confined to the sick or travellers: and when it gradually prevailed in the less rigid monasteries of Europe, a singular distinction was introduced; as if birds, whether wild or domestic, had been less profane than the grosser animals of the field.
 Water was the pure and innocent beverage of the primitive monks; and the founder of the <PERSON>Benedictines</PERSON> regrets the daily portion of <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> a pint of wine which had been extorted from him by the intemperance of the age.
 (49) Such an allowance might be easily supplied by the vineyard of Italy; and his victorious disciples, who passed the Alps, the Rhine, and the Baltic, required, in the place of wine, an adequate compensation of strong beer or cider.
 Their manual labour.
 The candidate who aspired to the virtue of evangelical poverty, abjured, at his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> entrance to a regular community, the idea, and even the name, of all separate or exclusive possession.
 (50) The brethren were supported by their manual labour; and the duty of labour was strenuously recommended as a penance, as an exercise, and as the most laudable means of securing their daily subsistence.
 (51) The garden and fields, which the industry of the monks had often rescued from the forest or the morass, were diligently cultivated by their hands.
 They performed, without reluctance, the menial offices of slaves and domestics; and the several trades that were necessary to provide their habits, their utensils, and their lodging, were exercised within the precincts of the great monasteries.
 The monastic studies have tended, for the most part to darken, rather than to dispel, the cloud of superstition.
 Yet the curiosity or zeal of some learned solitaries has cultivated the ecclesiastical and even the profane sciences: and posterity must gratefully acknowledge that the monuments of <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Roman</NORP> literature have been preserved and multiplied by their indefatigable pens.
 (52) But the more humble industry of the monks, especially in Egypt, was contented with the silent, sedentary occupation of making wooden sandals, or of twisting the leaves of the palm-tree into mats and baskets.
 The superfluous stock, which was not consumed in domestic use, supplied, by trade, the wants of the community: the boats of Tabenne, and the other monasteries of Thebais, descended the <LOC>Nile</LOC> as far as Alexandria; and, in a <NORP>Christian</NORP> market, the sanctity of the workmen might enhance the intrinsic value of the work.
 Their riches.
 But the necessity of manual labour was insensibly superseded.
 The novice was tempted to bestow his fortune on the saints in whose society he was resolved to spend the remainder of his life; and the pernicious indulgence of the laws permitted him to receive, for their use, any future accessions of legacy or inheritance.
 (53) <PERSON>Mezanla</PERSON> contributed her plate, three hundred pounds' weight of silver, and <PERSON>Paula</PERSON> contracted an immense debt for the relief of their favourite monks, who kindly imparted the merits of their prayers and penance to a rich and liberal sinner.
 (54) Time continually increased, and accidents could seldom diminish, the estates of the popular monasteries, which spread over the adjacent country and cities: and, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> century of their institution, the infidel <PERSON>Zosimus</PERSON> has maliciously observed, that, for the benefit of the poor, the <NORP>Christian</NORP> monks had reduced a great part of mankind to a state of beggary.
 (55) As long as they maintained their original fervour, they approved themselves, however, the faithful and benevolent stewards of the charity which was intrusted to their care.
 But their discipline was corrupted by prosperity: they gradually assumed the pride of wealth, and at last indulged the luxury of expense.
 Their public luxury might be excused by the magnificence of religious worship, and the decent motive of erecting durable habitations for an immortal society.
 But every age of the church has accused the licentiousness of the degenerate monks; who no longer remembered the object of their institution, embraced the vain and sensual pleasures of the world which they had renounced, (56) and scandalously abused the riches which had been acquired by the austere virtues of their founders.
 (57) Their natural descent, from such painful and dangerous virtue, to the common vices of humanity, will not, perhaps, excite much grief or indignation in the mind of a philosopher.
 Their solitude.
 The lives of the primitive monks were consumed in penance and solitude, undisturbed by the various occupations which fill the time, and exercise the faculties, of reasonable, active, and social beings.
 Whenever they were permitted to step beyond the precincts of the monastery, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> jealous companions were the mutual guards and spies of each other's actions; and, after their return, they were condemned to forget, or, at least, to suppress, whatever they had seen or heard in the world.
 Strangers, who professed the orthodox faith, were hospitably entertained in a separate apartment; but their dangerous conversation was restricted to some chosen elders of approved discretion and fidelity.
 Except in their presence, the monastic slave might not receive the visits of his friends or kindred; and it was deemed highly meritorious, if he afflicted a tender sister, or an aged parent, by the obstinate refusal of a word or look.
 (58) The monks themselves passed their lives, without personal attachments, among a crowd which had been formed by accident, and was detained, in the same prison, by force or prejudice.
 Recluse fanatics have few ideas or sentiments to communicate: a special licence of the abbot regulated the time and duration of their familiar visits; and, at their silent meals, they were enveloped in their cowls, inaccessible, and almost invisible, to each other.
 (59) Study is the resource of solitude; but education had not prepared and qualified for any liberal studies the mechanics and peasants who filled the monastic communities.
 They might work; but the vanity of spiritual perfection was tempted to disdain the exercise of manual labour; and the industry must be faint and languid which is not excited by the sense of personal interest.
 Their devotion and visions.
 According to their faith and zeal, they might employ the day, which they passed in their cells, either in vocal or mental prayer: they assembled in the evening, and they were awakened in the night, for the public worship of the monastery.
 The precise moment was determined by the stars, which are seldom clouded in the serene sky of Egypt; and a rustic horn, or trumpet, the signal of devotion, twice interrupted the vast silence of the desert.
 (60) Even sleep, the last refuge of the unhappy, was rigorously measured: the vacant hours of the monk heavily rolled along, without business or pleasure; and, before the close of each day, he had repeatedly accused the tedious progress of the sun.
 (61) In this comfortless state, superstition still pursued and tormented her wretched votaries.
 (62) The repose which they had sought in the cloister was disturbed by tardy repentance, profane doubts, and guilty desires; and, while they considered each natural impulse as an unpardonable sin, they perpetually trembled on the edge of a flaming and bottomless abyss.
 From the painful struggles of disease and despair, these unhappy victims were sometimes relieved by madness or death; and, in the sixth century, a hospital was founded at <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> for a small portion of the austere penitents who were deprived of their senses.
 (63) Their visions, before they attained this extreme and acknowledged term of frenzy, have afforded ample materials of supernatural history.
 It was their firm persuasion that the air which they breathed was peopled with invisible enemies; with innumerable demons, who watched every occasion, and assumed every form, to terrify, and above all to tempt, their unguarded virtue.
 The imagination, and even the senses, were deceived by the illusions of distempered fanaticism; and the hermit, whose midnight prayer was oppressed by involuntary slumber, might easily confound the phantoms of horror or delight which had occupied his sleeping and his waking dreams.
 (64) The <PERSON>Caenobites</PERSON> and Anachorets.
 The monks were divided into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes: the Coenobites, who lived under a common and regular discipline, and the Anachorets, who indulged their unsocial, independent fanaticism.
 (65) The most devout, or the most ambitious, of the spiritual brethren renounced the convent, as they had renounced the world.
 The fervent monasteries of Egypt, Palestine, and <GPE>Syria</GPE> were surrounded by a Laura, (66) a distant circle of solitary cells; and the extravagant penance of the <PERSON>Hermits</PERSON> was stimulated by applause and emulation.
 (67) They sunk under the painful weight of crosses and chains; and their emaciated limbs were confined by collars, bracelets, gauntlets and greaves of massy and rigid iron.
 All superfluous incumbrance of dress they contemptuously cast away; and some savage saints of both sexes have been admired, whose naked bodies were only covered by their long hair.
 They aspired to reduce themselves to the rude and miserable state in which the human brute is scarcely distinguished above his kindred animals; and the numerous sect of <NORP>Anachorets</NORP> derived their name from their humble practice of grazing in the fields of <LOC>Mesopotamia</LOC> with the common herd.
 (68) They often usurped the den of some wild beast whom they affected to resemble; they buried themselves in some gloomy cavern, which art or nature had scooped out of the rock; and the marble quarries of <GPE>Thebais</GPE> are still inscribed with the monuments of their penance.
 (69) The most perfect <PERSON>Hermits</PERSON> are supposed to have passed many days without food, many nights without sleep, and many years without speaking; and glorious was the man (I abuse that name) who contrived any cell, or seat, of a peculiar construction, which might expose him, in the most inconvenient posture, to the inclemency of the seasons.
 <PERSON>Simeon</PERSON> Stylites, A.
D.
 395-451.
 Among these heroes of the monastic life, the name and genius of <PERSON>Simeon</PERSON> Stylites (70) have been immortalised by the singular invention of an aerial penance.
 At the age of thirteen the young <NORP>Syrian</NORP> deserted the profession of a shepherd, and threw himself into an austere monastery.
 After a long and painful novitiate, in which <PERSON>Simeon</PERSON> was repeatedly saved from pious suicide, he established his residence on a mountain, about thirty or forty miles to the east of Antioch.
 Within the space of a mandra, or circle of stones to which he had attached himself by a ponderous chain, he ascended a column, which was successively raised from the height of nine, to that of sixty, feet from the ground.
 (71) In this last and lofty station, the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> Anachoret resisted the heat of thirty summers, and the cold of as many winters.
 Habit and exercise instructed him to maintain his dangerous situation with out fear or giddiness, and successively to assume the different postures of devotion.
 He sometimes prayed in an erect attitude, with his outstretched arms in the figure of a cross; but his most familiar practice was that of bending his meagre skeleton from the forehead to the feet; and a curious spectator, after numbering <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-four repetitions, at length desisted from the endless account.
 The progress of an ulcer in his thigh (72) might shorten, but it could not disturb, this celestial life; and the patient <PERSON>Hermit</PERSON> expired without descending from his column.
 A prince, who should capriciously inflict such tortures, would be deemed a tyrant; but it would surpass the power of a tyrant to impose a long and miserable existence on the reluctant victims of his cruelty.
 This voluntary martyrdom must have gradually destroyed the sensibility both of the mind and body; nor can it be presumed that the fanatics who torment themselves are susceptible of any lively affection for the rest of mankind.
 A cruel, unfeeling temper has distinguished the monks of every age and country: their stern indifference, which is seldom mollified by personal friendship, is inflamed by religious hatred; and their merciless zeal has strenuously administered the holy office of the Inquisition.
 Miracles and worship of the monks.
 The monastic saints, who excite only the contempt and pity of a philosopher, were respected and almost adored by the prince and people.
 Successive crowds of pilgrims from <LOC>Gaul</LOC> and <GPE>India</GPE> saluted the divine pillar of Simeon; the tribes of <NORP>Saracens</NORP> disputed in arms the honour of his benediction, the queens of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> and <GPE>Persia</GPE> gratefully confessed his supernatural virtue; and the angelic <PERSON>Hermit</PERSON> was consulted by the younger <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> in the most important concerns of the church and state.
 His remains were transported from the mountain of Telenissa, by a solemn procession of the patriarch, the master-general of the East, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> bishops, <CARDINAL>twenty-one</CARDINAL> counts or tribunes, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand soldiers; and <PERSON>Antioch</PERSON> revered his bones as her glorious ornament and impregnable defence.
 The fame of the apostles and martyrs was gradually eclipsed by these recent and popular Anachorets; the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world fell prostrate before their shrines; and the miracles ascribed to their relics exceeded, at least in number and duration, the spiritual exploits on their lives.
 But the golden legend of their lives (73) was embellished by the artful credulity of their interested brethren; and a believing age was easily persuaded that the slightest caprice of an <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> or a <NORP>Syrian</NORP> monk had been sufficient to interrupt the eternal laws of the universe.
 The favourites of Heaven were accustomed to cure inveterate diseases with a touch, a word, or a distant message; and to expel the most obstinate demons from the souls or bodies which they possessed.
 They familiarly accosted, or imperiously commanded, the lions and serpents of the desert; infused vegetation into a sapless trunk; suspended iron on the surface of the water; passed the <LOC>Nile</LOC> on the back of a crocodile; and refreshed themselves in a fiery furnace.
 These extravagant tales, which display the fiction, without the genius, of poetry, have seriously affected the reason, the faith, and the morals of the Christians.
 Superstition of the age.
 Their credulity debased and vitiated the faculties of the mind: they corrupted the evidence of history; and superstition gradually extinguished the hostile light of philosophy and science.
 Every mode of religious worship which had been practised by the saints, every mysterious doctrine which they believed, was fortified by the sanction of divine revelation, and all the manly virtues were oppressed by the servile and pusillanimous reign of the monks.
 If it be possible to measure the interval between the philosophic writings of <PERSON>Cicero</PERSON> and the sacred legend of Theodoret, between the character of <PERSON>Cato</PERSON> and that of Simeon, we may appreciate the memorable revolution which was accomplished in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire within a period of five hundred years.
 II.
 CONVERSION OF THE BARBARIANS.
 The progress of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> has been marked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> glorious and decisive victories: over the learned and luxurious citizens of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire; and over the warlike barbarians of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> and Germany, who subverted the empire and embraced the religion of the Romans.
 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> were the foremost of these savage proselytes; and the nation was indebted for its conversion to a countryman, or at least to a subject, worthy to be ranked among the inventors of useful arts who have deserved the remembrance and gratitude of posterity.
 A great number of <NORP>Roman</NORP> provincials had been led away into captivity by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> bands who ravaged <LOC>Asia</LOC> in the time of Gallienus; and of these captives many were Christians, and several belonged to the ecclesiastical order.
 Those involuntary missionaries, dispersed as slaves in the villages of Dacia, successively laboured for the salvation of their masters.
 The seeds which they planted of the evangelic doctrine were gradually propagated; and before the end of a century the pious work was achieved by the labours of Ulphilas, whose ancestors had been transported beyond the <LOC>Danube</LOC> from a small town of Cappadocia.
 Ulphilas, apostle of the Goths, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>360</CARDINAL> etc.
 Ulphilas, the bishop and apostle of the Goths, (74) acquired their love and reverence by his blameless life and indefatigable zeal, and they received with implicit confidence the doctrines of truth and virtue which he preached and practised.
 He executed the arduous task of translating the <WORK_OF_ART>Scriptures</WORK_OF_ART> into their native tongue, a dialect of the <LANGUAGE>German</LANGUAGE> or <LANGUAGE>Teutonic</LANGUAGE> language; but he prudently suppressed the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> books of Kings, as they might tend to irritate the fierce and sanguinary spirit of the barbarians.
 The rude, imperfect idiom of soldiers and shepherds, so ill qualified to communicate any spiritual ideas, was improved and modulated by his genius; and Ulphilas, before he could frame his version, was obliged to compose a new alphabet of <CARDINAL>twenty-four</CARDINAL> letters; <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> of which he invented to express the peculiar sounds that were unknown to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Latin</NORP> pronunciation.
 (75) But the prosperous state of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> church was soon afflicted by war and intestine discord, and the chieftains were divided by religion as well as by interest.
 Fritigern, the friend of the Romans, became the proselyte of Ulphilas; while the haughty soul of <PERSON>Athanaric</PERSON> disdained the yoke of the empire and of the Gospel.
 The faith of the new converts was tried by the persecution which he excited.
 A waggon, bearing aloft the shapeless image of Thor, perhaps, or of Woden, was conducted in solemn procession through the streets of the camp, and the rebels who refused to worship the god of their fathers were immediately burnt with their tents and families.
 The character of <PERSON>Ulphilas</PERSON> recommended him to the esteem of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> court, where he twice appeared as the minister of peace, he pleaded the cause of the distressed Goths, who implored the protection of Valens; and the name of 'Moses' was applied to this spiritual guide, who conducted his people through the deep waters of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the Land of Promise.
 (76) The devout shepherds, who were attached to his person and tractable to his voice, acquiesced in their settlement at the foot of the Maesian mountains, in a country of woodlands and pastures, which supported their flocks, and herds, and enabled them to purchase the corn and wine of the more plentiful provinces.
 These harmless barbarians multiplied in obscure peace and the profession of Christianity.
 (77) The Goths, Vandals, Burgundians, etc, embrace Christianity, A.
D.
 400, etc.
 Their fiercer brethren, the formidable Visigoths, universally adopted the religion of the Romans, with whom they maintained a perpetual intercourse of war, of friendship, or of conquest.
 In their long and victorious march from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean they converted their allies; they educated the rising generation; and the devotion which reigned in the camp of Alaric, or the court of <GPE>Toulouse</GPE> might edify or disgrace the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Constantinople.
 (78) During the same period <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was embraced by almost all the barbarians who established their kingdoms on the ruins of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire; the <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> in Gaul, the <NORP>Suevi</NORP> in Spain, the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> in Africa, the <NORP>Ostrogoths</NORP> in Pannonia, and the various bands of mercenaries that raised <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> to the throne of Italy.
 The <NORP>Franks</NORP> and the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> still persevered in the errors of Paganism, but the <NORP>Franks</NORP> obtained the monarchy of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> by their submission to the example of Clovis; and the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> conquerors of <GPE>Britain</GPE> were reclaimed from their savage superstition by the missionaries of Rome.
 These barbarian proselytes displayed an ardent and successful zeal in the propagation of the faith.
 The <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> kings and their successors, <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> and the Othos, extended by their laws and victories the dominion of the cross.
 <GPE>England</GPE> produced the apostle of Germany; and the evangelic light was gradually diffused from the neighbourhood of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the nations of the Elbe, the Vistula, and the Baltic.
 (79) Motives of their faith.
 The different motives which influenced the reason or the passions of the barbarian converts cannot easily be ascertained.
 They were often capricious and accidental; a dream, an omen, the report of a miracle, the example of some priest or hero, the charms of a believing wife, and, above all, the fortunate event of a prayer or vow which, in a moment of danger, they had addressed to the God of the Christians.
 (80) The early prejudices of education were insensibly erased by the habits of frequent and familiar society; the moral precepts of the <WORK_OF_ART>Gospel</WORK_OF_ART> were protected by the extravagant virtues of the monks; and a spiritual theology was supported by the visible power of relics, and the pomp of religious worship.
 But the rational and ingenious mode of persuasion which a <NORP>Saxon</NORP> bishop (81) suggested to a popular saint might sometimes be employed by the missionaries who laboured for the conversion of infidels.
 This metaphysical reasoning, too refined perhaps for the barbarians of Germany, was fortified by the grosser weight of authority and popular consent.
 The advantage of temporal prosperity had deserted the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> cause and passed over to the service of Christianity.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, the most powerful and enlightened nation of the globe, had renounced their ancient superstition; and if the ruin of their empire seemed to accuse the efficacy of the new faith, the disgrace was already retrieved by the conversion of the victorious Goths.
 The valiant and fortunate barbarians who subdued the provinces of the <LOC>West</LOC> successively received and reflected the same edifying example.
 Before the age of Charlemagne, the <NORP>Christian</NORP> nations of <LOC>Europe</LOC> might exult in the exclusive possession of the temperate climates, of the fertile lands which produced corn, wine, and oil; while the savage idolaters and their helpless idols were confined to the extremities of the earth, the dark and frozen regions of the North.
 (82) Effects of their conversion.
 Christianity, which opened the gates of Heaven to the barbarians, introduced an important change in their moral and political condition.
 They received, at the same time, the use of letters, so essential to a religion whose doctrines are contained in a sacred book, and while they studied the divine truth, their minds were insensibly enlarged by the distant view of history, of nature, of the arts, and of society.
 The version of the <WORK_OF_ART>Sciptures</WORK_OF_ART> into their native tongue which had facilitated their conversion, must excite, among their clergy, some curiosity to read he original text, to understand the sacred liturgy of the church, and to examine, in the writings of the fathers, the chain of ecclesiastical tradition.
 These spiritual gifts were preserved in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Latin</NORP> languages, which concealed the inestimable monuments of ancient learning.
 The immortal productions of Virgil, Cicero, and Livy, which were accessible to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> barbarians, maintained a silent intercourse between the reign of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and the times of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> and Charlemagne.
 The emulation of mankind was encouraged by the remembrance of a more perfect state; and the flame of science was secretly kept alive, to warm and enlighten the mature age of the <NORP>Western</NORP> world.
 In the most corrupt state of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> the barbarians might learn justice from the law, and mercy from the gospel; and if the knowledge of their duty was insufficient to guide their actions or to regulate their passions, they were sometimes restrained by conscience, and frequently punished by remorse.
 But the direct authority of religion was less effectual than the holy communion, which united them with their <NORP>Christian</NORP> brethren in spiritual friendship.
 The influence of these sentiments contributed to secure their fidelity in the service or the alliance of the Romans, to alleviate the horrors of war, to moderate the insolence of conquest, and to preserve, in the downfall of the empire, a permanent respect for the name and institutions of Rome.
 In the days of <NORP>Paganism</NORP> the priests of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> and <GPE>Germany</GPE> reigned over the people, and controlled the jurisdiction of the magistrates; and the zealous proselytes transferred an equal, or more ample, measure of devout obedience to the pontiffs of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith.
 The sacred character of the bishops was supported by their temporal possessions; they obtained an honourable seat in the legislative assemblies of soldiers and freemen; and it was their interest, as well as their duty, to mollify by peaceful counsels the fierce spirit of the barbarians.
 The perpetual correspondence of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy, the frequent pilgrimages to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Jerusalem, and the growing authority of the popes, cemented the union of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> republic, and gradually produced the similar manners and common jurisprudence which have distinguished from the rest of mankind the independent, and even hostile, nations of modern Europe.
 They are involved in the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 But the operation of these causes was checked and retarded by the unfortunate accident which infused a deadly poison into the cup of salvation.
 Whatever might be the early sentiments of Ulphilas, his connections with the empire and the church were formed during the reign of Arianism.
 The apostle of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> subscribed the creed of Rimini; professed with freedom, and perhaps with sincerity, that the <PERSON>Son</PERSON> was not equal or consubstantial to the FATHER,(83) communicated these errors to the clergy and people; and infected the barbaric world with an heresy (84) which the great <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> proscribed and extinguished among the Romans.
 The temper and understanding of the new proselytes were not adapted to metaphysical subtleties; but they strenuously maintained what they had piously received as the pure and genuine doctrines of Christianity.
 The advantage of preaching and expounding the <WORK_OF_ART>Scriptures</WORK_OF_ART> in the <LANGUAGE>Teutonic</LANGUAGE> language promoted the apostolic labours of <PERSON>Ulphilas</PERSON> and his successors; and they ordained a competent number of bishops and presbyters for the instruction of the kindred tribes.
 The Ostrogoths, the Burgundians, the Suevi, and the Vandals, who had listened to the eloquence of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> clergy, (85) preferred the more intelligible lessons of their domestic teachers; and <NORP>Arianism</NORP> was adopted as the national faith of the warlike converts who were seated on the ruins of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 This irreconcilable difference of religion was a perpetual source of jealousy and hatred; and the reproach of <PERSON>Barbarian</PERSON> was embittered by the more odious epithet of Heretic.
 The heroes of the North, who had submitted with some reluctance to believe that all their ancestors were in hell, (86) were astonished and exasperated to learn that they themselves had only changed the mode of their eternal condemnation.
 Instead of the smooth applause which <NORP>Christian</NORP> kings are accustomed to expect, from their loyal prelates, the orthodox bishops and their clergy were in a state of opposition to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> courts; and their indiscreet opposition frequently became criminal, and might sometimes be dangerous.
 (87) The pulpit, that safe and sacred organ of sedition, resounded with the names of <PERSON>Pharaoh</PERSON> and Holofernes; (88) the public discontent was inflamed by the hope or promise of a glorious deliverance; and the seditious saints were tempted to promote the accomplishment of their own predictions.
 General toleration.
 Notwithstanding these provocations, the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> of Gaul, Spain, and <GPE>Italy</GPE> enjoyed, under the reign of the Arians, the free and peaceful exercise of their religion.
 Their haughty masters respected the zeal of a numerous people, resolved to die at the foot of their altars, and the example of their devout constancy was admired and imitated by the barbarians themselves.
 The conquerors evaded, however, the disgraceful reproach, or confession, of fear, by attributing their toleration to the liberal motives of reason and humanity; and while they affected the language, they imperceptibly imbibed the spirit, of genuine Christianity.
 <NORP>Arian</NORP> persecution of the Vandals.
 The peace of the church was sometimes interrupted.
 The catholics were indiscreet, the barbarians were impatient; and the partial acts of severity or injustice, which had been recommended by the <NORP>Arian</NORP> clergy, were exaggerated by the orthodox writers.
 The guilt of persecution may be imputed to Euric, king of the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> who suspended the exercise of ecclesiastical, or, at least, of episcopal functions, and punished the popular bishops of <PERSON>Aquitain</PERSON> with imprisonment, exile, and confiscation.
 (89) But the cruel and absurd enterprise of subduing the minds of a whole people was undertaken by the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> alone.
 Genseric, A.
D.
 429-477.
 <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> himself, in his early youth, had renounced the orthodox communion; and the apostate could neither grant nor expect a sincere forgiveness.
 He was exasperated to find that the Africans, who had fled before him in the field, still presumed to dispute his will in synods and churches; and his ferocious mind was incapable of fear or of compassion.
 His catholic subjects were oppressed by intolerant laws and arbitrary punishments.
 The language of <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> was furious and formidable; the knowledge of his intentions might justify the most unfavourable interpretation of his actions; and the <NORP>Arians</NORP> were reproached with the frequent executions which stained the palace and the dominions of the tyrant.
 Arms and ambition were, however, the ruling passions of the monarch of the sea.
 Hunneric, A.
D.
 477.
 But Hunneric, his inglorious son, who seemed to inherit only his vices, tormented the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> with the same unrelenting fury which had been fatal to his brother, his nephews, and the friends and favourites of his father; and even to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> patriarch, who was inhumanly burnt alive in the midst of Carthage.
 The religious war was preceded and prepared by an insidious truce; persecution was made the serious and important business of the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> court; and the loathsome disease which hastened the death of <PERSON>Hunneric</PERSON> revenged the injuries, without contributing to the deliverance, of the church.
 The throne of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was successively filled by the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nephews of Hunneric;Gundamund, A.
D.
 484.
 by Gundamund, who reigned about twelve, and by Thrasimund, who governed the nation above twenty-seven, years.
 Their administration was hostile and oppressive to the orthodox party.
 <PERSON>Gundamund</PERSON> appeared to emulate, or even to surpass, the cruelty of his uncle; and if at length he relented, if he recalled the bishops, and restored the freedom of <NORP>Athanasian</NORP> worship, a premature death intercepted the benefits of his tardy clemency.
Thrasimund, A.
D.
 496.
 His brother, Thrasimund, was the greatest and most accomplished of the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> kings, whom he excelled in beauty, prudence, and magnanimity of soul.
 But this magnanimous character was degraded by his intolerant zeal and deceitful clemency.
 Instead of threats and tortures, he employed the gentle, but efficacious, powers of seduction.
 Wealth, dignity, and the royal favour were the liberal rewards of apostacy; the catholics who had violated the laws might purchase their pardon by the renunciation of their faith; and whenever <LAW>Thrasimund</LAW> mediated any rigorous measure, he patiently waited till the indiscretion of his adversaries furnished him with a specious opportunity.
 Bigotry was his last sentiment in the hour of death; and he exacted from his successor a solemn oath that he would never tolerate the sectaries of Athanasius.
 Hilderic, A.
D.
 523.
 But his successor, Hilderic, the gentle son of the savage Hunneric, preferred the duties of humanity and justice to the vain obligation of an impious oath; and his accession was gloriously marked by the restoration of peace and universal freedom.
 Gelimer, A.
D.
 530.
 The throne of that virtuous, though feeble, monarch was usurped by his cousin Gelimer, a zealous Arian: but the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> kingdom, before he could enjoy or abuse his power, was subverted by the arms of Belisarius; and the orthodox party retaliated the injuries which they had endured.
 (90) A general view of the persecution in Africa.
 The passionate declamations of the catholics, the sole historians of this persecution, cannot afford any distinct series of causes and events, any impartial view of characters or counsels; but the most remarkable circumstances that deserve either credit or notice may be referred to the following heads: I.
 In the original law which is still extant, (91) <PERSON>Hunneric</PERSON> expressly declares, and the declaration appears to be correct, that he had faithfully transcribed the regulations and penalties of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> edicts against the heretical congregations, the clergy, and the people, who dissented from the established religion.
 If the rights of conscience had been understood, the catholics must have condemned their past conduct, or acquiesced in their actual sufferings.
 But they still persisted to refuse the indulgence which they claimed.
 While they trembled under the lash of persecution, they praised the laudable severity of <PERSON>Hunneric</PERSON> himself, who burnt or banished great numbers of Manicheans; (92) and they rejected with horror the ignominious compromise that the disciples of <PERSON>Arius</PERSON> and of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> should enjoy a reciprocal and similar toleration in the territories of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and in those of the Vandals.
(93) II.
 The practice of a conference, which the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> had so frequently used to insult and punish their obstinate antagonists, was retorted against themselves.
 (94) At the command of Hunneric, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty-six orthodox bishops assembled at Carthage; but when they were admitted into the hall of audience, they had the mortification of beholding the <NORP>Arian</NORP> Cyrila, exalted on the patriarchal throne.
 The disputants were separated, after the mutual and ordinary reproaches of noise and silence, of delay and precipitation, of military force and of popular clamour.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> martyr and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> confessor were selected among the catholic bishops; <CARDINAL>twenty-eight</CARDINAL> escaped by flight, and <CARDINAL>eighty-eight</CARDINAL> by conformity; <CARDINAL>forty-six</CARDINAL> were sent into <GPE>Corsica</GPE> to cut timber for the royal navy; and three hundred and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were banished to the different parts of Africa, exposed to the insults of their enemies, and carefully deprived of all the temporal and spiritual comforts of life.
 (95) The hardships of ten years' exile must have reduced their numbers; and if they had complied with the law of Thrasimund, which prohibited any episcopal consecrations, the orthodox church of <LOC>Africa</LOC> must have expired with the lives of its actual members.
 They disobeyed; and their disobedience was punished by a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> exile of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and twenty bishops into Sardinia, where they languished fifteen years, till the accession of the gracious Hilderic.
 (96) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> islands were judiciously chosen by the malice of their <NORP>Arian</NORP> tyrants.
 Seneca, from his own experience, has deplored and exaggerated the miserable state of Corsica, (97) and the plenty of <GPE>Sardinia</GPE> was overbalanced by the unwholesome quality of the air.
(98)III.
 The zeal of <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> and his successors for the conversion of the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> must have rendered them still more jealous to guard the purity of the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> faith.
 Before the churches were finally shut, it was a crime to appear in a barbarian dress; and those who presumed to neglect the royal mandate were rudely dragged backwards by their long hair.
 (99) The palatine officers, who refused to profess the religion of their prince, were ignominiously stripped of their honours and employments; banished to <GPE>Sardinia</GPE> and Sicily; or condemned to the servile labours of slaves and peasants in the fields of Utica.
 In the districts which had been peculiarly allotted to the Vandals, the exercise of the catholic worship was more strictly prohibited; and severe penalties were denounced against the guilt both of the missionary and the proselyte.
 By these arts the faith of the barbarians was preserved, and their zeal was inflamed: they discharged with devout fury the office of spies, informers, or executioners and whenever their cavalry took the field, it was the favourite amusement of the march to defile the churches and to insult the clergy of the adverse faction.
(100) IV.
 The citizens who had been educated in the luxury of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> province were delivered, with exquisite cruelty, to the <NORP>Moors</NORP> of the desert.
 A venerable train of bishops, presbyters, and deacons, with a faithful crowd of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand and ninety-six persons, whose guilt is not precisely ascertained, were torn from their native homes by the command of Hunneric.
 During the night they were confined, like a herd of cattle, amidst their own ordure: during the day they pursued their march over the burning sands; and if they fainted under the heat and fatigue, they were goaded or dragged along till they expired in the hands of their tormentors.
 (101) These unhappy exiles, when they reached the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> huts, might excite the compassion of a people whose native humanity was neither improved by reason nor corrupted by fanaticism: but if they escaped the dangers, they were condemned to share the distress, of a savage life.
 V.
 It is incumbent on the authors of persecution previously to reflect whether they are determined to support it in the last extreme.
 They excite the flame which they strive to extinguish; and it soon becomes necessary to chastise the contumacy, as well as the crime, of the offender.
 The fine, which he is unable or unwilling to discharge, exposes his person to the severity of the law; and his contempt of lighter penalties suggests the use and propriety of capital punishment.
 Through the veil of fiction and declamation we may clearly perceive that the Catholics, more especially under the reign of Hunneric, endured the most cruel and ignominious treatment.
 (102) Respectable citizens, noble matrons, and consecrated virgins were stripped naked and raised in the air by pulleys, with a weight suspended at their feet.
 In this painful attitude their naked bodies were torn with scourges, or burnt in the most tender parts with red-hot plates of iron.
 The amputation of the ears, the nose, the tongue, and the right hand was inflicted by the Arians; and although the precise number cannot be defined, it is evident that many persons, among whom a bishop, (103) and a roconsul, (104) may be named, were entitled to the crown of martyrdom.
 The same honour has been ascribed to the memory of Count Sebastian, who professed the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> creed with unshaken constancy; and <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> might detest as an heretic the brave and ambitious fugitive whom he dreaded as a rival.
(105) VI.
 A new mode of conversion, which might subdue the feeble and alarm the timorous, was employed by the <NORP>Arian</NORP> ministers.
 They imposed, by fraud or violence, the rites of baptism and punished the apostasy of the Catholics, if they disclaimed this odious and profane ceremony, which scandalously violated the freedom of the will and the unity of the sacrament.
 (106) The hostile sects had formerly allowed the validity of each other's baptism; and the innovation, so fiercely maintained by the Vandals, can be imputed only to the example and advice of the Donatists.
 VII.
 The <NORP>Arian</NORP> clergy surpassed in religious cruelty the king and his <NORP>Vandals</NORP> but they were incapable of cultivating the spiritual vineyard which they were so desirous to possess.
 A patriarch (107) might seat himself on the throne of Carthage; some bishops, in the principal cities, might usurp the place of their rivals; but the smallness of their numbers, and their ignorance of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> language, (108) disqualified the barbarians for the ecclesiastical ministry of a great church; and the Africans, after the loss of their orthodox pastors, were deprived of the public exercise of Christianity.
 VIII.
 The emperors were the natural protectors of the <NORP>Homoousian</NORP> doctrine; and the faithful people of Africa, both as Romans, and as Catholics, preferred their lawful sovereignty to the usurpation of the barbarous heretics.
 During an interval of peace and friendship <PERSON>Homeric</PERSON> restored the cathedral of Carthage, at the intercession of Zeno, who reigned in the East, and of Placidia, the daughter and relict of emperors and the sister of the queen of the Vandals.
 (109) But this decent regard was of short duration; and the haughty tyrant displayed his contempt for the religion of the empire by studiously arranging the bloody images of persecution in all the principal streets through which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador must pass in his way to the palace.
 (110) An oath was required from the bishops who were assembled at Carthage, that they would support the succession of his son Hilderic, and that they would renounce all foreign or transmarine correspondence.
 This engagement, consistent, as it should seem, with their moral and religious duties, was refused by the more sagacious members (111) of the assembly.
 Their refusal, faintly coloured by the pretence that it is unlawful for a <NORP>Christian</NORP> to swear, must provoke the suspicions of a jealous tyrant.
 <NORP>Catholic</NORP> frauds.
 The catholics, oppressed by royal and military force, were far superior to their adversaries in numbers and learning With the same weapons which the <NORP>Greek</NORP> (112) and <NORP>Latin</NORP> fathers had already provided for the <NORP>Arian</NORP> controversy, they repeatedly silenced or vanquished the fierce and illiterate successors of Ulphilas.
 The consciousness of their own superiority might have raised them above the arts and passions of religious warfare.
 Yet, instead of assuming such honourable pride, the orthodox theologians were tempted, by the assurance of impunity, to compose fictions which must be stigmatised with the epithets of fraud and forgery.
 They ascribed their own polemical works to the most venerable names of <NORP>Christian</NORP> antiquity; the characters of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Augustin</PERSON> were awkwardly personated by <PERSON>Vigilius</PERSON> and his disciples; (113) and the famous creed, which so clearly expounds the mysteries of the <ORG>Trinity</ORG> and the Incarnation, is deduced, with strong probability, from this <NORP>African</NORP> school.
 (114) Even the <WORK_OF_ART>Scriptures</WORK_OF_ART> themselves were profaned by their rash and sacrilegious hands.
 The memorable text which asserts the unity of the <CARDINAL>THREE</CARDINAL> who bear witness in heaven (115) is condemned by the universal silence of the orthodox fathers, ancient versions, and authentic manuscripts.
 (116) It was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> alleged by the catholic bishops whom <PERSON>Hunneric</PERSON> summoned to the conference of Carthage.
 (117) An allegorical interpretation, in the form perhaps of a marginal note, invaded the text of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Bibles which were renewed and corrected in a dark period of ten centuries.
 (118) After the invention of printing, (119) the editors of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> Testament yielded to their own prejudices, or those of the times; (120) and the pious fraud, which was embraced with equal zeal at <GPE>Rome</GPE> and at Geneva, has been infinitely multiplied in every country and every language of modern Europe.
 and miracles.
 The example of fraud must excite suspicion: and the specious miracles by which the <NORP>African</NORP> catholics have defended the truth and justice of their cause may described, with more reason, to their own industry than to the visible protection of Heaven.
 Yet the historian who views his religious conflict with an impartial eye may condescend to mention <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> preternatural event, which will edify the devout and surprise the incredulous.
 Tipasa, (121) a maritime colony of Mauritania, sixteen miles to the east of Caearea, had been distinguished in every age by the orthodox zeal of its inhabitants.
 They had braved the fury of the Donatists; (122) they resisted or eluded the tyranny of the Arians.
 The town was deserted on the approach of an heretical bishop; most of the inhabitants who could procure ships passed over to the coast of Spain; and the unhappy remnant, refusing all communion with the usurper, still presumed to hold their pious, but illegal, assemblies.
 Their disobedience exasperated the cruelty of Hunneric.
 A military count was despatched from <GPE>Carthage</GPE> to Tipasa: he collected the catholics in the Forum, and, in the presence of the whole province, deprived the guilty of their right hands and their tongues.
 But the holy confessors continued to speak without tongues; and this miracle is attested by Victor, an <NORP>African</NORP> bishop, who published an history of the persecution within <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the event.
 (123)At <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> we are astonished to find a cool, a learned, and unexceptionable witness, without interest, and without passion.
 <PERSON>Aeneas</PERSON> of Gaza, a <NORP>Platonic</NORP> philosopher, has accurately described his own observations on these <NORP>African</NORP> sufferers.
 The testimony of <PERSON>Aeneas</PERSON> of <GPE>Gaza</GPE> might be confirmed by the superfluous evidence of the emperor Justinian, in a perpetual edict; of Count Marcellinus, in his Chronicle of the times; and of pope <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the First, who had resided at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> as the minister of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 (125) They all lived within the compass of a century; and they all appeal to their personal knowledge or the public notoriety for the truth of a miracle which was repeated in several instances, displayed on the greatest theatre of the world, and submitted during a series of years to the calm examination of the senses.
 This supernatural gift of the <NORP>African</NORP> confessors, who spoke without tongues, will command the assent of those, and of those only, who already believe that their language was pure and orthodox.
 But the stubborn mind of an infidel is guarded by secret, incurable suspicion; and the Arian, or Socinian, who has seriously rejected the doctrine of the Trinity, will not be shaken by the most plausible evidence of an <NORP>Athanasian</NORP> miracle.
 The ruin of <NORP>Arianism</NORP> among the Barbarians, A.
D.
 500-700.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> and the <NORP>Ostrogoths</NORP> persevered in the profession of <NORP>Arianism</NORP> till the final ruin of the kingdoms which they had founded in <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Italy.
 The barbarians of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> submitted to the orthodox dominion of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> was restored to the catholic church by the voluntary conversion of the Visigoths.
 Revolt and martyrdom of Hermenegild.
in Spain, A.
D.
 577-584 This salutary revolution (126) was hastened by the example of a royal martyr, whom our calmer reason may style an ungrateful rebel.
 Leovigild, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> monarch of Spain, deserved the respect of his enemies and the love of his subjects: the catholics enjoyed a free toleration, and his <NORP>Arian</NORP> synods attempted, without much success, to reconcile their scruples by abolishing the unpopular rite of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> baptism.
 His eldest son Hermenegild, who was invested by his father with the royal diadem and the fair principality of Baetica, contracted an honourable and orthodox alliance with a <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> princess, the daughter of Sigebert, king of Austrasia, and of the famous Brunechild.
 The beauteous Ingundis, who was no more than thirteen years of age, was received, beloved, and persecuted in the <NORP>Arian</NORP> court of Toledo; and her religious constancy was alternately assaulted with blandishments and violence by Goisvintha, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> queen, who abused the double claim of maternal authority.
 (127) Incensed by her resistance, <PERSON>Goisvintha</PERSON> seized the catholic princess by her long hair, inhumanly dashed her against the ground, kicked her till she was covered with blood, and at last gave orders that she should be stripped and thrown into a basin or fish-pond.
 (128) Love and honour might excite <PERSON>Hermenegild</PERSON> to resent this injurious treatment of his bride; and he was gradually persuaded that <PERSON>Ingundis</PERSON> suffered for the cause of divine truth.
 Her tender complaints, and the weighty arguments of Leander, archbishop of Seville, accomplished his conversion; and the heir of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> monarchy was initiated in the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> faith by the solemn rites of confirmation.
 (129) The rash youth, inflamed by zeal, and perhaps by ambition, was tempted to violate the duties of a son and a subject; and the catholics of Spain, although they could not complain of persecution, applauded his pious rebellion against an heretical father.
 The civil war was protracted by the long and obstinate sieges of Merida, Cordova, and Seville, which had strenuously espoused the party of Hermenegild.
 He invited the orthodox barbarians, the Suevi, and the Franks, to the destruction of his native land: he solicited the dangerous aid of the Romans, who possessed <LOC>Africa</LOC> and a part of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> coast; and his holy ambassador, the archbishop Leander, effectually negotiated in person with the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 But the hopes of the catholics were crushed by the active diligence of a monarch who commanded the troops and treasures of Spain; and the guilty <PERSON>Hermenegild</PERSON> after his vain attempts to resist or to escape, was compelled to surrender himself into the hands of an incensed father.
 <PERSON>Leovigild</PERSON> was still mindful of that sacred character; and the rebel, despoiled of the regal ornaments, was still permitted, in a decent exile, to profess the catholic religion.
 His repeated and unsuccessful treasons at length provoked the indignation of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king; and the sentence of death, which he pronounced with apparent reluctance, was privately executed in the tower of Seville.
 The inflexible constancy with which he refused to accept the <NORP>Arian</NORP> communion, as the price of his safety, may excuse the honours that have been paid to the memory of St.
 Hermenegild.
 His wife and infant son were detained by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> in ignominious captivity; and this domestic misfortune tarnished the glories of Leovigild, and embittered the last moments of his life.
 Conversion of <PERSON>Recared</PERSON> and the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> of Spain, A.
D.
 586-589.
 His son and successor, Recared, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> catholic king of Spain, had imbibed the faith of his unfortunate brother, which he supported with more prudence and success.
 Instead of revolting against his father, <PERSON>Recared</PERSON> patiently expected the hour of his death.
 Instead of condemning his memory, he piously supposed that the dying monarch had abjured the errors of Arianism, and recommended to his son the conversion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation.
 To accomplish that salutary end, <PERSON>Recared</PERSON> convened an assembly of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> clergy and nobles, declared himself a catholic, and exhorted them to imitate the example of their prince.
 The laborious interpretation of doubtful texts, or the curious pursuit of metaphysical arguments, would have excited an endless controversy; and the monarch discreetly proposed to his illiterate audience <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> substantial and visible arguments - the testimony of <LOC>Earth</LOC> and of Heaven.
 The <LOC>Earth</LOC> had submitted to the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> synod: the Romans, the barbarians, and the inhabitants of <GPE>Spain</GPE> unanimously professed the same orthodox creed; and the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> resisted, almost alone, the consent of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world.
 A superstitious age was prepared to reverence, as the testimony of Heaven, the preternatural cures which were performed by the skill or virtue of the catholic clergy; the baptismal fonts of Osset in <GPE>Baetica</GPE> (130) which were spontaneously replenished each year on the vigil of Easter; (131) and the miraculous shrine of St.
 <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> of Tours, which had already converted the <NORP>Suevic</NORP> prince and people of Gallicia.
 (132) The catholic king encountered some difficulties on this important change of the national religion.
 A conspiracy, secretly fomented by the queen-dowager.
 was formed against his life; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> counts excited a dangerous revolt in the Narbonnese Gaul.
 But <PERSON>Recared</PERSON> disarmed the conspirators, defeated the rebels, and executed severe justice, which the Arians, in their turn, might brand with the reproach of persecution.
 <CARDINAL>Eight</CARDINAL> bishops, whose names betray their barbaric origin, abjured their errors; and all the books of <NORP>Arian</NORP> theology were reduced to ashes, with the house in which they had been purposely collected.
 The whole body of the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> and Suevi, were allured or driven into the pale of the catholic communion; the faith, at least of the rising generation, was fervent and sincere; and the devout liberality of the barbarians enriched the churches and monasteries of Spain.
 <CARDINAL>Seventy</CARDINAL> bishops, assembled in the council of Toledo, received the submission of their conquerors; and the zeal of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> improved the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> creed, by declaring the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son, as well as from the Father; a weighty point of doctrine, which produced, long afterwards, the schism of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Latin</NORP> churches.
 (133) The royal proselyte immediately saluted and consulted pope Gregory, surnamed the Great, a learned and holy prelate whose reign was distinguished by the conversion of heretics and infidels.
 The ambassadors of <PERSON>Recared</PERSON> respectfully offered on the threshold of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> his rich presents of gold and gems; they accepted, as a lucrative exchange, the hairs of St.
 John the Baptist; a cross which enclosed a small piece of the true wood; and a key that contained some particles of iron which had been scraped from the chains of St.
 Peter.
 (134) Conversion of the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> of Italy, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>600</CARDINAL> etc.
 The same Gregory, the spiritual conqueror of Britain, encouraged the pious Theodelinda, queen of the Lombards, to propagate the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> faith among the victorious savages, whose recent <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was polluted by the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Her devout labours still left room for the industry and success of future missionaries, and many cities of <GPE>Italy</GPE> were still disputed by hostile bishops.
 But the cause of <NORP>Arianism</NORP> was gradually suppressed by the weight of truth, of interest, and of example; and the controversy, which <GPE>Egypt</GPE> had derived from the <NORP>Platonic</NORP> school, was terminated, after a war of three hundred years, by the final conversion of the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> of Italy.
 (135) Persecution of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> in Spain, A.
D.
 612-712.
.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> missionaries who preached the <WORK_OF_ART>Gospel</WORK_OF_ART> to the barbarians appealed to the evidence of reason, and claimed the benefit of toleration.
 (136) But no sooner had they established their spiritual dominion than they exhorted the <NORP>Christian</NORP> kings to extirpate, without mercy, the remains of <NORP>Roman</NORP> or barbaric superstition.
 The successors of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> inflicted <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred lashes on the peasants who refused to destroy their idols; the crime of sacrificing to the demons was punished by the Anglo-Saxon laws with the heavier penalties of imprisonment and confiscation; and even the wise <PERSON>Alfred</PERSON> adopted, as an indispensable duty, the extreme rigour of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> institutions.
 (137) But the punishment and the crime were gradually abolished among a <NORP>Christian</NORP> people; the theological disputes of the schools were suspended by propitious ignorance; and the intolerant spirit which could find neither idolaters nor heretics, was reduced to the persecution of the Jews.
 That exiled nation had founded some synagogues in the cities of Gaul; but Spain, since the time of Hadrian, was filled with their numerous colonies.
 (138) The wealth which they accumulated by trade and the management of the finances invited the pious avarice of their masters; and they might be oppressed without danger, as they had lost the use, and even the remembrance, of arms.
 Sisebut, a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king who reigned in the beginning of the seventh century, proceeded at once to the last extremes of persecution.
 (139) Ninety thousand <NORP>Jews</NORP> were compelled to receive the sacrament of baptism; the fortunes of the obstinate infidels were confiscated, their bodies were tortured, and it seems doubtful whether they were permitted to abandon their native country.
 The excessive zeal of the catholic king was moderated even by the clergy of Spain, who solemnly pronounced an inconsistent sentence: that the sacraments should not be forcibly imposed; but that the <NORP>Jews</NORP> who had been baptised should be constrained, for the honour of the church, to persevere in the external practice of a religion which they disbelieved and detested.
 Their frequent relapses provoked <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the successors of <GPE>Sisebut</GPE> to banish the whole nation from his dominions; and a council of <GPE>Toledo</GPE> published a decree that every <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king should swear to maintain this salutary edict.
 But the tyrants were unwilling to dismiss the victims whom they delighted to torture, or to deprive themselves of the industrious slaves over whom they might exercise a lucrative oppression.
 The <NORP>Jews</NORP> still continued in Spain, under the weight of the civil and ecclesiastical laws, which in the same country have been faithfully transcribed in the Code of the <ORG>Inquisition</ORG> The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kings and bishops at length discovered that injuries will produce hatred, and that hatred will find the opportunity of revenge.
 A nation, the secret or professed enemies of Christianity, still multiplied in servitude and distress; and the intrigues of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> promoted the rapid success of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquerors.
 (140) Conclusion.
 As soon as the barbarians withdrew their powerful support, the unpopular heresy of <PERSON>Arius</PERSON> sunk into contempt and oblivion.
 But the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> still retained their subtle and loquacious disposition: the establishment of an obscure doctrine suggested new questions and new disputes; and it was always in the power of an ambitious prelate or a fanatic monk to violate the peace of the church, and perhaps of the empire.
 The historian of the empire may overlook those disputes which were confined to the obscurity of schools and synods.
 The Manichceans, who laboured to reconcile the religions of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and of Zoroaster, had secretly introduced themselves into the provinces: but these foreign sectaries were involved in the common disgrace of the Gnostics, and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> laws were executed by the public hatred.
 The rational opinions of the <NORP>Pelagians</NORP> were propagated from <GPE>Britain</GPE> to Rome, Africa, and Palestine, and silently expired in a superstitious age.
 But the <LOC>East</LOC> was distracted by the <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> and <NORP>Eutychian</NORP> controversies, which attempted to explain the mystery of the incarnation, and hastened the ruin of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> in her native land.
 These controversies were <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> agitated under the reign of the younger Theodosius: but their important consequences extend far beyond the limits of the present volume.
 The metaphysical chain of argument, the contests of ecclesiastical ambition, and their political influence on the decline of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire, may afford an interesting and instructive series of history, from the general councils of <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> and <GPE>Chalcedon</GPE> to the conquest of the <LOC>East</LOC> by the successors of Mahomet.
