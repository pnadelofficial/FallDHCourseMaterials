D.
 <CARDINAL>476-527</CARDINAL> After the fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> Empire in the West, an interval of fifty years, till the memorable reign of Justinian, is faintly marked by the obscure names and imperfect annals of Zeno, Anastasius, and Justin, who successively ascended to the throne of Constantinople.
 During the same period, <GPE>Italy</GPE> revived and flourished under the government of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who might have deserved a statue among the best and bravest of the ancient Romans.
 Birth and education of Theodoric, A.
D.
 455-475 <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> the Ostrogoth, the <ORDINAL>fourteenth</ORDINAL> in lineal descent of the royal line of the Amali, (1) was born in the neighborhood of <GPE>Vienna</GPE> (2) <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the death of Attila.
 A recent victory had restored the independence of the Ostrogoths; and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> brothers, Walamir, Theodemir, and Widimir, who ruled that warlike nation with united counsels, had separately pitched their habitations in the fertile though desolate province of Pannonia.
 The <NORP>Huns</NORP> still threatened their revolted subjects, but their hasty attack was repelled by the single forces of Walamir, and the news of his victory reached the distant camp of his brother in the same auspicious moment that the favorite concubine of <PERSON>Theodemir</PERSON> was delivered of a son and heir.
 In the eighth year of his age, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> was reluctantly yielded by his father to the public interest, as the pledge of an alliance which Leo, emperor of the East, had consented to purchase by an <DATE>annual</DATE> subsidy of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred pounds of gold.
 The royal hostage was educated at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with care and tenderness.
 His body was formed to all the exercises of war, his mind was expanded by the habits of liberal conversation; he frequented the schools of the most skilful masters; but he disdained or neglected the arts of Greece, and so ignorant did he always remain of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> elements of science, that a rude mark was contrived to represent the signature of the illiterate king of Italy.
 (3) As soon as he had attained the age of eighteen, he was restored to the wishes of the Ostrogoths, whom the emperor aspired to gain by liberality and confidence.
 <PERSON>Walamir</PERSON> had fallen in battle; the youngest of the brothers, Widimir, had led away into <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> an army of Barbarians, and the whole nation acknowledged for their king the father of Theodoric.
 His ferocious subjects admired the strength and stature of their young prince; (4) and he soon convinced them that he had not degenerated from the valor of his ancestors.
 At the head of six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> volunteers, he secretly left the camp in quest of adventures, descended the <LOC>Danube</LOC> as far as Singidunum, or Belgrade, and soon returned to his father with the spoils of a <NORP>Sarmatian</NORP> king whom he had vanquished and slain.
 Such triumphs, however, were productive only of fame, and the invincible <NORP>Ostrogoths</NORP> were reduced to extreme distress by the want of clothing and food.
 They unanimously resolved to desert their <NORP>Pannonian</NORP> encampments, and boldly to advance into the warm and wealthy neighborhood of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court, which already maintained in pride and luxury so many bands of confederate Goths.
 After proving, by some acts of hostility, that they could be dangerous, or at least troublesome, enemies, the <NORP>Ostrogoths</NORP> sold at a high price their reconciliation and fidelity, accepted a donative of lands and money, and were intrusted with the defence of the Lower Danube, under the command of Theodoric, who succeeded after his father's death to the hereditary throne of the Amali.
 (5) The reign of Zeno, A.
D.
 474-491, Feb.
 Apr.
 <CARDINAL>9</CARDINAL> A hero, descended from a race of kings, must have despised the base <NORP>Isaurian</NORP> who was invested with the <NORP>Roman</NORP> purple, without any endowment of mind or body, without any advantages of royal birth, or superior qualifications.
 After the failure of the <NORP>Theodosian</NORP> life, the choice of <PERSON>Pulcheria</PERSON> and of the senate might be justified in some measure by the characters of <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> and Leo, but the latter of these princes confirmed and dishonored his reign by the perfidious murder of <PERSON>Aspar</PERSON> and his sons, who too rigorously exacted the debt of gratitude and obedience.
 The inheritance of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> and of the <LOC>East</LOC> was peaceably devolved on his infant grandson, the son of his daughter Ariadne; and her <NORP>Isaurian</NORP> husband, the fortunate Trascalisseus, exchanged that barbarous sound for the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> appellation of Zeno.
 After the decease of the elder Leo, he approached with unnatural respect the throne of his son, humbly received, as a gift, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> rank in the empire, and soon excited the public suspicion on the sudden and premature death of his young colleague, whose life could no longer promote the success of his ambition.
 But the palace of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was ruled by female influence, and agitated by female passions: and Verina, the widow of Leo, claiming his empire as her own, pronounced a sentence of deposition against the worthless and ungrateful servant on whom she alone had bestowed the sceptre of the East.
 (6) As soon as she sounded a revolt in the ears of Zeno, he fled with precipitation into the mountains of Isauria, and her brother Basiliscus, already infamous by his <NORP>African</NORP> expedition, (7) was unanimously proclaimed by the servile senate.
 But the reign of the usurper was short and turbulent.
 <ORG>Basiliscus</ORG> presumed to assassinate the lover of his sister; he dared to offend the lover of his wife, the vain and insolent Harmatius, who, in the midst of <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> luxury, affected the dress, the demeanor, and the surname of Achilles.
 (8) By the conspiracy of the malecontents, <PERSON>Zeno</PERSON> was recalled from exile; the armies, the capital, the person, of Basiliscus, were betrayed; and his whole family was condemned to the long agony of cold and hunger by the inhuman conqueror, who wanted courage to encounter or to forgive his enemies.
 The haughty spirit of <PERSON>Verina</PERSON> was still incapable of submission or repose.
 She provoked the enmity of a favorite general, embraced his cause as soon as he was disgraced, created a new emperor in <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Egypt, raised an army of seventy <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men, and persisted to the last moment of her life in a fruitless rebellion, which, according to the fashion of the age, had been predicted by <NORP>Christian</NORP> hermits and <NORP>Pagan</NORP> magicians.
 While the <LOC>East</LOC> was afflicted by the passions of Verina, her daughter <PERSON>Ariadne</PERSON> was distinguished by the female virtues of mildness and fidelity; she followed her husband in his exile, and after his restoration, she implored his clemency in favor of her mother.

 July 8.
 On the decease of Zeno, Ariadne, the daughter, the mother, and the widow of an emperor, gave her hand and the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> title to Anastasius, an aged domestic of the palace, who survived his elevation above twenty-seven years, and whose character is attested by the acclamation of the people, "Reign as you have lived!" (9) Service and revolt of Theodoric, A.
D.
 475-488.
 Whatever fear of affection could bestow, was profusely lavished by <PERSON>Zeno</PERSON> on the king of the Ostrogoths; the rank of patrician and consul, the command of the <NORP>Palatine</NORP> troops, an equestrian statue, a treasure in gold and silver of many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds, the name of son, and the promise of a rich and honorable wife.
 As long as <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> condescended to serve, he supported with courage and fidelity the cause of his benefactor; his rapid march contributed to the restoration of Zeno; and in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> revolt, the Walamirs, as they were called, pursued and pressed the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> rebels, till they left an easy victory to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> troops.
 (10) But the faithful servant was suddenly converted into a formidable enemy, who spread the flames of war from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to the Adriatic; many flourishing cities were reduced to ashes, and the agriculture of <PERSON>Thrace</PERSON> was almost extirpated by the wanton cruelty of the Goths, who deprived their captive peasants of the right hand that guided the plough.
 (11) On such occasions, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> sustained the loud and specious reproach of disloyalty, of ingratitude, and of insatiate avarice, which could be only excused by the hard necessity of his situation.
 He reigned, not as the monarch, but as the minister of a ferocious people, whose spirit was unbroken by slavery, and impatient of real or imaginary insults.
 Their poverty was incurable; since the most liberal donatives were soon dissipated in wasteful luxury, and the most fertile estates became barren in their hands; they despised, but they envied, the laborious provincials; and when their subsistence had failed, the <NORP>Ostrogoths</NORP> embraced the familiar resources of war and rapine.
 It had been the wish of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> (such at least was his declaration) to lead a peaceful, obscure, obedient life on the confines of Scythia, till the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court, by splendid and fallacious promises, seduced him to attack a confederate tribe of Goths, who had been engaged in the party of Basiliscus.
 He marched from his station in Maesia, on the solemn assurance that before he reached Adrianople, he should meet a plentiful convoy of provisions, and a reinforcement of eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse and thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot, while the legions of <LOC>Asia</LOC> were encamped at <ORG>Heraclea</ORG> to <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> his operations.
 These measures were disappointed by mutual jealousy.
 As he advanced into Thrace, the son of <PERSON>Theodemir</PERSON> found an inhospitable solitude, and his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> followers, with a heavy train of horses, of mules, and of wagons, were betrayed by their guides among the rocks and precipices of Mount Sondis, where he was assaulted by the arms and invectives of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> the son of Triarius.
 From a neighboring height, his artful rival harangued the camp of the Walamirs, and branded their leader with the opprobrious names of child, of madman, of perjured traitor, the enemy of his blood and nation.
 A language so well suited to the temper of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> excited clamor and discontent; and the son of Theodemir, apprehensive of being left alone, was compelled to embrace his brethren, and to imitate the example of <NORP>Roman</NORP> perfidy.
 (12) He undertakes the conquest of Italy.
 A.
D.
 489.
 In every state of his fortune, the prudence and firmness of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> were equally conspicuous; whether he threatened <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> at the head of the confederate Goths, or retreated with a faithful band to the mountains and sea-coast of Epirus.
 At length the accidental death of the son of <PERSON>Triarius</PERSON> (13) destroyed the balance which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had been so anxious to preserve, the whole nation acknowledged the supremacy of the Amali, and the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court subscribed an ignominious and oppressive treaty.
 (14) The senate had already declared, that it was necessary to choose a party among the Goths, since the public was unequal to the support of their united forces; a subsidy of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, with the ample pay of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men, were required for the least considerable of their armies; (15) and the Isaurians, who guarded not the empire but the emperor, enjoyed, besides the privilege of rapine, an <DATE>annual</DATE> pension of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds.
 The sagacious mind of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> soon perceived that he was odious to the Romans, and suspected by the Barbarians: he understood the popular murmur, that his subjects were exposed in their frozen huts to intolerable hardships, while their king was dissolved in the luxury of Greece, and he prevented the painful alternative of encountering the Goths, as the champion, or of leading them to the field, as the enemy, of Zeno.
 Embracing an enterprise worthy of his courage and ambition, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> addressed the emperor in the following words: The proposal of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> was accepted, and perhaps had been suggested, by the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 But the forms of the commission, or grant, appear to have been expressed with a prudent ambiguity, which might be explained by the event; and it was left doubtful, whether the conqueror of <GPE>Italy</GPE> should reign as the lieutenant, the vassal, or the ally, of the emperor of the East.
 (16)His march.
 The reputation both of the leader and of the war diffused a universal ardor; the <NORP>Walamirs</NORP> were multiplied by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> swarms already engaged in the service, or seated in the provinces, of the empire; and each bold Barbarian, who had heard of the wealth and beauty of Italy, was impatient to seek, through the most perilous adventures, the possession of such enchanting objects.
 The march of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> must be considered as the emigration of an entire people; the wives and children of the Goths, their aged parents, and most precious effects, were carefully transported; and some idea may be formed of the heavy baggage that now followed the camp, by the loss of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> wagons, which had been sustained in a single action in the war of Epirus.
 For their subsistence, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> depended on the magazines of corn which was ground in portable mills by the hands of their women; on the milk and flesh of their flocks and herds; on the casual produce of the chase, and upon the contributions which they might impose on all who should presume to dispute the passage, or to refuse their friendly assistance.
 Notwithstanding these precautions, they were exposed to the danger, and almost to the distress, of famine, in a march of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred miles, which had been undertaken in the depth of a rigorous winter.
 Since the fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> power, <GPE>Dacia</GPE> and <GPE>Pannonia</GPE> no longer exhibited the rich prospect of populous cities, well-cultivated fields, and convenient highways: the reign of barbarism and desolation was restored, and the tribes of Bulgarians, Gepidae, and Sarmatians, who had occupied the vacant province, were prompted by their native fierceness, or the solicitations of Odoacer, to resist the progress of his enemy.
 In many obscure though bloody battles, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> fought and vanquished; till at length, surmounting every obstacle by skilful conduct and persevering courage, he descended from the Julian Alps, and displayed his invincible banners on the confines of Italy.
 (17) The <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> defeats of Odoacer, A.
D.
 489, <DATE>August</DATE> 28, Sept.
27; A.
D.
 490, August.
 Odoacer, a rival not unworthy of his arms, had already occupied the advantageous and well-known post of the River Sontius, near the ruins of Aquileia, at the head of a powerful host, whose independent kings (18) or leaders disdained the duties of subordination and the prudence of delays.
 No sooner had <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> gained a short repose and refreshment to his wearied cavalry, than he boldly attacked the fortifications of the enemy; the <NORP>Ostrogoths</NORP> showed more ardor to acquire, than the mercenaries to defend, the lands of Italy; and the reward of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> victory was the possession of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> province as far as the walls of Verona.
 In the neighborhood of that city, on the steep banks of the rapid Adige, he was opposed by a new army, reenforced in its numbers, and not impaired in its courage: the contest was more obstinate, but the event was still more decisive; <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> fled to Ravenna, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> advanced to Milan, and the vanquished troops saluted their conqueror with loud acclamations of respect and fidelity.
 But their want either of constancy or of faith soon exposed him to the most imminent danger; his vanguard, with several <NORP>Gothic</NORP> counts, which had been rashly intrusted to a deserter, was betrayed and destroyed near <PERSON>Faenza</PERSON> by his double treachery; <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> again appeared master of the field, and the invader, strongly intrenched in his camp of Pavia, was reduced to solicit the aid of a kindred nation, the <PERSON>Visigoths</PERSON> of Gaul.
 In the course of this History, the most voracious appetite for war will be abundantly satiated; nor can I much lament that our dark and imperfect materials do not afford a more ample narrative of the distress of Italy, and of the fierce conflict, which was finally decided by the abilities, experience, and valor of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king.
 Immediately before the battle of Verona, he visited the tent of his mother (19) and sister, and requested, that on a day, the most illustrious festival of his life, they would adorn him with the rich garments which they had worked with their own hands.
 The wife or concubine of <PERSON>Theodemir</PERSON> was inspired with the spirit of the <NORP>German</NORP> matrons, who esteemed their sons' honor far above their safety; and it is reported, that in a desperate action, when <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> himself was hurried along by the torrent of a flying crowd, she boldly met them at the entrance of the camp, and, by her generous reproaches, drove them back on the swords of the enemy.
 (20) his capitulation and death, A.
D.
 493, March 5.
 From the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to the extremity of Calabria, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> reigned by the right of conquest; the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> ambassadors surrendered the Island of Sicily, as a lawful appendage of his kingdom; and he was accepted as the deliverer of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the senate and people, who had shut their gates against the flying usurper.
 (21) <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> alone, secure in the fortifications of art and nature, still sustained a siege of almost <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years; and the daring sallies of <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> carried slaughter and dismay into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 At length, destitute of provisions and hopeless of relief, that unfortunate monarch yielded to the groans of his subjects and the clamors of his soldiers.
 A treaty of peace was negotiated by the bishop of Ravenna; the <NORP>Ostrogoths</NORP> were admitted into the city, and the hostile kings consented, under the sanction of an oath, to rule with equal and undivided authority the provinces of Italy.
 The event of such an agreement may be easily foreseen.
 After some days had been devoted to the semblance of joy and friendship, Odoacer, in the midst of a solemn banquet, was stabbed by the hand, or at least by the command, of his rival.
 Secret and effectual orders had been previously despatched; the faithless and rapacious mercenaries, at the same moment, and without resistance, were universally massacred; and the royalty of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> was proclaimed by the Goths, with the tardy, reluctant, ambiguous consent of the emperor of the East.
 The design of a conspiracy was imputed, according to the usual forms, to the prostrate tyrant; but his innocence, and the guilt of his conqueror, (22) are sufficiently proved by the advantageous treaty which force would not sincerely have granted, nor weakness have rashly infringed.
 The jealousy of power, and the mischiefs of discord, may suggest a more decent apology, and a sentence less rigorous may be pronounced against a crime which was necessary to introduce into <GPE>Italy</GPE> a generation of public felicity.
 Reign of Theodoric, king of Italy, A.
D.
 493, March 5- A.
D.
 526, <DATE>August</DATE> 30.
 The living author of this felicity was audaciously praised in his own presence by sacred and profane orators; (23) but history (in his time she was mute and inglorious) has not left any just representation of the events which displayed, or of the defects which clouded, the virtues of Theodoric.
 (24) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> record of his fame, the volume of public epistles composed by <PERSON>Cassiodorus</PERSON> in the royal name, is still extant, and has obtained more implicit credit than it seems to deserve.
 (25) They exhibit the forms, rather than the substance, of his government; and we should vainly search for the pure and spontaneous sentiments of the <PERSON>Barbarian</PERSON> amidst the declamation and learning of a sophist, the wishes of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> senator, the precedents of office, and the vague professions, which, in every court, and on every occasion, compose the language of discreet ministers.
 The reputation of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> may repose with more confidence on the visible peace and prosperity of a reign of thirty-three years; the unanimous esteem of his own times, and the memory of his wisdom and courage, his justice and humanity, which was deeply impressed on the minds of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Italians.
 Partion of lands.
 The partition of the lands of Italy, of which <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> assigned the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> part to his soldiers, is honourably arraigned as the sole injustice of his life.
 And even this act may be fairly justified by the example of Odoacer, the rights of conquest, the true interest of the Italians, and the sacred duty of subsisting a whole people, who, on the faith of his promises, had transported themselves into a distant land.
 (26) Under the reign of Theodoric, and in the happy climate of Italy, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> soon multiplied to a formidable host of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men, (27) and the whole amount of their families may be computed by the ordinary addition of women and children.
 Their invasion of property, a part of which must have been already vacant, was disguised by the generous but improper name of hospitality; these unwelcome guests were irregularly dispersed over the face of Italy, and the lot of each <PERSON>Barbarian</PERSON> was adequate to his birth and office, the number of his followers, and the rustic wealth which he possessed in slaves and cattle.
 The distinction of noble and plebeian were acknowledged; (28) but the lands of every freeman were exempt from taxes, and he enjoyed the inestimable privilege of being subject only to the laws of his country.
 (29) Fashion, and even convenience, soon persuaded the conquerors to assume the more elegant dress of the natives, but they still persisted in the use of their mother- tongue; and their contempt for the <NORP>Latin</NORP> schools was applauded by <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> himself, who gratified their prejudices, or his own, by declaring, that the child who had trembled at a rod, would never dare to look upon a sword.
 (30) Distress might sometimes provoke the indigent <NORP>Roman</NORP> to assume the ferocious manners which were insensibly relinquished by the rich and luxurious Barbarian: (31) but these mutual conversions were not encouraged by the policy of a monarch Separations of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Italians.
 who perpetuated the separation of the <NORP>Italians</NORP> and Goths; reserving the former for the arts of peace, and the latter for the service of war.
 To accomplish this design, he studied to protect his industrious subjects, and to moderate the violence, without enervating the valor, of his soldiers, who were maintained for the public defence.
 They held their lands and benefices as a military stipend: at the sound of the trumpet, they were prepared to march under the conduct of their provincial officers; and the whole extent of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was distributed into the several quarters of a well- regulated camp.
 The service of the palace and of the frontiers was performed by choice or by rotation; and each extraordinary fatigue was recompensed by an increase of pay and occasional donatives.
 <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> had convinced his brave companions, that empire must be acquired and defended by the same arts.
 After his example, they strove to excel in the use, not only of the lance and sword, the instruments of their victories, but of the missile weapons, which they were too much inclined to neglect; and the lively image of war was displayed in the daily exercise and <DATE>annual</DATE> reviews of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry.
 A firm though gentle discipline imposed the habits of modesty, obedience, and temperance; and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were instructed to spare the people, to reverence the laws, to understand the duties of civil society, and to disclaim the barbarous license of judicial combat and private revenge.
 (32) Foreign policy of Theodoric.
 Among the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of the West, the victory of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> had spread a general alarm.
 But as soon as it appeared that he was satisfied with conquest and desirous of peace, terror was changed into respect, and they submitted to a powerful mediation, which was uniformly employed for the best purposes of reconciling their quarrels and civilizing their manners.
 (33) The ambassadors who resorted to <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> from the most distant countries of Europe, admired his wisdom, magnificence, (34) and courtesy; and if he sometimes accepted either slaves or arms, white horses or strange animals, the gift of a sun-dial, a water-clock, or a musician, admonished even the princes of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> of the superior art and industry of his <NORP>Italian</NORP> subjects.
 His domestic alliances, (35) a wife, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> daughters, a sister, and a niece, united the family of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> with the kings of the Franks, the Burgundians, the Visigoths, the Vandals, and the Thuringians, and contributed to maintain the harmony, or at least the balance, of the great republic of the West.
 (36) It is difficult in the dark forests of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and <GPE>Poland</GPE> to pursue the emigrations of the Heruli, a fierce people who disdained the use of armor, and who condemned their widows and aged parents not to survive the loss of their husbands, or the decay of their strength.
 (37) The king of these savage warriors solicited the friendship of Theodoric, and was elevated to the rank of his son, according to the barbaric rites of a military adoption.
 (38) From the shores of the Baltic, the <NORP>Aestians</NORP> or <NORP>Livonians</NORP> laid their offerings of native amber (39) at the feet of a prince, whose fame had excited them to undertake an unknown and dangerous journey of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 With the country (40) from whence the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation derived their origin, he maintained a frequent and friendly correspondence: the <NORP>Italians</NORP> were clothed in the rich sables (41) of Sweden; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of its sovereigns, after a voluntary or reluctant abdication, found a hospitable retreat in the palace of Ravenna.
 He had reigned over <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> populous tribes who cultivated a small portion of the great island or peninsula of Scandinavia, to which the vague appellation of <PRODUCT>Thule</PRODUCT> has been sometimes applied.
 That northern region was peopled, or had been explored, as high as the sixty- eighth degree of latitude, where the natives of the polar circle enjoy and lose the presence of the sun at each summer and <DATE>winter</DATE> solstice during an equal period of forty days.
 (42) The long <TIME>night</TIME> of his absence or death was the mournful season of distress and anxiety, till the messengers, who had been sent to the mountain tops, descried the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rays of returning light, and proclaimed to the plain below the festival of his resurrection.
 (43) His defensive wars.
 The life of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> represents the rare and meritorious example of a Barbarian, who sheathed his sword in the pride of victory and the vigor of his age.
 A reign of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> and thirty years was consecrated to the duties of civil government, and the hostilities, in which he was sometimes involved, were speedily terminated by the conduct of his lieutenants, the discipline of his troops, the arms of his allies, and even by the terror of his name.
 He reduced, under a strong and regular government, the unprofitable countries of Rhaetia, Noricum, Dalmatia, and Pannonia, from the source of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the territory of the Bavarians, (44) to the petty kingdom erected by the <GPE>Gepidae</GPE> on the ruins of Sirmium.
 His prudence could not safely intrust the bulwark of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to such feeble and turbulent neighbors; and his justice might claim the lands which they oppressed, either as a part of his kingdom, or as the inheritance of his father.
 The greatness of a servant, who was named perfidious because he was successful, awakened the jealousy of the emperor Anastasius; and a war was kindled on the <NORP>Dacian</NORP> frontier, by the protection which the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, in the vicissitude of human affairs, had granted to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the descendants of Attila.
 Sabinian, a general illustrious by his own and father's merit, advanced at the head of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Romans; and the provisions and arms, which filled a long train of wagons, were distributed to the fiercest of the <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> tribes.
 But in the fields of Margus, the eastern powers were defeated by the inferior forces of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns; the flower and even the hope of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies was irretrievably destroyed; and such was the temperance with which <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> had inspired his victorious troops, that, as their leader had not given the signal of pillage, the rich spoils of the enemy lay untouched at their feet.
 (45) Exasperated by this disgrace, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court despatched <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred ships and eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men to plunder the sea-coast of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> and Apulia: they assaulted the ancient city of Tarentum, interrupted the trade and agriculture of a happy country, and sailed back to the Hellespont, proud of their piratical victory over a people whom they still presumed to consider as their <NORP>Roman</NORP> brethren.
 (46) Their retreat was possibly hastened by the activity of Theodoric; His naval armanent, A.
D.
 509.
 <GPE>Italy</GPE> was covered by a fleet of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> light vessels, (47) which he constructed with incredible despatch; and his firm moderation was soon rewarded by a solid and honorable peace.
 He maintained, with a powerful hand, the balance of the West, till it was at length overthrown by the ambition of Clovis; and although unable to assist his rash and unfortunate kinsman, the king of the Visigoths, he saved the remains of his family and people, and checked the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> in the midst of their victorious career.
 I am not desirous to prolong or repeat (48) this narrative of military events, the least interesting of the reign of Theodoric; and shall be content to add, that the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> were protected, (49) that an inroad of the <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> was severely chastised, and that the conquest of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and <GPE>Marseilles</GPE> opened a free communication with the Visigoths, who revered him as their national protector, and as the guardian of his grandchild, the infant son of Alaric.
 Under this respectable character, the king of <GPE>Italy</GPE> restored the praetorian praefecture of the Gauls, reformed some abuses in the civil government of Spain, and accepted the <DATE>annual</DATE> tribute and apparent submission of its military governor, who wisely refused to trust his person in the palace of Ravenna.
 (50) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sovereignty was established from <GPE>Sicily</GPE> to the Danube, from <LOC>Sirmium</LOC> or <GPE>Belgrade</GPE> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> themselves have acknowledged that <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> reigned over the fairest portion of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 (51) Civil government of <GPE>Italy</GPE> according to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> laws.
.
 The union of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have fixed for ages the transient happiness of Italy; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of nations, a new people of free subjects and enlightened soldiers, might have gradually arisen from the mutual emulation of their respective virtues.
 But the sublime merit of guiding or seconding such a revolution was not reserved for the reign of Theodoric: he wanted either the genius or the opportunities of a legislator; (52) and while he indulged the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in the enjoyment of rude liberty, he servilely copied the institutions, and even the abuses, of the political system which had been framed by <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and his successors.
 From a tender regard to the expiring prejudices of Rome, the <PERSON>Barbarian</PERSON> declined the name, the purple, and the diadem, of the emperors; but he assumed, under the hereditary title of king, the whole substance and plenitude of <ORG>Imperial</ORG> prerogative.
 (53) His addresses to the eastern throne were respectful and ambiguous: he celebrated, in pompous style, the harmony of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> republics, applauded his own government as the perfect similitude of a sole and undivided empire, and claimed above the kings of the earth the same preeminence which he modestly allowed to the person or rank of Anastasius.
 The alliance of the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> was annually declared by the unanimous choice of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> consuls; but it should seem that the <NORP>Italian</NORP> candidate who was named by <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> accepted a formal confirmation from the sovereign of Constantinople.
 (54) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> reflected the image of the court of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> or Valentinian.
 The <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, the praefect of Rome, the quaestor, the master of the offices, with the public and patrimonial treasurers, whose functions are painted in gaudy colours by the rhetoric of Cassiodorus, still continued to act as the ministers of state.
 And the subordinate care of justice and the revenue was delegated to <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> consulars, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> correctors, and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> presidents, who governed the <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> regions of <GPE>Italy</GPE> according to the principles, and even the forms, of <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence.
 (55) The violence of the conquerors was abated or eluded by the slow artifice of judicial proceedings; the civil administration, with its honors and emoluments, was confined to the Italians; and the people still preserved their dress and language, their laws and customs, their personal freedom, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thirds of their landed property.
 It had been the object of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to conceal the introduction of monarchy; it was the policy of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> to disguise the reign of a Barbarian.
 (56) If his subjects were sometimes awakened from this pleasing vision of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> government, they derived more substantial comfort from the character of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince, who had penetration to discern, and firmness to pursue, his own and the public interest.
 <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> loved the virtues which he possessed, and the talents of which he was destitute.
 <PERSON>Liberius</PERSON> was promoted to the office of <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect for his unshaken fidelity to the unfortunate cause of Odoacer.
 The ministers of Theodoric, Cassiodorus, (57) and Boethius, have reflected on his reign the lustre of their genius and learning.
 More prudent or more fortunate than his colleague, <PERSON>Cassiodorus</PERSON> preserved his own esteem without forfeiting the royal favor; and after passing thirty years in the honors of the world, he was blessed with an equal term of repose in the devout and studious solitude of Squillace.
 Prosperity of Rome.
 As the patron of the republic, it was the interest and duty of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king to cultivate the affections of the senate (58) and people.
 The nobles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were flattered by sonorous epithets and formal professions of respect, which had been more justly applied to the merit and authority of their ancestors.
 The people enjoyed, without fear or danger, the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> blessings of a capital, order, plenty, and public amusements.
 A visible diminution of their numbers may be found even in the measure of liberality; (59) yet Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, poured their tribute of corn into the granaries of <GPE>Rome</GPE> an allowance of bread and meat was distributed to the indigent citizens; and every office was deemed honorable which was consecrated to the care of their health and happiness.
 The public games, such as the <NORP>Greek</NORP> ambassador might politely applaud, exhibited a faint and feeble copy of the magnificence of the Caesars: yet the musical, the gymnastic, and the pantomime arts, had not totally sunk in oblivion; the wild beasts of <LOC>Africa</LOC> still exercised in the amphitheatre the courage and dexterity of the hunters; and the indulgent <NORP>Goth</NORP> either patiently tolerated or gently restrained the blue and green factions, whose contests so often filled the circus with clamor and even with blood.
 (60) In the seventh year of his peaceful reign, Visit of Theodoric, A.
D.
 500.
 <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> visited the old capital of the world; the senate and people advanced in solemn procession to salute a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Trajan, a new Valentinian; and he nobly supported that character by the assurance of a just and legal government, (61) in a discourse which he was not afraid to pronounce in public, and to inscribe on a tablet of brass.
 Rome, in this august ceremony, shot a last ray of declining glory; and a saint, the spectator of this pompous scene, could only hope, in his pious fancy, that it was excelled by the celestial splendor of the new Jerusalem.
 (62) During a residence of six months, the fame, the person, and the courteous demeanor of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, excited the admiration of the Romans, and he contemplated, with equal curiosity and surprise, the monuments that remained of their ancient greatness.
 He imprinted the footsteps of a conqueror on the Capitoline hill, and frankly confessed that each day he viewed with fresh wonder the forum of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> and his lofty column.
 The theatre of <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> appeared, even in its decay, as a huge mountain artificially hollowed, and polished, and adorned by human industry; and he vaguely computed, that a river of gold must have been drained to erect the colossal amphitheatre of Titus.
 (63) From the mouths of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> aqueducts, a pure and copious stream was diffused into every part of the city; among these the <NORP>Claudian</NORP> water, which arose at the distance of thirty-eight miles in the Sabine mountains, was conveyed along a gentle though constant declivity of solid arches, till it descended on the summit of the Aventine hill.
 The long and spacious vaults which had been constructed for the purpose of common sewers, subsisted, after <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> centuries, in their pristine strength; and these subterraneous channels have been preferred to all the visible wonders of Rome.
 (64) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kings, so injuriously accused of the ruin of antiquity, were anxious to preserve the monuments of the nation whom they had subdued.
 (65) The royal edicts were framed to prevent the abuses, the neglect, or the depredations of the citizens themselves; and a professed architect, the <DATE>annual</DATE> sum of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred pounds of gold, twenty-five <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> tiles, and the receipt of customs from the <GPE>Lucrine</GPE> port, were assigned for the ordinary repairs of the walls and public edifices.
 A similar care was extended to the statues of metal or marble of men or animals.
 The spirit of the horses, which have given a modern name to the Quirinal, was applauded by the Barbarians; (66) the brazen elephants of the Via sacra were diligently restored; (67) the famous heifer of <PERSON>Myron</PERSON> deceived the cattle, as they were driven through the forum of peace; (68) and an officer was created to protect those works of rat, which <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> considered as the noblest ornament of his kingdom.
 Flourishing state of Italy.
 After the example of the last emperors, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> preferred the residence of Ravenna, where he cultivated an orchard with his own hands.
 (69) As often as the peace of his kingdom was threatened (for it was never invaded) by the Barbarians, he removed his court to <GPE>Verona</GPE> (70) on the northern frontier, and the image of his palace, still extant on a coin, represents the oldest and most authentic model of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> architecture.
 These <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> capitals, as well as Pavia, Spoleto, Naples, and the rest of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> cities, acquired under his reign the useful or splendid decorations of churches, aqueducts, baths, porticos, and palaces.
 (71) But the happiness of the subject was more truly conspicuous in the busy scene of labor and luxury, in the rapid increase and bold enjoyment of national wealth.
 From the shades of <GPE>Tibur</GPE> and Praeneste, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators still retired in the <DATE>winter</DATE> season to the warm sun, and salubrious springs of Baiae; and their villas, which advanced on solid moles into the Bay of Naples, commanded the various prospect of the sky, the earth, and the water.
 On the eastern side of the Adriatic, a new <GPE>Campania</GPE> was formed in the fair and fruitful province of Istria, which communicated with the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> by an easy navigation of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred miles.
 The rich productions of <LOC>Lucania</LOC> and the adjacent provinces were exchanged at the <NORP>Marcilian</NORP> fountain, in a populous fair annually dedicated to trade, intemperance, and superstition.
 In the solitude of Comum, which had once been animated by the mild genius of Pliny, a transparent basin above sixty miles in length still reflected the rural seats which encompassed the margin of the Larian lake; and the gradual ascent of the hills was covered by a triple plantation of olives, of vines, and of chestnut trees.
 (72) Agriculture revived under the shadow of peace, and the number of husbandmen was multiplied by the redemption of captives.
 (73) The iron mines of Dalmatia, a gold mine in Bruttium, were carefully explored, and the Pomptine marshes, as well as those of Spoleto, were drained and cultivated by private undertakers, whose distant reward must depend on the continuance of the public prosperity.
 (74) Whenever the seasons were less propitious, the doubtful precautions of forming magazines of corn, fixing the price, and prohibiting the exportation, attested at least the benevolence of the state; but such was the extraordinary plenty which an industrious people produced from a grateful soil, that a <QUANTITY>gallon</QUANTITY> of wine was sometimes sold in <GPE>Italy</GPE> for less than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> farthings, and a <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of wheat at about <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> shillings and sixpence.
 (75) A country possessed of so many valuable objects of exchange soon attracted the merchants of the world, whose beneficial traffic was encouraged and protected by the liberal spirit of Theodoric.
 The free intercourse of the provinces by land and water was restored and extended; the city gates were never shut either by day or by night; and the common saying, that a purse of gold might be safely left in the fields, was expressive of the conscious security of the inhabitants.
 <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> an Arian.
 A difference of religion is always pernicious, and often fatal, to the harmony of the prince and people: the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror had been educated in the profession of Arianism, and <GPE>Italy</GPE> was devoutly attached to the <NORP>Nicene</NORP> faith.
 But the persuasion of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> was not infected by zeal; and he piously adhered to the heresy of his fathers, without condescending to balance the subtile arguments of theological metaphysics.
 Satisfied with the private toleration of his <NORP>Arian</NORP> sectaries, he justly conceived himself to be the guardian of the public worship, and his external reverence for a superstition which he despised, may have nourished in his mind the salutary indifference of a statesman or philosopher.
 His toleration of the Catholics.
 The <NORP>Catholics</NORP> of his dominions acknowledged, perhaps with reluctance, the peace of the church; their clergy, according to the degrees of rank or merit, were honorably entertained in the palace of Theodoric; he esteemed the living sanctity of <PERSON>Caesarius</PERSON> (76) and Epiphanius, (77) the orthodox bishops of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and Pavia; and presented a decent offering on the tomb of St.
 Peter, without any scrupulous inquiry into the creed of the apostle.
 (78) His favorite Goths, and even his mother, were permitted to retain or embrace the <NORP>Athanasian</NORP> faith, and his long reign could not afford the example of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> Catholic, who, either from choice or compulsion, had deviated into the religion of the conqueror.
 (79) The people, and the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> themselves, were edified by the pomp and order of religious worship; the magistrates were instructed to defend the just immunities of ecclesiastical persons and possessions; the bishops held their synods, the metropolitans exercised their jurisdiction, and the privileges of sanctuary were maintained or moderated according to the spirit of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence.
 (80) With the protection, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> assumed the legal supremacy, of the church; and his firm administration restored or extended some useful prerogatives which had been neglected by the feeble emperors of the West.
 He was not ignorant of the dignity and importance of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, to whom the venerable name of <ORG>POPE</ORG> was now appropriated.
 The peace or the revolt of <GPE>Italy</GPE> might depend on the character of a wealthy and popular bishop, who claimed such ample dominion both in heaven and earth; who had been declared in a numerous synod to be pure from all sin, and exempt from all judgment.
 (81) When the chair of St.
 Peter was disputed by <PERSON>Symmachus</PERSON> and Laurence, they appeared at his summons before the tribunal of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> monarch, and he confirmed the election of the most worthy or the most obsequious candidate.
 At the end of his life, in a moment of jealousy and resentment, he prevented the choice of the Romans, by nominating a pope in the palace of Ravenna.
 The danger and furious contests of a schism were mildly restrained, and the last decree of the senate was enacted to extinguish, if it were possible, the scandalous venality of the papal elections.
 (82) Vices of his government.
 I have descanted with pleasure on the fortunate condition of Italy; but our fancy must not hastily conceive that the golden age of the poets, a race of men without vice or misery, was realized under the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conquest.
 The fair prospect was sometimes overcast with clouds; the wisdom of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> might be deceived, his power might be resisted and the declining age of the monarch was sullied with popular hatred and patrician blood.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> insolence of victory, he had been tempted to deprive the whole party of <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> of the civil and even the natural rights of society; (83) a tax unseasonably imposed after the calamities of war, would have crushed the rising agriculture of Liguria; a rigid preemption of corn, which was intended for the public relief, must have aggravated the distress of Campania.
 These dangerous projects were defeated by the virtue and eloquence of <PERSON>Epiphanius</PERSON> and Boethius, who, in the presence of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> himself, successfully pleaded the cause of the people: (84) but if the royal ear was open to the voice of truth, a saint and a philosopher are not always to be found at the ear of kings.
 The privileges of rank, or office, or favor, were too frequently abused by <NORP>Italian</NORP> fraud and <NORP>Gothic</NORP> violence, and the avarice of the king's nephew was publicly exposed, at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> by the usurpation, and afterwards by the restitution of the estates which he had unjustly extorted from his <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> neighbors.
 Two hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Barbarians, formidable even to their master, were seated in the heart of Italy; they indignantly supported the restraints of peace and discipline; the disorders of their march were always felt and sometimes compensated; and where it was dangerous to punish, it might be prudent to dissemble, the sallies of their native fierceness.
 When the indulgence of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> had remitted <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thirds of the <NORP>Ligurian</NORP> tribute, he condescended to explain the difficulties of his situation, and to lament the heavy though inevitable burdens which he imposed on his subjects for their own defence.
 (85) These ungrateful subjects could never be cordially reconciled to the origin, the religion, or even the virtues of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror; past calamities were forgotten, and the sense or suspicion of injuries was rendered still more exquisite by the present felicity of the times.
 He is provoked to persecute the Catholics.
 Even the religious toleration which <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> had the glory of introducing into the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world, was painful and offensive to the orthodox zeal of the Italians.
 They respected the armed heresy of the Goths; but their pious rage was safely pointed against the rich and defenceless Jews, who had formed their establishments at Naples, Rome, Ravenna, Milan, and Genoa, for the benefit of trade, and under the sanction of the laws.
 (86) Their persons were insulted, their effects were pillaged, and their synagogues were burned by the mad populace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, inflamed, as it should seem, by the most frivolous or extravagant pretences.
 The government which could neglect, would have deserved such an outrage.
 A legal inquiry was instantly directed; and as the authors of the tumult had escaped in the crowd, the whole community was condemned to repair the damage; and the obstinate bigots, who refused their contributions, were whipped through the streets by the hand of the executioner.
 This simple act of justice exasperated the discontent of the Catholics, who applauded the merit and patience of these holy confessors.
 Three hundred pulpits deplored the persecution of the church; and if the chapel of St.
 Stephen at <GPE>Verona</GPE> was demolished by the command of Theodoric, it is probable that some miracle hostile to his name and dignity had been performed on that sacred theatre.
 At the close of a glorious life, the king of <GPE>Italy</GPE> discovered that he had excited the hatred of a people whose happiness he had so assiduously laboured to promote; and his mind was soured by indignation, jealousy, and the bitterness of unrequited love.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror condescended to disarm the unwarlike natives of Italy, interdicting all weapons of offence, and excepting only a small knife for domestic use.
 The deliverer of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was accused of conspiring with the vilest informers against the lives of senators whom he suspected of a secret and treasonable correspondence with the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (87) After the death of Anastasius, the diadem had been placed on the head of a feeble old man; but the powers of government were assumed by his nephew Justinian, who already meditated the extirpation of heresy, and the conquest of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Africa.
 A rigorous law, which was published at Constantinople, to reduce the <NORP>Arians</NORP> by the dread of punishment within the pale of the church, awakened the just resentment of Theodoric, who claimed for his distressed brethren of the <LOC>East</LOC> the same indulgence which he had so long granted to the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> of his dominions.
 At his stern command, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> illustrious senators, embarked on an embassy, of which he must have alike dreaded the failure or the success.
 The singular veneration shown to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> pope who had visited <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was punished as a crime by his jealous monarch; the artful or peremptory refusal of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court might excuse an equal, and would provoke a larger, measure of retaliation; and a mandate was prepared in Italy, to prohibit, after a stated day, the exercise of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> worship.
 By the bigotry of his subjects and enemies, the most tolerant of princes was driven to the brink of persecution; and the life of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> was too long, since he lived to condemn the virtue of <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> and Symmachus.
 (88) Character, studies, and honours of Boethius.
 The senator <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> (89) is the last of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> whom <PERSON>Cato</PERSON> or <PERSON>Tully</PERSON> could have acknowledged for their countryman.
 As a wealthy orphan, he inherited the patrimony and honours of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, a name ambitiously assumed by the kings and emperors of the age; and the appellation of <PERSON>Manlius</PERSON> asserted his genuine or fabulous descent from a race of consuls and dictators, who had repulsed the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> from the Capitol, and sacrificed their sons to the discipline of the republic.
 In the youth of <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> the studies of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were not totally abandoned; a <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> (90) is now extant, corrected by the hand of a consul; and the professors of grammar, rhetoric, and jurisprudence, were maintained in their privileges and pensions by the liberality of the Goths.
 But the erudition of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> language was insufficient to satiate his ardent curiosity: and <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> is said to have employed eighteen laborious years in the schools of Athens, (91) which were supported by the zeal, the learning, and the diligence of <PERSON>Proclus</PERSON> and his disciples.
 The reason and piety of their <NORP>Roman</NORP> pupil were fortunately saved from the contagion of mystery and magic, which polluted the groves of the academy; but he imbibed the spirit, and imitated the method, of his dead and living masters, who attempted to reconcile the strong and subtle sense of <PERSON>Aristotle</PERSON> with the devout contemplation and sublime fancy of Plato.
 After his return to Rome, and his marriage with the daughter of his friend, the patrician Symmachus, <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> still continued, in a palace of ivory and marble, to prosecute the same studies.
 (92) The church was edified by his profound defence of the orthodox creed against the Arian, the Eutychian, and the <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> heresies; and the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> unity was explained or exposed in a formal treatise by the indifference of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> distinct though consubstantial persons.
 For the benefit of his <NORP>Latin</NORP> readers, his genius submitted to teach the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> elements of the arts and sciences of Greece.
 The geometry of Euclid, the music of Pythagoras, the arithmetic of Nicomachus, the mechanics of Archimedes, the astronomy of Ptolemy, the theology of Plato, and the logic of Aristotle, with the commentary of Porphyry, were translated and illustrated by the indefatigable pen of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senator.
 And he alone was esteemed capable of describing the wonders of art, a sun-dial, a water-clock, or a sphere which represented the motions of the planets.
 From these abstruse speculations, <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> stooped, or, to speak more truly, he rose to the social duties of public and private life: the indigent were relieved by his liberality; and his eloquence, which flattery might compare to the voice of <PERSON>Demosthenes</PERSON> or Cicero, was uniformly exerted in the cause of innocence and humanity.
 Such conspicuous merit was felt and rewarded by a discerning prince: the dignity of <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> was adorned with the titles of consul and patrician, and his talents were usefully employed in the important station of master of the offices.
 Notwithstanding the equal claims of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons were created, in their tender youth, the consuls of the same year.
 (93) On the memorable day of their inauguration, they proceeded in solemn pomp from their palace to the forum amidst the applause of the senate and people; and their joyful father, the true consul of Rome, after pronouncing an oration in the praise of his royal benefactor, distributed a triumphal largess in the games of the circus.
 Prosperous in his fame and fortunes, in his public honours and private alliances, in the cultivation of science and the consciousness of virtue, <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> might have been styled happy, if that precarious epithet could be safely applied before the last term of the life of man.
 His patriotism.
 A philosopher, liberal of his wealth and parsimonious of his time, might be insensible to the common allurements of ambition, the thirst of gold and employment.
 And some credit may be due to the asseveration of Boethius, that he had reluctantly obeyed the divine Plato, who enjoins every virtuous citizen to rescue the state from the usurpation of vice and ignorance.
 For the integrity of his public conduct he appeals to the memory of his country.
 His authority had restrained the pride and oppression of the royal officers, and his eloquence had delivered <PERSON>Paulianus</PERSON> from the dogs of the palace.
 He had always pitied, and often relieved, the distress of the provincials, whose fortunes were exhausted by public and private rapine; and <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> alone had courage to oppose the tyranny of the Barbarians, elated by conquest, excited by avarice, and, as he complains, encouraged by impunity.
 In these honourable contests his spirit soared above the consideration of danger, and perhaps of prudence; and we may learn from the example of Cato, that a character of pure and inflexible virtue is the most apt to be misled by prejudice, to be heated by enthusiasm, and to confound private enmities with public justice.
 The disciple of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> might exaggerate the infirmities of nature, and the imperfections of society; and the mildest form of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kingdom, even the weight of allegiance and gratitude, must be insupportable to the free spirit of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> patriot.
 But the favor and fidelity of <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> declined in just proportion with the public happiness; and an unworthy colleague was imposed to divide and control the power of the master of the offices.
 In the last gloomy season of Theodoric, he indignantly felt that he was a slave; but as his master had only power over his life, he stood without arms and without fear against the face of an angry Barbarian, who had been provoked to believe that the safety of the senate was incompatible with his own.
 He is accused of treason.
 The senator <PERSON>Albinus</PERSON> was accused and already convicted on the presumption of hoping, as it was said, the liberty of Rome.
 These laws might not have punished the simple and barren wish of an unattainable blessing; but they would have shown less indulgence to the rash confession of Boethius, that, had he known of a conspiracy, the tyrant never should.
 (94) The advocate of <PERSON>Albinus</PERSON> was soon involved in the danger and perhaps the guilt of his client; their signature (which they denied as a forgery) was affixed to the original address, inviting the emperor to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths; and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> witnesses of honourable rank, perhaps of infamous reputation, attested the treasonable designs of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> patrician.
 (95) Yet his innocence must be presumed, since he was deprived by <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> of the means of justification, and rigorously confined in the tower of Pavia, while the senate, at the distance of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles, pronounced a sentence of confiscation and death against the most illustrious of its members.
 At the command of the Barbarians, the occult science of a philosopher was stigmatized with the names of sacrilege and magic.
 (96) A devout and dutiful attachment to the senate was condemned as criminal by the trembling voices of the senators themselves; and their ingratitude deserved the wish or prediction of Boethius, that, after him, none should be found guilty of the same offence.
 (97) His imprisonment and death, A.
D.
 524.
 While Boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected each moment the sentence or the stroke of death, he composed, in the tower of Pavia, the Consolation Of Philosophy; a golden volume not unworthy of the leisure of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> or Tully, but which claims incomparable merit from the barbarism of the times and the situation of the author.
 The celestial guide, whom he had so long invoked at <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Athens, now condescended to illumine his dungeon, to revive his courage, and to pour into his wounds her salutary balm.
 She taught him to compare his long prosperity and his recent distress, and to conceive new hopes from the inconstancy of fortune.
 Reason had informed him of the precarious condition of her gifts; experience had satisfied him of their real value; he had enjoyed them without guilt; he might resign them without a sigh, and calmly disdain the impotent malice of his enemies, who had left him happiness, since they had left him virtue.
 From the earth, <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> ascended to heaven in search of the SUPREME GOOD; explored the metaphysical labyrinth of chance and destiny, of prescience and free will, of time and eternity; and generously attempted to reconcile the perfect attributes of the Deity with the apparent disorders of his moral and physical government.
 Such topics of consolation so obvious, so vague, or so abstruse, are ineffectual to subdue the feelings of human nature.
 Yet the sense of misfortune may be diverted by the labour of thought; and the sage who could artfully combine in the same work the various riches of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, must already have possessed the intrepid calmness which he affected to seek.
 Suspense, the worst of evils, was at length determined by the ministers of death, who executed, and perhaps exceeded, the inhuman mandate of Theodoric.
 A strong cord was fastened round the head of Boethius, and forcibly tightened, till his eyes almost started from their sockets; and some mercy may be discovered in the milder torture of beating him with clubs till he expired.
 (98) But his genius survived to diffuse a ray of knowledge over the darkest ages of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world; the writings of the philosopher were translated by the most glorious of the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> kings, (99) and the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> emperor of the name of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> removed to a more honorable tomb the bones of a <NORP>Catholic</NORP> saint, who, from his <NORP>Arian</NORP> persecutors, had acquired the honors of martyrdom, and the fame of miracles.
 (100) In the last hours of Boethius, he derived some comfort from the safety of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, of his wife, and of his father-in-law, the venerable Symmachus.
 But the grief of <PERSON>Symmachus</PERSON> was indiscreet, and perhaps disrespectful: he had presumed to lament, he might dare to revenge, the death of an injured friend.
 Death of Symmachus, A.
D.
 525.
 He was dragged in chains from <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the palace of Ravenna; and the suspicions of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> could only be appeased by the blood of an innocent and aged senator.
 (101) Remorse and death of Theodoric, A.
D.
 526, <DATE>August</DATE> 30.
 Humanity will be disposed to encourage any report which testifies the jurisdiction of conscience and the remorse of kings; and philosophy is not ignorant that the most horrid spectres are sometimes created by the powers of a disordered fancy, and the weakness of a distempered body.
 After a life of virtue and glory, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> was now descending with shame and guilt into the grave; his mind was humbled by the contrast of the past, and justly alarmed by the invisible terrors of futurity.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> evening, as it is related, when the head of a large fish was served on the royal table, (102) he suddenly exclaimed, that he beheld the angry countenance of Symmachus, his eyes glaring fury and revenge, and his mouth armed with long sharp teeth, which threatened to devour him.
 The monarch instantly retired to his chamber, and, as he lay, trembling with aguish cold, under a weight of bed-clothes, he expressed, in broken murmurs to his physician Elpidius, his deep repentance for the murders of <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> and Symmachus.
 (103) His malady increased, and after a dysentery which continued <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days, he expired in the palace of Ravenna, in the thirty-third, or, if we compute from the invasion of Italy, in the thirty-seventh year of his reign.
 Conscious of his approaching end, he divided his treasures and provinces between his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> grandsons, and fixed the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> as their common boundary.
 (104) <PERSON>Amalaric</PERSON> was restored to the throne of Spain.
 Italy, with all the conquests of the Ostrogoths, was bequeathed to Athalaric; whose age did not exceed ten years, but who was cherished as the last male offspring of the line of Amali, by the short-lived marriage of his mother <PERSON>Amalasuntha</PERSON> with a royal fugitive of the same blood.
 (105) In the presence of the dying monarch, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> chiefs and <NORP>Italian</NORP> magistrates mutually engaged their faith and loyalty to the young prince, and to his guardian mother; and received, in the same awful moment, his last salutary advice, to maintain the laws, to love the senate and people of Rome, and to cultivate with decent reverence the friendship of the emperor.
 (106) The monument of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> was erected by his daughter Amalasuntha, in a conspicuous situation, which commanded the city of Ravenna, the harbor, and the adjacent coast.
 A chapel of a circular form, thirty feet in diameter, is crowned by a dome of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> entire piece of granite: from the centre of the dome <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> columns arose, which supported, in a vase of porphyry, the remains of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, surrounded by the brazen statues of the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> apostles.
 (107) His spirit, after some previous expiation, might have been permitted to mingle with the benefactors of mankind, if an <NORP>Italian</NORP> hermit had not been witness, in a vision, to the damnation of Theodoric, (108) whose soul was plunged, by the ministers of divine vengeance, into the volcano of Lipari, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the flaming mouths of the infernal world.
