Foundation of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> — Political System of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and His Successors —Military Discipline —The Palace —FinancesTHE unfortunate <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> was the last rival who opposed the greatness, and the last captive who adorned the triumph, of Constantine.
 After a tranquil and prosperous reign the conqueror bequeathed to his family the inheritance of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire; a new capital, a new policy, and a new religion; and the innovations which he established have been embraced and consecrated by succeeding generations.
 The age of the great <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and his sons is filled with important events; but the historian must be oppressed by their number and variety, unless he diligently separates from each other the scenes which are connected only by the order of time.
 He will describe the political institutions that gave strength and stability to the empire before he proceeds to relate the wars and revolutions which hastened its decline.
 He will adopt the division unknown to the ancients of civil and ecclesiastical affairs: the victory of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and their intestine discord, will supply copious and distinct materials both for edification and for scandal.
Design of a new capital.
 A.
D.
 324 After the defeat and abdication of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> his victorious rival proceeded to lay the foundations of a city destined to reign in future times the mistress of the East, and to survive the empire and religion of Constantine.
 The motives, whether of pride or of policy, which <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> induced <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> to withdraw himself from the ancient seat of government, had acquired additional weight by the example of his successors and the habits of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> years.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was insensibly confounded with the dependent kingdoms which had once acknowledged her supremacy; and the country of the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> was viewed with cold indifference by a martial prince, born in the neighbourhood of the Danube, educated in the courts and armies of Asia, and invested with the purple by the legions of Britain.
 The Italians, who had received <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> as their deliverer, submissively obeyed the edicts which he sometimes condescended to address to the senate and people of Rome; but they were seldom honoured with the presence of their new sovereign.
 During the vigour of his age Constantine, according to the various exigencies of peace and war, moved with slow dignity or with active diligence along the frontiers of his extensive dominions; and was always prepared to take the field either against a foreign or a domestic enemy.
 But as he gradually reached the summit of prosperity and the decline of life, he began to meditate the design of fixing in a more permanent station the strength as well as majesty of the throne.
 In the choice of an advantageous situation he preferred the confines of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia; to curb with a powerful arm the barbarians who dwelt between the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the Tanais; to watch with an eye of jealousy the conduct of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch, who indignantly supported the yoke of an ignominious treaty.
 With these views <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> had selected and embellished the residence of Nicomedia: but the memory of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was justly abhorred by the protector of the church; and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was not insensible to the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate the glory of his own name.
 During the late operations of the war against <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> he had sufficient opportunity to contemplate, both as a soldier and as a statesman, Situation of <GPE>Byzantium</GPE> the incomparable position of Byzantium; and to observe how strongly it was guarded by nature against an hostile attack, whilst it was accessible on every side to the benefits of commercial intercourse.
 Many ages before Constantine, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most judicious historians of antiquity (1) had described the advantages of a situation from whence a feeble colony of <NORP>Greeks</NORP> derived the command of the sea, and the honours of a flourishing and independent republic.
 (2)Description of CONSTANTINOPLE If we survey <GPE>Byzantium</GPE> in the extent which it acquired with the august name of Constantinople, the figure of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city may be represented under that of an unequal triangle.
 The obtuse point, which advances towards the east and the shores of Asia, meets and repels the waves of the Thracian Bosphorus.
 The northern side of the city is bounded by the harbour, and the southern is washed by the <NORP>Propontis</NORP> or Sea of Marmora.
 The basis of the triangle is opposed to the west, and terminates the continent of Europe.
 But the admirable form and division of the circumjacent land and water cannot, without a more ample explanation, be clearly or sufficiently understood.
 The <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> The winding channel through which the waters of the <LOC>Euxine</LOC> flow with a rapid and incessant course towards the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> received the appellation of Bosphorus, a name not less celebrated in the history than in the fables of antiquity.
 (3) A crowd of temples and of votive altars, profusely scattered along its steep and woody banks, attested the unskilfulness, the terrors, and the devotion of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> navigators who, after the example of the Argonauts, explored the dangers of the inhospitable Euxine.
 On these banks tradition long preserved the memory of the palace of Phineus, infested by the obscene harpies; (4) and of the sylvan reign of Amycus, who defied the son of <PERSON>Leda</PERSON> to the combat of the Cestus.
 (5) The straits of the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> are terminated by the <NORP>Cyanean</NORP> rocks, which, according to the description of the poets, had once floated on the face of the waters, and were destined by the gods to protect the entrance of the <LOC>Euxine</LOC> against the eye of profane curiosity.
 (6) From the <NORP>Cyanean</NORP> rocks to the point and harbour of <GPE>Byzantium</GPE> the winding length of the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> extends about <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> miles, (7) and its most ordinary breadth may be computed at about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half.
 The new castles of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> are constructed, on either continent, upon the foundations of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> celebrated temples, of <PRODUCT>Serapis</PRODUCT> and of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> Urius.
 The old castles, a work of the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> emperors command the narrowest part of the channel, in a place where the opposite banks advance within <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> paces of each other.
 These fortresses were restored and strengthened by <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> when he meditated the siege of Constantinople: (8) but the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> conqueror was most probably ignorant that, near <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <DATE>years</DATE> before his reign, <PERSON>Darius</PERSON> had chosen the same situation to connect the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> continents by a bridge of boats.
 (9) At a small distance from the old castles we discover the little town of Chrysopolis, or Scutari, which may almost be considered as the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> suburb of Constantinople.
 The Bosphorus, as it begins to open into the Propontis, passes between <GPE>Byzantium</GPE> and Chalcedon.
 The latter of those cities was built by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> a few <DATE>years</DATE> before the former; and the blindness of its founders, who overlooked the superior advantages of the opposite coast, has been stigmatised by a proverbial expression of contempt.
 (10) The Port The harbour of Constantinople, which may be considered as an arm of the Bosphorus, obtained, in a very remote period, the denomination of the Golden Horn.
 The curve which it describes might be compared to the horn of a stag, or as it should seem, with more propriety, to that of an ox.
 (11) The epithet of golden was expressive of the riches which every wind wafted from the most distant countries into the secure and capacious port of Constantinople.
 The river Lycus, formed by the conflux of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> little streams, pours into the harbour a perpetual supply of fresh water, which serves to cleanse the bottom and to invite the periodical shoals of fish to seek their retreat in that convenient recess.
 As the vicissitudes of tides are scarcely felt in those seas, the constant depth of the harbour allows goods to be landed on the quays without the assistance of boats; and it has been observed that, in many places, the largest vessels may rest their prows against the houses while their sterns are floating in the water.
 (12) From the mouth of the <LOC>Lycus</LOC> to that of the harbour this arm of the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> is more than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> miles in length.
 The entrance is about <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> yards broad, and a strong chain could be occasionally drawn across it to guard the port and city from the attack of an hostile navy.
 (13) The <NORP>Propontis</NORP> Between the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> and the Hellespont, the shores of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> receding on either side inclose the Sea of Marmora, which was known to the ancients by the denomination of Propontis.
 The navigation from the issue of the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> to the entrance of the <FAC>Hellespont</FAC> is about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> miles.
 Those who steer their westward course through the middle of the <NORP>Propontis</NORP> may at once descry the high lands of <GPE>Thrace</GPE> and Bithynia, and never lose sight of the lofty summit of Mount Olympus, covered with eternal snows.
 (14) They leave on the left a deep gulf, at the bottom of which <GPE>Nicomedia</GPE> was seated, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> residence of Diocletian; and they pass the small islands of <LOC>Cyzicus</LOC> and <LOC>Proconnesus</LOC> before they cast anchor at Gallipoli, where the sea, which separates <LOC>Asia</LOC> from Europe, is again contracted into a narrow channel.
 The <FAC>Hellespont</FAC> The geographers who, with the most skilful accuracy, have surveyed the form and extent of the Hellespont, assign about sixty miles for the winding course, and about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles for the ordinary breadth, of those celebrated straits.
 (15) But the narrowest part of the channel is found to the northward of the old <NORP>Turkish</NORP> castles, between the cities of <GPE>Sestus</GPE> and Abydus.
 It was here that the adventurous <PERSON>Leander</PERSON> braved the passage of the flood for the possession of his mistress.
 (16) It was here likewise, in a place where the distance between the opposite banks cannot exceed <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> paces, that <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> imposed a stupendous bridge of boats, for the purpose of transporting into <LOC>Europe</LOC> a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and seventy myriads of barbarians.
 (17) A sea contracted within such narrow limit may seem but ill to deserve the singular epithet of broad, which Homer, as well as Orpheus, has frequently bestowed on the Hellespont.
 But our ideas of greatness are of a relative nature: the traveller, and especially the poet, who sailed along the Hellespont, who pursued the windings of the stream, and contemplated the rural scenery, which appeared on every side to terminate the prospect, insensibly lost the remembrance of the sea; and his fancy painted those celebrated straits with all the attributes of a mighty river, flowing with a swift current, in the midst of a woody and inland country, and at length, through a wide mouth, discharging itself into the <LOC>Aegean</LOC> or Archipelago.
 (18) Ancient Troy, (19) seated on an eminence at the foot of Mount Ida, overlooked the mouth of the Hellespont, which scarcely received an accession of waters from the tribute of those immortal rivulets the <PERSON>Simois</PERSON> and Scamander.
 The <NORP>Grecian</NORP> camp had stretched <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles along the shore, from the <LOC>Sigean</LOC> to the Rhoetean promontory; and the flanks of the army were guarded by the bravest chiefs who fought under the banners of Agamemnon.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of those promontories was occupied by <PERSON>Achilles</PERSON> with his invincible myrmidons, and the dauntless <GPE>Ajax</GPE> pitched his tents on the other.
 After <GPE>Ajax</GPE> had fallen a sacrifice to his disappointed pride and to the ingratitude of the Greeks, his sepulchre was created on the ground where he had defended the navy against the rage of <PERSON>Jove</PERSON> and Hector; and the citizens of the rising town of <GPE>Rhoeteum</GPE> celebrated his memory with divine honours.
 (20) Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> gave a just preference to the situation of Byzantium, he had conceived the design of erecting the seat of empire on this celebrated spot, from whence the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived their fabulous origin.
 The extensive plain which lies below ancient Troy, towards the Rhoetean promontory and the tomb of Ajax, was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> chosen for his new capital; and, though the undertaking was soon relinquished, the stately remains of unfinished walls and towers attracted the notice of all who sailed through the straits of the Hellespont.
 (21) Advantages of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> We are at present qualified to view the advantageous position of Constantinople, which appears to have been formed by nature for the centre and capital of a great monarchy.
 Situated in the <DATE>forty-first</DATE> degree of latitude, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city commanded, from her <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hills, (22) the opposite shores of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia; the climate was healthy and temperate, the soil fertile, the harbour secure and capacious, and the approach on the side of the continent was of small extent and easy defence.
 The <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> and the <FAC>Hellespont</FAC> may be considered as the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> gates of Constantinople, and the prince who possessed those important passages could always shut them against a naval enemy and open them to the fleets of commerce.
 The preservation of the eastern provinces may, in some degree, be ascribed to the policy of Constantine, as the barbarians of the Euxine, who in the preceding age had poured their armaments into the heart of the Mediterranean, soon desisted from the exercise of piracy, and despaired of forcing this insurmountable barrier.
 When the gates of the <FAC>Hellespont</FAC> and <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> were shut, the capital still enjoyed within their spacious enclosure every production which could supply the wants or gratify the luxury of its numerous inhabitants.
 The seacoasts of <GPE>Thrace</GPE> and Bithynia, which languish under the weight of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> oppression, still exhibit a rich prospect of vineyards, of gardens, and of plentiful harvests; and the <NORP>Propontis</NORP> has ever been renowned for an inexhaustible store of the most exquisite fish, that are taken in their stated seasons, without skill, and almost without labour.
 (23) But when the passages of the straits were thrown open for trade, they alternately admitted the natural and artificial riches of the north and south, of the <LOC>Euxine</LOC> and of the Mediterranean.
 Whatever rude commodities were collected in the forests of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia, as far as the sources of the <NORP>Tanais</NORP> and the Borysthenes; whatsoever was manufactured by the skill of <LOC>Europe</LOC> or Asia; the corn of Egypt, and the gems and spices of the farthest India, were brought by the varying winds into the port of Constantinople, which, for many ages, attracted the commerce of the ancient world.
 (24) Foundation of the city.
 The prospect of beauty, of safety, and of wealth, united in a single spot, was sufficient to justify the choice of Constantine.
 But as some decent mixture of prodigy and fable has, in every age, been supposed to reflect a becoming majesty on the origin of great cities, (25) the emperor was desirous of ascribing his resolution not so much to the uncertain counsels of human policy as to the infallible and eternal decrees of divine wisdom.
 In <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his laws he has been careful to instruct posterity that, in obedience to the commands of God, he laid the everlasting foundations of Constantinople; (26) and though he has not condescended to relate in what manner the celestial inspiration was communicated to his mind, the defect of his modest silence has been liberally supplied by the ingenuity of succeeding writers, who describe the nocturnal vision which appeared to the fancy of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> as he slept within the walls of Byzantium.
 The tutelar genius of the city, a venerable matron sinking under the weight of <DATE>years</DATE> and infirmities, was suddenly transformed into a blooming maid, whom his own hands adorned with all the symbols of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> greatness.
 (27) The monarch awoke, interpreted the auspicious omen, and obeyed, without hesitation, the will of Heaven.
 The day which gave birth to a city or colony was celebrated by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> with such ceremonies as had been ordained by a generous superstition; (28) and though <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> might omit some rites which savoured too strongly of their <NORP>Pagan</NORP> origin, yet he was anxious to leave a deep impression of hope and respect on the minds of the spectators.
 On foot, with a lance in his hand, the emperor himself led the solemn procession, and directed the line which was traced as the boundary of the destined capital, till the growing circumference was observed with astonishment by the assistants, who, at length ventured to observe that he had already exceeded the most ample measure of a great city.
 Without presuming to investigate the nature or motives of this extraordinary conductor, we shall content ourselves with the more humble task of describing the extent and limits of Constantinople.
 (30) Extent In the actual state of the city, the palace and gardens of the <NORP>Seraglio</NORP> occupy the eastern promontory, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hills, and cover about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty acres of our own measure.
 The seat of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> jealousy and despotism is erected on the foundations of a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> republic; but it may be supposed that the <NORP>Byzantines</NORP> were tempted by the conveniency of the harbour to extend their habitations on that side beyond the modern limits of the Seraglio.
 The new wall of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> stretched from the port to the <NORP>Propontis</NORP> across the enlarged breadth of the triangle, at the distance of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> stadia from the ancient fortification, and with the city of <GPE>Byzantium</GPE> they enclosed <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hills which, to the eyes of those who approach Constantinople, appear to rise above each other in beautiful order.
 (31) About a century after the death of the founder, the new buildings, extending on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> side up the harbour, and on the other along the Propontis, already covered the narrow ridge of the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> and the broad summit of the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> hill.
 The necessity of protecting those suburbs from the incessant inroads of the barbarians engaged the younger <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> to surround his capital with an adequate and permanent enclosure of walls.
 (32) From the eastern promontory to the golden gate, the extreme length of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> miles, (33) the circumference measured between <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> and eleven, and the surface might be computed as equal to about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand English acres.
 It is impossible to justify the vain and credulous exaggerations of modern travellers, who have sometimes stretched the limits of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> over the adjacent villages of the <NORP>European</NORP> and even of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> coast.
 (34) But the suburbs of <GPE>Pera</GPE> and Galata, though situate beyond the harbour, may deserve to be considered as a part of the city; (35) and this addition may perhaps authorise the measure of a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian, who assigns <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> (about <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> Roman) miles for the circumference of his native city.
 (36) Such an extent may seem not unworthy of an <NORP>Imperial</NORP> residence.
 Yet <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> must yield to <GPE>Babylon</GPE> and Thebes, (37) to ancient Rome, to London, and even to Paris.
 (38) Progress of the work.
 The master of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, who aspired to erect an eternal monument of the glories of his reign, could employ in the prosecution of that great work the wealth, the labour, and all that yet remained of the genius, of obedient millions.
 Some estimate may be formed of the expense bestowed with <NORP>Imperial</NORP> liberality on the foundation of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by the allowance of about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand pounds for the construction of the walls, the porticoes, and the aqueducts.
 (39) The forests that overshadowed the shores of the Euxine, and the celebrated quarries of white marble in the little island of Proconnesus, supplied an inexhaustible stock of materials, ready to be conveyed, by the convenience of a short water-carriage, to the harbour of Byzantium.
 (40) A multitude of labourers and artificers urged the conclusion of the work with incessant toil; but the impatience of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> soon discovered that, in the decline of the arts, the skill as well as numbers of his architects bore a very unequal proportion to the greatness of his designs.
 The magistrates of the most distant provinces were therefore directed to institute schools, to appoint professors, and, by the hopes of rewards and privileges, to engage in the study and practice of architecture a sufficient number of ingenious youths who had received a liberal education.
 (41) The buildings of the new city were executed by such artificers as the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> could afford; but they were decorated by the hands of the most celebrated masters of the age of <PERSON>Pericles</PERSON> and Alexander.
 To revive the genius of <GPE>Phidias</GPE> and <PERSON>Lysippus</PERSON> surpassed indeed the power of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor; but the immortal productions which they had bequeathed to posterity were exposed without defence to the rapacious vanity of a despot.
 By his commands the cities of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> were despoiled of their most valuable ornaments.
 (42) The trophies of memorable wars, the objects of religious veneration, the most finished statues of the gods and heroes, of the sages and poets of ancient times, contributed to the splendid triumph of Constantinople; and gave occasion to the remark of the historian Cedrenus, (43) who observes, with some enthusiasm, that nothing seemed wanting except the souls of the illustrious men whom these admirable monuments were intended to represent.
 But it is not in the city of Constantine, nor in the declining period of an empire, when the human mind was depressed by civil and religious slavery, that we should seek for the souls of <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> and of Demosthenes.
 Edifices During the siege of <GPE>Byzantium</GPE> the conqueror had pitched his tent on the commanding eminence of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> hill.
 To perpetuate the memory of his success, he chose the same advantageous position for the principal Forum, (44) which appears to have been of a circular or rather elliptical form.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> opposite entrances formed triumphal arches; the porticoes, which enclosed it on every side, were filled with statues, and the centre of the <ORG>Forum</ORG> was occupied by a lofty column, of which a mutilated fragment is now degraded by the appellation of the burnt pillar.
 This column was erected on a pedestal of white marble <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> feet high, and was composed of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> pieces of porphyry, each of which measured about <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> feet in height, and about thirty-three in circumference.
 (45) On the summit of the pillar, above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> feet from the ground, stood the colossal statue of Apollo.
 It was of bronze, had been transported either from <GPE>Athens</GPE> or from a town of Phrygia, and was supposed to be the work of Phidias.
 The artist had represented the god of day, or, as it was afterwards interpreted, the emperor <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> himself, with a sceptre in his right hand, the globe of the world in his left, and a crown of rays glittering on his head.
 (46) The Circus, or Hippodrome, was a stately building about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> paces in length, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> in breadth.
 (47) The space between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> metæ or goals was filled with statues and obelisks; and we may still remark a very singular fragment of antiquity, the bodies of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> serpents twisted into <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> pillar of brass.
 Their triple heads had once supported the golden tripod which, after the defeat of Xerxes, was consecrated in the temple of <ORG>Delphi</ORG> by the victorious Greeks.
 (48) The beauty of the <FAC>Hippodrome</FAC> has been long since defaced by the rude hands of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> conquerors, but, under the similar appellation of Atmeidan, it still serves as a place of exercise for their horses.
 From the throne, whence the emperor viewed the <NORP>Circensian</NORP> games a winding staircase (49) descended to the palace, a magnificent edifice, which scarcely yielded to the residence of <GPE>Rome</GPE> itself, and which, together with the dependent courts, gardens, and porticoes, covered a considerable extent of ground upon the banks of the Propontis, between the <FAC>Hippodrome</FAC> and the church of St.
 Sophia.
 (50) We might likewise celebrate the baths, which still retained the name of Zeuxippus, after they had been enriched by the munificence of Constantine, with lofty columns, various marbles, and above three-score statues of bronze.
 (51) But we should deviate from the design of this history if we attempted minutely to describe the different buildings or quarters of the city.
 It may be sufficient to observe that whatever could adorn the dignity of a great capital, or contribute to the benefit or pleasure of its numerous inhabitants, was contained within the walls of Constantinople.
 A particular description composed about a century after its foundation, enumerates a capitol or school of learning, a circus, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> theatres, <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> public and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty-three private baths, <CARDINAL>fifty-two</CARDINAL> porticoes, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> granaries, <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> aqueducts or reservoirs of water, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> spacious halls for the meetings of the senate or courts of justice, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> churches, <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> palaces, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-eight houses which, for their size or beauty, deserved to be distinguished from the multitude of plebeian habitations.
 (52) Population The populousness of his favoured city was the next and most serious object of the attention of its founder.
 In the dark ages which succeeded the translation of the empire, the remote and the immediate consequences of that memorable event were strangely confounded by the vanity of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the credulity of the Latins.
 (53) It was asserted and believed that all the noble families of Rome, the senate, and the equestrian order, with their innumerable attendants, had followed their emperor to the banks of the Propontis; that a spurious race of strangers and plebeians was left to possess the solitude of the ancient capital; and that the lands of Italy, long since converted into gardens, were at once deprived of cultivation and inhabitants.
 (54) In the course of this history such exaggerations will be reduced to their just value; yet since the growth of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> cannot be ascribed to the general increase of mankind and of industry, it must be admitted that this artificial colony was raised at the expense of the ancient cities of the empire.
 Many opulent senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of the eastern provinces were probably invited by <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to adopt for their country the fortunate spot which he had chosen for his own residence.
 The invitations of a master are scarcely to be distinguished from commands, and the liberality of the emperor obtained a ready and cheerful obedience.
 He bestowed on his favourites the palaces which he had built in the several quarters of the city, assigned them lands and pensions for the support of their dignity, (55) and alienated the demesnes of <LOC>Pontus</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> to grant hereditary estates by the easy tenure of maintaining a house in the capital.
 (56) But these encouragements and obligations soon became superfluous, and were gradually abolished.
 Wherever the seat of government is fixed, a considerable part of the public revenue will be expended by the prince himself, by his ministers, by the officers of justice, and by the domestics of the palace.
 The most wealthy of the provincials will be attracted by the powerful motives of interest and duty, of amusement and curiosity.
 A <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> and more numerous class of inhabitants will insensibly be formed, of servants, of artificers, and of merchants, who derive their subsistence from their own labour, and from the wants or luxury of the superior ranks.
 In less than a century <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> disputed with <GPE>Rome</GPE> itself the pre-eminence of riches and numbers.
 New piles of buildings, crowded together with too little regard to health or convenience, scarcely allowed the intervals of narrow streets for the perpetual throng of men, of horses, and of carriages.
 The allotted space of ground was insufficient to contain the increasing people, and the additional foundations, which on either side were advanced into the sea, might alone have composed a very considerable city.
 (57) Privileges The frequent and regular distributions of wine and oil, of corn or bread, of money or provisions, had almost exempted the poorer citizens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> from the necessity of labour.
 The magnificence of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> was in some measure imitated by the founder of Constantinople: (58) but his liberality, however it might excite the applause of the people, has incurred the censure of posterity.
 A nation of legislators and conquerors might assert their claim to the harvests of Africa, which had been purchased with their blood; and it was artfully contrived by Augustus, that, in the enjoyment of plenty, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> should lose the memory of freedom.
 But the prodigality of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> could not be excused by any consideration either of public or private interest; and the <DATE>annual</DATE> tribute of corn imposed upon <GPE>Egypt</GPE> for the benefit of his new capital was applied to feed a lazy and insolent populace, at the expense of the husbandmen of an industrious province.
 (59) Some other regulations of this emperor are less liable to blame, but they are less deserving of notice.
 He divided <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> into <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> regions or quarters, (60) dignified the public council with the appellation of senate, (61) communicated to the citizens the privileges of Italy, (62) and bestowed on the rising city the title of Colony, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most favoured daughter of ancient Rome.
 The venerable parent still maintained the legal and acknowledged supremacy, which was due to her age, to her dignity, and to the remembrance of her former greatness.
 (63) Dedication.
 A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>330</CARDINAL> or 334.
 As <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> urged the progress of the work with the impatience of a lover, the walls, the porticoes, and the principal edifices were completed in a few years, or, according to another account, in a few months: (64) but this extraordinary diligence should excite the less admiration, since many of the buildings were finished in so hasty and imperfect a manner, that, under the succeeding reign, they were preserved with difficulty from impending ruin.
 (65) But while they displayed the vigour and freshness of youth, the founder prepared to celebrate the dedication of his city.
 (66) The games and largesses which crowned the pomp of this memorable festival may easily be supposed; but there is <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> circumstance of a more singular and permanent nature, which ought not entirely to be overlooked.
 As often as the birthday of the city returned, the statue of Constantine, framed by his order, of gilt wood, and bearing in its right hand a small image of the genius of the place, was erected on a triumphal car.
 The guards, carrying white tapers, and clothed in their richest apparel, accompanied the solemn procession as it moved through the Hippodrome.
 When it was opposite to the throne of the reigning emperor, he rose from his seat, and with grateful reverence adored the memory of his predecessor.
 (67) At the festival of the dedication, an edict, engraved on a column of marble, bestowed the title of SECOND or NEW ROME on the city of Constantine.
 (68) But the name of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> (69) has prevailed over that honourable epithet, and after the revolution of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries still perpetuates the fame of its author.
 (70) Form of government.
 The foundation of a new capital is naturally connected with the establishment of a new form of civil and military administration.
 The distinct view of the complicated system of policy introduced by Diocletian, improved by Constantine, and completed by his immediate successors, may not only amuse the fancy by the singular picture of a great empire, but will tend to illustrate the secret and internal causes of its rapid decay.
 In the pursuit of any remarkable institution, we may be frequently led into the more early or the more recent times of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> history; but the proper limits of this inquiry will be included within a period of about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and thirty years, from the accession of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to the publication of the <NORP>Theodosian</NORP> code; (71) from which, as well as from the <PERSON>Notitia</PERSON> of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, (72) we derive the most copious and authentic information of the state of the empire.
 This variety of objects will suspend, for some time, the course of the narrative; but the interruption will be censured only by those readers who are insensible to the importance of laws and manners, while they peruse, with eager curiosity, the transient intrigues of a court, or the accidental event of a battle.
 Hierachy of the state.
 The manly pride of the Romans, content with substantial power, had left to the vanity of the <LOC>East</LOC> the forms and ceremonies of ostentatious greatness.
 (73) But when they lost even the semblance of those virtues which were derived from their ancient freedom, the simplicity of <NORP>Roman</NORP> manners was insensibly corrupted by the stately affectation of the courts of Asia.
 The distinctions of personal merit and influence, so conspicuous in a republic, so feeble and obscure under a monarchy, were abolished by the despotism of the emperors; who substituted in their room a severe subordination of rank and office, from the titled slaves who were seated on the steps of the throne, to the meanest instruments of arbitrary power.
 This multitude of abject dependents was interested in the support of the actual government, from the dread of a revolution which might at once confound their hopes and intercept the reward of their services.
 In this divine hierarchy (for such it is frequently styled) every rank was marked with the most scrupulous exactness, and its dignity was displayed in a variety of trifling and solemn ceremonies, which it was a study to learn and a sacrilege to neglect.
 (74) The purity of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> language was debased, by adopting, in the intercourse of pride and flattery, a profusion of epithets which <PERSON>Tully</PERSON> would scarcely have understood, and which <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> would have rejected with indignation.
 The principal officers of the empire were saluted, even by the sovereign himself, with the deceitful titles of your Sincerity, your Gravity, your Excellency, your Eminence, your sublime and wonderful Magnitude, your illustrious and magnificent Highness.
 (75) The codicils or patents of their office were curiously emblazoned with such emblems as were best adapted to explain its nature and high dignity — the image or portrait of the reigning emperors; a triumphal car; the book of mandates placed on a table, covered with a rich carpet, and illuminated by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> tapers; the allegorical figures of the provinces which they governed; or the appellations and standards of the troops whom they commanded.
 Some of these official ensigns were really exhibited in their hall of audience; others preceded their pompous march whenever they appeared in public; and every circumstance of their demeanour, their dress, their ornaments, and their train, was calculated to inspire a deep reverence for the representatives of supreme majesty.
 By a philosophic observer the system of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government might have been mistaken for a splendid theatre, filled with players of every character and degree, who repeated the language, and imitated the passions, of their original model.
 (76) <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> ranks of honour.
 All the magistrates of sufficient importance to find a place in the general state of the empire were accurately divided into <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> classes - 1, The Illustrious; 2, The Spectabiles, or Respectable; and, 3, The Clarissimi, whom we may translate by the word Honourable.
 In the times of <NORP>Roman</NORP> simplicity, the last-mentioned epithet was used only as a vague expression of deference, till it became at length the peculiar and appropriated title of all who were members of the senate, (77) and consequently of all who, from that venerable body, were selected to govern the provinces.
 The vanity of those who, from their rank and office, might claim a superior distinction above the rest of the senatorial order, was long afterwards indulged with the new appellation of Respectable: but the title of <PERSON>Illustrious</PERSON> was always reserved to some eminent personages who were obeyed or reverenced by the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> subordinate classes.
 It was communicated only, <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> divisions of officeI.
 To the consuls and patricians; II.
 To the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefects, with the praefects of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Constantinople; III.
 To the masters general of the cavalry and the infantry; and, IV.
 To the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> ministers of the palace, who exercised their 'sacred' functions about the person of the emperor.
 (78) Among those illustrious magistrates who were esteemed coordinate with each other, the seniority of appointment gave place to the union of dignities.
 (79) By the expedient of honorary codicils, the emperors, who were fond of multiplying their favours, might sometimes gratify the vanity, though not the ambition, of impatient courtiers.
 (80) The consuls I.
 As long as the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consuls were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrates of a free state, they derived their right to power from the choice of the people.
 As long as the: emperors condescended to disguise the servitude which they imposed, the consuls were still elected by the real or apparent suffrage of the senate.
 From the reign of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> even these vestiges of liberty were abolished, and the successful candidates, who were invested with the <DATE>annual</DATE> honours of the consulship, affected to deplore the humiliating condition of their predecessors.
 The <PERSON>Scipios</PERSON> and the <PERSON>Catos</PERSON> had been reduced to solicit the votes of plebians, to pass through the tedious and expensive forms of a popular election, and to expose their dignity to the shame of a public refusal; while their own happier fate had reserved them for an age and government in which the rewards of virtue were assigned by the unerring wisdom of a gracious sovereign.
 (81) In the epistles which the emperor addressed to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> consuls elect, it was declared that they were created by his sole authority.
 (82) Their names and portraits, engraved on gilt tablets of ivory, were dispersed over the empire as presents to the provinces, the cities, the magistrates, the senate and the people.
 (83) Their solemn inauguration was performed at the place of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> residence; and during a period of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> <GPE>Rome</GPE> was constantly deprived of the presence of her ancient magistrates.
 (84) On the morning of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of January the consuls assumed the ensigns of their dignity.
 Their dress was a robe of purple, embroidered in silk and gold, and sometimes ornamented with costly gems.
 (85) On this solemn occasion they were attended by the most eminent officers of the state and army in the habit of senators; and the useless fasces, armed with the once formidable axes, were borne before them by the lictors.
 (86) The procession moved from the palace (87) to the <ORG>Forum</ORG> or principal square of the city; where the consuls ascended their tribunal, and seated themselves in the curule chairs, which were framed after the fashion of ancient times.
 They immediately exercised an act of jurisdiction, by the manumission of a slave who was brought before them for that purpose; and the ceremony was intended to represent the celebrated action of the elder Brutus, the author of liberty and of the consulship, when he admitted among his fellow-citizens the faithful Vindex, who had revealed the conspiracy of the Tarquins.
 (88) The public festival was continued during several days in all the principal cities; in Rome, from custom; in Constantinople, from imitation; in Carthage, Antioch, and Alexandria, from the love of pleasure and the superfluity of wealth.
 (89) In the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> capitals of the empire the <DATE>annual</DATE> games of the theatre, the circus, and the amphitheatre (90) cost <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand pounds of gold, (about) <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty thousand pounds sterling; and if so heavy an expense surpassed the faculties or the inclination of the magistrates themselves, the sum was supplied from the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> treasury.
 (91) As soon as the consuls had discharged these customary duties, they were at liberty to retire into the shade of private life, and to enjoy during the remainder of the year the undisturbed contemplation of their own greatness.
 They no longer presided in the national councils; they no longer executed the resolutions of peace or war.
 Their abilities (unless they were employed in more effective offices) were of little moment; and their names served only as the legal date of the year in which they had filled the chair of <PERSON>Marius</PERSON> and of Cicero.
 Yet it was still felt and acknowledged, in the last period of <NORP>Roman</NORP> servitude, that this empty name might be compared, and even preferred, to the possession of substantial power.
 The title of consul was still the most splendid object of ambition, the noblest reward of virtue and loyalty.
 The emperors themselves who disdained the faint shadow of the republic, were conscious that they acquired an additional splendour and majesty as often as they assumed the <DATE>annual</DATE> honours of the consular dignity.
 (92) The patricians The proudest and most perfect separation which can be found in any age or country between the nobles and the people is perhaps that of the <NORP>Patricians</NORP> and the Plebeians, as it was established in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic.
 Wealth and honours, the offices of the state, and the ceremonies of religion, were almost exclusively possessed by the former who, preserving the purity of their blood with the most insulting jealousy, (93) held their clients in a condition of specious vassalage.
 But these distinctions, so incompatible with the spirit of a free people, were removed, after a long struggle, by the persevering efforts of the Tribunes.
 The most active and successful of the <NORP>Plebeians</NORP> accumulated wealth, aspired to honours, deserved triumphs, contracted alliances, and, after some generations, assumed the pride of ancient nobility.
 (94) The <NORP>Patrician</NORP> families, on the other hand, whose original number was never recruited till the end of the commonwealth, either failed in the ordinary course of nature, or were extinguished in so many foreign and domestic wars, or, through a want of merit or fortune, insensibly mingled with the mass of the people.
 (95) Very few remained who could derive their pure and genuine origin from the infancy of the city, or even from that of the republic, when <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Augustus, <PERSON>Claudius</PERSON> and Vespasian, created from the body of the senate a competent number of new <NORP>Patrician</NORP> families, in the hope of perpetuating an order which was still considered as honourable and sacred.
 (96) But these artificial supplies (in which the reigning house was always included) were rapidly swept away by the rage of tyrants, by frequent revolutions, by the change of manners, and by the intermixture of nations.
 (97) Little more was left when <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> ascended the throne than a vague and imperfect tradition that the <NORP>Patricians</NORP> had once been the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the Romans.
 To form a body of nobles, whose influence may restrain while it secures the authority of the monarch, would have been very inconsistent with the character and policy of Constantine; but, had he seriously entertained such a design, it might have exceeded the measure of his power to ratify by an arbitrary edict an institution which must expect the sanction of time and of opinion.
 He revived, indeed, the title of PATRICIANS, but he revived it as a personal, not as an hereditary distinction.
 They yielded only to the transient superiority of the <DATE>annual</DATE> consuls; but they enjoyed the pre-eminence over all the great officers of state, with the most familiar access to the person of the prince.
 This honourable rank was bestowed on them for life; and, as they were usually favourites and ministers who had grown old in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court, the true etymology of the word was perverted by ignorance and flattery; and the <NORP>Patricians</NORP> of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were reverenced as the adopted 'Fathers' of the emperor and the republic.
 (98) The praetorian praefects II.
 The fortunes of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefects were essentially different from those of the consuls and Patricians.
 The latter saw their ancient greatness evaporate in a vain title.
 The former, rising by degrees from the most humble condition, were invested with the civil and military administration of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 From the reign of <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> to that of Diocletian, the guards and the palace, the laws and the finances, the armies and the provinces, were intrusted to their superintending care; and, like the vizirs of the East, they held with <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hand the seal, and with the other the standard, of the empire.
 The ambition of the praefects, always formidable, and sometimes fatal to the masters whom they served, was supported by the strength of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> bands; but, after those haughty troops had been weakened by <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and finally suppressed by Constantine, the praefects, who survived their fall, were reduced without difficulty to the station of useful and obedient ministers.
 When they were no longer responsible for the safety of the emperor's person, they resigned the jurisdiction which they had hitherto claimed and exercised over all the departments of the palace.
 They were deprived by <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> of all military command as soon as they had ceased to lead into the field, under their immediate orders, the flower of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops; and, at length, by a singular revolution, the captains of the guards were transformed into the civil magistrates of the provinces.
 According to the plan of government instituted by Diocletian, the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> princes had each their <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect; and after the monarchy was once more united in the person of Constantine, he still continued to create the same number of <CARDINAL>FOUR</CARDINAL> PRAEFECTS, and intrusted to their care the same provinces which they already administered.
 1.
 The praefect of the <LOC>East</LOC> stretched his ample jurisdiction into the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> parts of the globe which were subject to the Romans, from the cataracts of the <LOC>Nile</LOC> to the banks of the Phasis, and from the mountains of <GPE>Thrace</GPE> to the frontiers of Persia.
 2.
 The important provinces of Pannonia, Dacia, Macedonia, and <GPE>Greece</GPE> once acknowledged the authority of the praefect of Illyricum.
 3.
 The power of the praefect of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was not confined to the country from whence he derived his title; it extended over the additional territory of <GPE>Rhaetia</GPE> as far as the banks of the Danube, over the dependent islands of the Mediterranean, and over that part of the continent of <LOC>Africa</LOC> which lies between the confines of <LOC>Cyrene</LOC> and those of Tingitania.
 4.
 The praefect of the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> comprehended under that plural denomination the kindred provinces of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Spain, and his authority was obeyed from the wall of <GPE>Antoninus</GPE> to the foot of Mount Atlas.
 (99)After the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefects had been dismissed from all military command, the civil functions which they were ordained to exercise over so many subject nations were adequate to the ambition and abilities of the most consummate ministers.
 To their wisdom was committed the supreme administration of justice and of the finances, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> objects which, in a state of peace, comprehend almost all the respective duties of the sovereign and of the people; of the former, to protect the citizens who are obedient to the laws; of the latter, to contribute the share of their property which is required for the expenses of the state.
 The coin, the highways, the posts, the granaries, the manufactures, whatever could interest the public prosperity, was moderated by the authority of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefects.
 As the immediate representatives of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> majesty, they were empowered to explain, to enforce, and on some occasions to modify, the general edicts by their discretionary proclamations.
 They watched over the conduct of the provincial governors, removed the negligent, and inflicted punishments on the guilty.
 From all the inferior jurisdictions an appeal in every matter of importance, either civil or criminal, might be brought before the tribunal of the praefect: but his sentence was final and absolute; and the emperors themselves refused to admit any complaints against the judgment or the integrity of a magistrate whom they honoured with such unbounded confidence.
 (100) His appointments were suitable to his dignity; (101) and, if avarice was his ruling passion, he enjoyed frequent opportunities of collecting a rich harvest of fees, of presents, and of perquisites.
 Though the emperors no longer dreaded the ambition of their praefects, they were attentive to counterbalance the power of this great office by the uncertainty and shortness of its duration.
 (102) The praefects of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Constantinople.
 From their superior importance and dignity, <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> were alone excepted from the jurisdiction of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefects.
 The immense size of the city, and the experience of the tardy, ineffectual operation of the laws, had furnished the policy of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> with a specious pretence for introducing a new magistrate, who alone could restrain a servile and turbulent populace by the strong arm of arbitrary power.
 (103) Valerius Messalla was appointed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> praefect of Rome, that his reputation might countenance so invidious a measure; but at the end of a few days that accomplished citizen (104) resigned his office, declaring, with a spirit worthy of the friend of Brutus, that he found himself incapable of exercising a power incompatible with public freedom.
 (105) As the sense of liberty became less exquisite, the advantages of order were more clearly understood; and the praefect, who seemed to have been designed as a terror only to slaves and vagrants, was permitted to extend his civil and criminal jurisdiction over the equestrian and noble families of Rome.
 The praetors, annually created as the judges of law and equity, could not long dispute the possession of the <ORG>Forum</ORG> with a vigorous and permanent magistrate who was usually admitted into the confidence of the prince.
 Their courts were deserted; their number, which had once fluctuated between <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> and eighteen, (106) was gradually reduced to <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or three; and their important functions were confined to the expensive obligation (107) of exhibiting games for the amusement of the people.
 After the office of <NORP>Roman</NORP> consuls had been changed into a vain pageant, which was rarely displayed in the capital, the praefects assumed their vacant place in the senate, and were soon acknowledged as the ordinary presidents of that venerable assembly.
 They received appeals from the distance of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles; and it was allowed as a principle of jurisprudence that all municipal authority was derived from them alone.
 (108) In the discharge of his laborious employment the governor of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was assisted by <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> officers, some of whom had been originally his equals, or even his superiors.
 The principal departments were relative to the command of a numerous watch, established as a safeguard against fires, robberies, and nocturnal disorders; the custody and distribution of the public allowance of corn and provisions; the care of the port, of the aqueducts, of the common sewers, and of the navigation and bed of the Tiber; the inspection of the markets, the theatres, and of the private as well as public works.
 Their vigilance ensured the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> principal objects of a regular police - safety, plenty, and cleanliness; and, as a proof of the attention of government to preserve the splendour and ornaments of the capital, a particular inspector was appointed for the statues; the guardian, as it were, of that inanimate people, which, according to the extravagant computation of an old writer, was scarcely inferior in number to the living inhabitants of Rome.
 About thirty <DATE>years</DATE> after the foundation of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> a similar magistrate was created in that rising metropolis, for the same uses and with the same powers.
 A perfect equality was established between the dignity of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> municipal and that of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefects.
 (109) The proconsuls, vice-praefects, etc Those who in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> hierarchy were distinguished by the title of <WORK_OF_ART>Respectable</WORK_OF_ART> formed an intermediate class between the illustrious praefects and the honourable magistrates of the provinces.
 In this class the proconsuls of Asia, Achaia, and <LOC>Africa</LOC> claimed a pre-eminence, which was yielded to the remembrance of their ancient dignity; and the appeal from their tribunal to that of the praefects was almost the only mark of their dependence.
 (110) But the civil government of the empire was distributed into <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> great DIOCESES, each of which equalled the just measure of a powerful kingdom.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these dioceses was subject to the jurisdiction of the court of the East; and we may convey some idea of the importance and variety of his functions by observing that <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> apparitors, who would be styled at present either secretaries, or clerks, or ushers, or messengers, were employed in his immediate office.
 (111) The place of <NORP>Augustal</NORP> praefect of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> was no longer filled by a <NORP>Roman</NORP> knight, but the name was retained; and the extraordinary powers which the situation of the country and the temper of the inhabitants had once made indispensable were still continued to the governor.
 The <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> remaining dioceses - of Asiana, Pontica, and Thrace; of Macedonia, Dacia, and Pannonia, or Western Illyricum; of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Africa; of Gaul, Spain, and <GPE>Britain</GPE> - were governed by <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> vicars or vice-praefects, (112) whose name sufficiently explains the nature and dependence of their office.
 It may be added that the lieutenant-generals of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies, the military counts and dukes, who will be hereafter mentioned, were allowed the rank and title of Respectable.
 The governors of the provinces As the spirit of jealousy and ostentation prevailed in the councils of the emperors, they proceeded with anxious diligence to divide the substance and to multiply the titles of power.
 The vast countries which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> conquerors had united under the same simple form of administration were imperceptibly crumbled into <TIME>minute</TIME> fragments, till at length the whole empire was distributed into <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> provinces, each of which supported an expensive and splendid establishment.
 Of these, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> were governed by proconsuls, <CARDINAL>thirty-seven</CARDINAL> by consulars, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> by correctors, and <CARDINAL>seventy-one</CARDINAL> by presidents.
 (113) The appellations of these magistrates were different; they ranked in successive order, the ensigns of their dignity were curiously varied, and their situation, from accidental circumstances, might be more or less agreeable or advantageous.
 But they were all (excepting only the proconsuls) alike included in the class of honourable persons; and they were alike intrusted, during the pleasure of the prince, and under the authority of the praefects or their deputies, with the administration of justice and the finances in their respective districts.
 The ponderous volumes of the <PRODUCT>Codes</PRODUCT> and Pandects (114) would furnish ample materials for a <TIME>minute</TIME> inquiry into the system of provincial government, as in the space of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> centuries it was improved by the wisdom of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> statesmen and lawyers.
 It may be sufficient for the historian to select <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> singular and salutary provisions, intended to restrain the abuse of authority.
 1.
 For the preservation of peace and order, the governors of the provinces were armed with the sword of justice.
 They inflicted corporal punishments and they exercised, in capital offences, the power of life and death.
 But they were not authorized to indulge the condemned criminal with the choice of his own execution or to pronounce a sentence of the mildest and most honourable kind of exile.
 These prerogatives were reserved to the praefects, who alone could impose the heavy fine of fifty pounds of gold: their vicegerents were confined to the trifling weight of a few ounces.
 (115) This distinction, which seems to grant the larger while it denies the smaller degree ofauthority, was founded on a very rational motive.
 The smaller degree was infinitely more liable to abuse.
 The passions of a provincial magistrate might frequently provoke him into acts of oppression.
 which affected only the freedom or the fortunes of the subject; though, from a principle of prudence, perhaps of humanity, he might still be terrified by the guilt of innocent blood.
 It may likewise be considered that exile, considerable fines, or the choice of an easy death, relate more particularly to the rich and the noble; and the persons the most exposed to the avarice or resentment of a provincial magistrate were thus removed from his obscure persecution to the more august and impartial tribunal of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect.
 2.
 As it was reasonably apprehended that the integrity of the judge might be biased, if his interest was concerned or his affections were engaged, the strictest regulations were established to exclude any person, without the special dispensation of the emperor, from the government of the province where he was born, (116) and to prohibit the governor or his son from contracting marriage with a native or an inhabitant, (117) or from purchasing slaves, lands, or houses within the extent of his jurisdiction.
 (118) Notwithstanding these rigorous precautions, the emperor Constantine, after a reign of <CARDINAL>twenty-five</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> still deplores the venal and oppressive administration of justice, and expresses the warmest indignation that the audience of the judge, his despatch of business, his seasonable delays, and his final sentence, were publicly sold, either by himself or by the officers of his court.
 The continuance, and perhaps the impunity, of these crimes is attested by the repetition of impotent laws and ineffectual menaces.
 (119) The profession of the law.
 All the civil magistrates were drawn from the profession of the law.
 The celebrated Institutes of Justinian are addressed to the youth of his dominions who had devoted themselves to the study of <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence; and the sovereign condescends to animate their diligence by the assurance that their skill and ability would in time be rewarded by an adequate share in the government of the republic.
 (120) The rudiments of this lucrative science were taught in all the considerable cities of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West; but the most famous school was that of Berytus, (121) on the coast of Phoenicia, which flourished above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> centuries from the time of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> Severus, the author perhaps of an Institution so advantageous to his native country.
 After a regular course of education, which lasted <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, the students dispersed themselves through the provinces in search of fortune and honours; nor could they want an inexhaustible supply of business in a great empire already corrupted by the multiplicity of laws, of arts, and of vices.
 The court of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the <LOC>East</LOC> could alone furnish employment for <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty advocates, <CARDINAL>sixty-four</CARDINAL> of whom were distinguished by peculiar privileges, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> were annually chosen with a salary of sixty pounds of gold to defend the causes of the treasury.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> experiment was made of their judicial talents by appointing them to act occasionally as assessors to the magistrates; from thence they were often raised to preside in the tribunals before which they had pleaded.
 They obtained the government of a province; and, by the aid of merit, of reputation, or of favour, they ascended, by successive steps, to the illustrious dignities of the state.
 (122) In the practice of the bar these men had considered reason as the instrument of dispute; they interpreted the laws according to the dictates of private interest; and the same pernicious habits might still adhere to their characters in the public administration of the state.
 The honour of a liberal profession has indeed been vindicated by ancient and modern advocates, who have filled the most important stations with pure integrity and consummate wisdom; but in the decline of <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence the ordinary promotion of lawyers was pregnant with mischief and disgrace.
 The noble art, which had once been preserved as the sacred inheritance of the patricians, was fallen into the hands of freedmen and plebeians, (123) who, with cunning rather than with skill, exercised a sordid and pernicious trade.
 Some of them procured admittance into families for the purpose of fomenting differences, of encouraging suits, and of preparing a harvest of gain for themselves or their brethren.
 Others, recluse in their chambers, maintained the gravity of legal professors, by furnishing a rich client with subtleties to confound the plainest truth, and with arguments to colour the most unjustifiable pretensions.
 The splendid and popular class was composed of the advocates, who filled the <ORG>Forum</ORG> with the sound of their turgid and loquacious rhetoric.
 Careless of fame and of justice, they are described for the most part as ignorant and rapacious guides, who conducted their clients through a maze of expense, of delay, and of disappointment from whence, after a tedious series of years, they were at length dismissed, when their patience and fortune were almost exhausted.
 (124) The military officers.
 III.
 In the system of policy introduced by Augustus, the governors, those at least of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> provinces, were invested with the full powers of the sovereign himself.
 Ministers of peace and war, the distribution of rewards and punishments depended on them alone, and they successively appeared on their tribunal in the robes of civil magistracy, and in complete armour at the head of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions.
 (125) The influence of the revenue, the authority of law, and the command of a military force, concurred to render their power supreme and absolute; and whenever they were tempted to violate their allegiance, the loyal province which they involved in their rebellion was scarcely sensible of any change in its political state.
 From the time of <EVENT>Commodus</EVENT> to the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> near <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> governors might be enumerated, who, with various success, erected the standard of revolt; and though the innocent were too often sacrificed, the guilty might be sometimes prevented, by the suspicious cruelty of their master.
 (126) To secure his throne and the public tranquillity from these formidable servants, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resolved to divide the military from the civil administration, and to establish, as a permanent and professional distinction, a practice which had been adopted only as an occasional expedient.
 The supreme jurisdiction exercised by the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefects over the armies of the empire was transferred to the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> masters general whom he instituted, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> for the cavalry, the other for the infantry; and though each of these illustrious officers was more peculiarly responsible for the discipline of those troops which were under his immediate inspection, they both indifferently commanded in the field the several bodies, whether of horse or foot, which were united in the same army.
 (127) Their number was soon doubled by the division of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West; and as separate generals of the same rank and title were appointed on the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> important frontiers of the Rhine, of the <LOC>Upper</LOC> and the Lower Danube, and of the Euphrates, the defence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was at length committed to <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> masters general of the cavalry and infantry.
 Under their orders, <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> military commanders were stationed in the provinces: <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> in Britain, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> in Gaul, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> in Spain, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> in Italy, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> on the <LOC>Upper</LOC> and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> on the Lower Danube, in <LOC>Asia</LOC> eight, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> in Egypt, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> in Africa.
 The titles of counts and dukes,(128) by which they were properly distinguished, have obtained in modern languages so very different a sense that the use of them may occasion some surprise.
 But it should be recollected that the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> of those appellations is only a corruption of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> word which was indiscriminately applied to any military chief.
 All these provincial generals were therefore dukes; but no more than <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> among them were dignified with the rank of counts or companions, a title of honour, or rather of favour, which had been recently invented in the court of Constantine.
 A gold belt was the ensign which distinguished the office of the counts and dukes; and, besides their pay, they received a liberal allowance sufficient to maintain <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and ninety servants and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty-eight horses.
 They were strictly prohibited from interfering in any matter which related to the administration of justice or the revenue; but the command which they exercised over the troops of their department was independent of the authority of the magistrates.
 About the same time that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> gave a legal sanction to the ecclesiastical order, he instituted in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire the nice balance of the civil and the military powers.
 The emulation, and sometimes the discord, which reigned between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> professions of opposite interests and incompatible manners, was productive of beneficial and of pernicious consequences.
 It was seldom to be expected that the general and the civil governor of a province should either conspire for the disturbance, or should unite for the service, of their country.
 While the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> delayed to offer the assistance which the other disdained to solicit, the troops very frequently remained without orders or without supplies, the public safety was betrayed, and the defenceless subjects were left exposed to the fury of the barbarians.
 The divided administration, which had been formed by Constantine, relaxed the vigour of the state, while it secured the tranquillity of the monarch.
 Distinction of the troops.
 The memory of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> has been deservedly censured for another innovation which corrupted military discipline, and prepared the ruin of the empire.
 The <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> which preceded his final victory over <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> had been a period of licence and intestine war.
 The rivals who contended for the possession of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world had withdrawn the greatest part of their forces from the guard of the general frontier; and the principal cities which formed the boundary of their respective dominions were filled with soldiers, who considered their countrymen as their most implacable enemies.
 After the use of these internal garrisons had ceased with the civil war, the conqueror wanted either wisdom or firmness to revive the severe discipline of Diocletian, and to suppress a fatal indulgence which habit had endeared and almost confirmed to the military order.
 From the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> a popular and even legal distinction was admitted between the <PERSON>Palatines</PERSON> (129) and the Borderers; the troops of the court, as they were improperly styled, and the troops of the frontier.
 The former, elevated by the superiority of their pay and privileges, were permitted, except in the extraordinary emergencies of war, to occupy their tranquil stations in the heart of the provinces.
 The most flourishing cities were oppressed by the intolerable weight of quarters.
 The soldiers insensibly forgot the virtues of their profession, and contracted only the vices of civil life.
 They were either degraded by the industry of mechanic trades, or enervated by the luxury of baths and theatres.
 They soon became careless of their martial exercises, curious in their diet and apparel, and, while they inspired terror to the subjects of the empire, they trembled at the hostile approach of the barbarians.
 (130) The chain of fortifications which <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and his colleagues had extended along the banks of the great rivers was no longer maintained with the same care, or defended with the same vigilance.
 The numbers which still remained under the name of the troops of the frontier might be sufficient for the ordinary defence.
 But their spirit was degraded by the humiliating reflection that they, who were exposed to the hardships and dangers of a perpetual warfare, were rewarded only with about two-thirds of the pay and emoluments which were lavished on the troops of the court.
 Even the bands or legions that were raised the nearest to the level of those unworthy favourites were in some measure disgraced by the title of honour which they were allowed to assume.
 It was in vain that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> repeated the most dreadful menaces of fire and sword against the <NORP>Borderers</NORP> who should dare to desert their colours, to connive at the inroads of the barbarians, or to participate in the spoil.
 (131) The mischiefs which flow from injudicious counsels are seldom removed by the application of partial severities; and though succeeding princes laboured to restore the strength and numbers of the frontier garrisons he empire, till the last moment of its dissolution, continued to languish under the mortal wound which had been so rashly or so weakly incited by the hand of Constantine.
 Reduction of the legions The same timid policy, of dividing whatever is united, of reducing whatever is eminent, of dreading every active power, and of expecting that the most feeble will prove the most obedient, seems to pervade the institutions of several princes, and particularly those of Constantine.
 The martial pride of the legions, whose victorious camps had so often been the scene of rebellion, was nourished by the memory of their past exploits, and the consciousness of their actual strength.
 As long as they maintained their ancient establishment of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand men, they subsisted, under the reign of Diocletian, each of them singly, a visible and important object in the military history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 A few <DATE>years</DATE> afterwards these gigantic bodies were shrunk to a very diminutive size; and when <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> legions, with some auxiliaries, defended the city of <GPE>Amida</GPE> against the Persians, the total garrison, with the inhabitants of both sexes, and the peasants of the deserted country, did not exceed the number of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand persons.
 (132) From this fact, and from similar examples, there is reason to believe that the constitution of the legionary troops, to which they partly owed their valour and discipline, was dissolved by Constantine; and that the bands of <NORP>Roman</NORP> infantry, which still assumed the same names and the same honours, consisted only of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand or <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> men.
 (133) The conspiracy of so many separate detachments, each of which was awed by the sense of its own weakness, could easily be checked; and the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> might indulge their love of ostentation, by issuing their orders to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and thirty-two legions, inscribed on the muster-roll of their numerous armies.
 The remainder of their troops was distributed into several <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> cohorts of infantry, and squadrons of cavalry.
 Their arms, and titles, and ensigns were calculated to inspire terror, and to display the variety of nations who marched under the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> standard.
 And not a vestige was left of that severe simplicity which, in the ages of freedom and victory, had distinguished the line of battle of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> army from the confused host of an <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> monarch.
 (134) A more particular enumeration, drawn from the Notitia, might exercise the diligence of an antiquary; but the historian will content himself with observing that the number of permanent stations or garrisons established on the frontiers of the empire amounted to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-three; and that, under the successors of Constantine, the complete force of military establishment was computed at <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and forty-five thousand soldiers.
 (135) An effort so prodigious surpassed the wants of a more ancient and the faculties of a later period.
 Difficulty of levies.
 In the various states of society armies are recruited from very different motives.
 <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> are urged by their love of war; the citizens of a free republic may be prompted by a principle of duty; the subjects, or at least the nobles, of a monarchy are animated by a sentiment of honour; but the timid and luxurious inhabitants of a declining empire must be allured into the service by the hopes of profit, or compelled by the dread of punishment.
 The resources of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> treasury were exhausted by the increase of pay, by the repetition of donatives, and by the invention of new emoluments and indulgences, which, in the opinion of the provincial youth, might compensate the hardships and dangers of a military life.
 Yet, although the stature was lowered, (136) although slaves, at least by a tacit connivance, were indiscriminately received into the ranks, the insurmountable difficulty of procuring a regular and adequate supply of volunteers obliged the emperors to adopt more effectual and coercive methods.
 The lands bestowed on the veterans, as the free reward of their valour, were henceforward granted under a condition which contains the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rudiments of the feudal tenures - that their sons, who succeeded to the inheritance, should devote themselves to the profession of arms as soon as they attained the age of manhood; and their cowardly refusal was punished by the loss of honour, of fortune, or even of life.
 (137) But as the <DATE>annual</DATE> growth of the sons of the veterans bore a very small proportion to the demands of the service, levies of men were frequently required from the provinces, and every proprietor was obliged either to take up arms, or to procure a substitute, or to purchase his exemption by the payment of a heavy fine.
 The sum of <CARDINAL>forty-two</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, to which it was reduced, ascertains the exorbitant price of volunteers, and the reluctance with which the government admitted of this alternative.
 (138) Such was the horror for the profession of a soldier which had affected the minds of the degenerate <NORP>Romans</NORP> that many of the youth of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces chose to cut off the fingers of their right hand to escape from being pressed into the service; and this strange expedient was so commonly practised as to deserve the severe animadversion of the laws, (139) and a peculiar name in the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> language.
 (140) Increase of <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> auxillaries The introduction of barbarians into the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies became every day more universal, more necessary, and more fatal.
 The most daring of the Scythians, of the Goths, and of the Germans, who delighted in war, and who found it more profitable to defend than to ravage the provinces, were enrolled not only in the auxiliaries of their respective nations, but in the legions themselves, and among the most distinguished of the <NORP>Palatine</NORP> troops.
 As they freely mingled with the subjects of the empire, they gradually learned to despise their manners and imitate their arts.
 They abjured the implicit reverence which the pride of <GPE>Rome</GPE> had exacted from their ignorance, while they acquired the knowledge and possession of those advantages by which alone she supported her declining greatness.
 The barbarian soldiers who displayed any military talents were advanced, without exception, to the most important commands; and the names of the tribunes, of the counts and dukes, and of the generals themselves, betray a foreign origin, which they no longer condescended to disguise.
 They were often intrusted with the conduct of a war against their countrymen; and though most of them preferred the ties of allegiance to those of blood, they did not always avoid the guilt, or at least the suspicion, of holding a treasonable correspondence with the enemy, of inviting his invasion, or of sparing his retreat.
 The camps and the palace of the son of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were governed by the powerful faction of the Franks, who preserved the strictest connection with each other and with their country, and who resented every personal affront as a national indignity.
 (141) When the tyrant <PERSON>Caligula</PERSON> was suspected of an intention to invest a very extraordinary candidate with the consular robes, the sacrilegious profanation would have scarcely excited less astonishment if, instead of a horse, the noblest chieftain of <GPE>Germany</GPE> or <GPE>Britain</GPE> had been the object of his choice.
 The revolution of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> centuries had produced so remarkable a change in the prejudices of the people, that, with the public approbation, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> showed his successors the example of bestowing the honours of the consulship on the barbarians who, by their merit and services, had deserved to be ranked among the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the Romans.
 (142) But as these hardy veterans, who had been educated in the ignorance or contempt of the laws were incapable of exercising any civil offices, the powers of the human mind were contracted by the irreconcilable separation of talents as well as of professions.
 The accomplished citizens of the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> and <NORP>Roman</NORP> republics, whose characters could adapt themselves to the bar, the senate, to the camp, or the schools, had learned to write, to speak, and to act with the same spirit, and with equal abilities.
 <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> ministers of the palace.
 IV.
 Besides the magistrates and generals, who at a distance from the court diffused their delegated authority over the provinces and armies, the emperor conferred the rank of <PERSON>Illustrious</PERSON> on <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> of his more immediate servants, to whose fidelity he intrusted his safety, or his counsels, or his treasures.
 The chamberlain 1.
 The private apartments of the palace were governed by a favourite eunuch, who, in the language of that age, was styled the praepositus or praefect of the sacred bed-chamber.
 His duty was to attend the emperor in his <TIME>hours</TIME> of state or in those of amusement, and to perform about his person all those menial services which can only derive their splendour from the influence of royalty.
 Under a prince who deserved to reign, the great chamberlain (for such we may call him) was an useful and humble domestic; but an artful domestic, who improves every occasion of unguarded confidence, will insensibly acquire over a feeble mind that ascendant which harsh wisdom and uncomplying virtue can seldom obtain.
 The degenerate grandsons of Theodosius, who were invisible to their subjects, and contemptible to their enemies, exalted the praefects of their bed-chamber above the heads of all the ministers of the palace; (143) and even his deputy, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the splendid train of slaves who waited in the presence, was thought worthy to rank before the respectable proconsuls of <GPE>Greece</GPE> or Asia.
 The jurisdiction of the chamberlain was acknowledged by the counts, or superintendents, who regulated the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> important provinces of the magnificence of the wardrobe, and of the luxury of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> table.
 (144) The master of the offices.
2.
 The principal administration of public affairs was committed to the diligence and abilities of the master of the 0ffices.
 (145) He was the supreme magistrate of the palace, inspected the discipline of the civil and military schools, and received appeals from all parts of the empire, in the causes which related to that numerous army of privileged persons who, as the servants of the court, had obtained for themselves and families a right to decline the authority of the ordinary judges.
 The correspondence between the prince and his subjects was managed by the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> scrinia, or offices of this minister of state.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> was appropriated to memorials, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> to epistles, the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> to petitions, and the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> to papers and orders of a miscellaneous kind.
 Each of these was directed by an inferior master of respectable dignity, and the whole business was despatched by an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and forty-eight secretaries, chosen for the most part from the profession of the law, on account of the variety of abstracts of reports and references which frequently occurred in the exercise of their several functions.
 From a condescension which in former ages would have been deemed unworthy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> majesty, a particular secretary was allowed for the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> language; and interpreters were appointed to receive the ambassadors of the barbarians; but the department of foreign affairs, which constitutes so essential a part of modern policy, seldom diverted the attention of the master of the offices.
 His mind was more seriously engaged by the general direction of the posts and arsenals of the empire.
 There were <CARDINAL>thirty-four</CARDINAL> cities, <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> in the <LOC>East</LOC> and <CARDINAL>nineteen</CARDINAL> in the West, in which regular companies of workmen were perpetually employed in fabricating defensive armour, offensive weapons of all sorts, and military engines, which were deposited in the arsenals, and occasionally delivered for the service of the troops.
 The quaestor3.
 In the course of nine centuries the office of quaestor had experienced a very singular revolution.
 In the infancy of Rome, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> inferior magistrates were annually elected by the people, to relieve the consuls from the invidious management of the public treasure; (146) a similar assistant was granted to every proconsul and to every praetor who exercised a military or provincial command; with the extent of conquest, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> quaestors were gradually multiplied to the number of four, of eight, of twenty, and for a short time, perhaps, of forty; (147) and the noblest citizens ambitiously solicited an office which gave them a seat in the senate, and a just hope of obtaining the honours of the republic.
 Whilst <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> affected to maintain the freedom of election, he consented to accept the <DATE>annual</DATE> privilege of recommending, or rather indeed of nominating, a certain proportion of candidates; and it was his custom to select <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these distinguished youths to read his orations or epistles in the assemblies of the senate.
 (148) The practice of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> was imitated by succeeding princes; the occasional commission was established as a permanent office; and the favoured quaestor, assuming a new and more illustrious character, alone survived the suppression of his ancient and useless colleagues.
 (149) As the orations which he composed in the name of the emperor (150) acquired the force, and at length the form, of absolute edicts, he was considered as the representative of the legislative power, the oracle of the council, and the original source of the civil jurisprudence.
 He was sometimes invited to take his seat in the supreme judicature of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> consistory, with the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefects and the master of the offices; and he was frequently requested to resolve the doubts of inferior judges: but as he was not oppressed with a variety of subordinate business, his leisure and talents were employed to cultivate that dignified style of eloquence which, in the corruption of taste and language, still preserves the majesty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> laws.
 (151) In some respects the office of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> quaestor may be compared with that of a modern chancellor; but the use of a great seal, which seems to have been adopted by the illiterate barbarians, was never introduced to attest the public acts of the emperors.
 The public treasurer4.
 The extraordinary title of count of the sacred largesses was bestowed on the treasurer-general of the revenue, with the intention perhaps of inculcating that every payment flowed from the voluntary bounty of the monarch.
 To conceive the almost infinite detail of the <DATE>annual</DATE> and daily expense of the civil and military administration in every part of a great empire would exceed the powers of the most vigorous imagination.
 The actual account employed several <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> persons, distributed into <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> different offices, which were artfully contrived to examine and control their respective operations.
 The multitude of these agents had a natural tendency to increase; and it was more than once thought expedient to dismiss to their native homes the useless supernumeraries, who, deserting their honest labours, had pressed with too much eagerness into the lucrative profession of the finances.
 (152) <CARDINAL>Twenty-nine</CARDINAL> provincial receivers, of whom <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> were honoured with the title of count, corresponded with the treasurer, and he extended his jurisdiction over the mines from whence the precious metals were extracted, over the mints in which they were converted into the current coin, and over the public treasuries of the most important cities, where they were deposited for the service of the state.
 The foreign trade of the empire was regulated by this minister, who directed likewise all the linen and woollen manufactures, in which the successive operations of spinning, weaving, and dyeing were executed, chiefly by women of a servile condition, for the use of the palace and army.
 <CARDINAL>Twenty-six</CARDINAL> of these institutions are enumerated in the West, where the arts had been more recently introduced, and a still larger proportion may be allowed for the industrious provinces of the East.
 (153)The private treasurer5.
 Besides the public revenue, which an absolute monarch might levy and expend according to his pleasure, the emperors, in the capacity of opulent citizens, possessed a very extensive property, which was administered by the count or treasurer of the private estate.
 Some part had perhaps been the ancient demesnes of kings and republics; some accessions might be derived from the families which were successively invested with the purple; but the most considerable portion flowed from the impure source of confiscations and forfeitures.
 The <NORP>Imperial</NORP> estates were scattered through the provinces from <GPE>Mauritania</GPE> to Britain; but the rich and fertile soil of <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> tempted the monarch to acquire in that country his fairest possessions, (154) and either <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> or his successors embraced the occasion of justifying avarice by religious zeal.
 They suppressed the rich temple of Comana, where the high-priest of the goddess of war supported the dignity of a sovereign prince; and they applied to their private use the consecrated lands, which were inhabited by <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand subjects or slaves of the deity and her ministers.
 (155) But these were not the valuable inhabitants: the plains that stretch from the foot of Mount Argaeus to the banks of the <LOC>Sarus</LOC> bred a generous race of horses, renowned above all others in the ancient world for their majestic shape and incomparable swiftness.
 These sacred animals, destined for the service of the palace and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> games, were protected by the laws from the profanation of a vulgar master.
 (156) The demesnes of <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> were important enough to require the inspection of a count, (157) officers of an inferior rank were stationed in the other parts of the empire; and the deputies of the private, as well as those of the public treasurer, were maintained in the exercise of their independent functions, and encouraged to control the authority of the provincial magistrates.
 (158) The counts of the domestics.
6, 7.
 The chosen bands of cavalry and infantry, which guarded the person of the emperor, were under the immediate command of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> counts of the domestics.
 The whole number consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> men, divided into <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> schools, or troops, of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> each; and in the <LOC>East</LOC> this honourable service was almost entirely appropriated to the Armenians.
 Whenever, on public ceremonies, they were drawn up in the courts and porticos of the palace, their lofty stature, silent order, and splendid arms of silver and gold, displayed a martial pomp not unworthy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> majesty.
 (159) From the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> schools <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> companies of horse and foot were selected, of the protectors, whose advantageous station was the hope and reward of the most deserving soldiers.
 They mounted guard in the interior apartments, and were occasionally despatched into the provinces, to execute with celerity and vigour the orders of their master.
 (160) The counts of the domestics had succeeded to the office of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefects; like the praefects, they aspired from the service of the palace to the command of armies.
 Agents, or official spies.
 The perpetual intercourse between the court and the provinces was facilitated by the construction of roads and the institution of posts.
 But these beneficial establishments were accidentally connected with a pernicious and intolerable abuse.
 Two or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> agents or messengers were employed, under the jurisdiction of the master of the offices, to announce the names of the <DATE>annual</DATE> consuls, and the edicts or victories of the emperors.
 They insensibly assumed the licence of reporting whatever they could observe of the conduct either of magistrates or of private citizens; and were soon considered as the eyes of the monarch (161) and the scourge of the people.
 Under the warm influence of a feeble reign they multiplied to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand, disdained the mild though frequent admonitions of the laws, and exercised in the profitable management of the posts a rapacious and insolent oppression.
 These official spies, who regularly corresponded with the palace, were encouraged, by favour and reward, anxiously to watch the progress of every treasonable design, from the faint and latent symptoms of disaffection, to the actual preparation of an open revolt.
 Their careless or criminal violation of truth and justice was covered by the consecrated mask of zeal and they might securely aim their poisoned arrows at the breast either of the guilty or the innocent, who had provoked their resentment, or refused to purchase their silence.
 A faithful subject, of <GPE>Syria</GPE> perhaps, or of Britain, was exposed to the danger, or at least to the dread, of being dragged in chains to the court of <GPE>Milan</GPE> or Constantinople, to defend his life and fortune against the malicious charge of these privileged informers.
 The ordinary administration was conducted by those methods which extreme necessity can alone palliate; and the defects of evidence were diligently supplied by the use of torture.
 (162) Use of torture The deceitful and dangerous experiment of the criminal question, as it is emphatically styled, was admitted, rather than approved, in the jurisprudence of the Romans.
 They applied this sanguinary mode of examination only to servile bodies, whose sufferings were seldom weighed by those haughty <NORP>republicans</NORP> in the scale of justice or humanity; but they would never consent to violate the sacred person of a citizen till they possessed the clearest evidence of his guilt.
 (163) The annals of tyranny, from the reign of <PERSON>Tiberius</PERSON> to that of Domitian, circumstantially relate the executions of many innocent victims; but, as long as the faintest remembrance was kept alive of the national freedom and honour, the last <TIME>hours</TIME> of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> were secure from the danger of ignominious torture.
 (164) The conduct of the provincial magistrates was not, however, regulated by the practice of the city, or the strict maxims of the civilians.
 They found the use of torture established not only among the slaves of oriental despotism, but among the Macedonians, who obeyed a limited monarch; among the Rhodians, who flourished by the liberty of commerce; and even among the sage Athenians, who had asserted and adorned the dignity of human kind.
 (165) The acquiescence of the provincials encouraged their governors to acquire, or perhaps to usurp, a discretionary power of employing the rack, to extort from vagrants or plebeian criminals the confession of their guilt, till they insensibly proceeded to confound the distinctions of rank, and to disregard the privileges of <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens.
 The apprehensions of the subjects urged them to solicit, and the interest of the sovereign engaged him to grant, a variety of special exemptions, which tacitly allowed, and even authorised, the general use of torture.
 They protected all persons of illustrious or honourable rank bishops and their presbyters, professors of the liberal arts, soldiers and their families, municipal officers, and their posterity to the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> generation, and all children under the age of puberty.
 (166) But a fatal maxim was introduced into the new jurisprudence of the empire, that in the case of treason, which included every offence that the subtlety of lawyers could derive from an hostile intention towards the prince or republic, (167) all privileges were suspended, and all conditions were reduced to the same ignominious level.
 As the safety of the emperor was avowedly preferred to every consideration of justice or humanity, the dignity of age and the tenderness of youth were alike exposed to the most cruel tortures; and the terrors of a malicious information, which might select them as the accomplices, or even as the witnesses, perhaps, of an imaginary crime, perpetually hung over the heads of the principal citizens of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 (168) Finances These evils, however terrible they may appear, were confined to the smaller number of <NORP>Roman</NORP> subjects whose dangerous situation was in some degree compensated by the enjoyment of those advantages, either of nature or of fortune, which exposed them to the jealousy of the monarch.
 The obscure <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of a great empire have much less to dread from the cruelty than from the avarice of their masters; and their humble happiness is principally affected by the grievance of excessive taxes, which, gently pressing on the wealthy, descend with accelerated weight on the meaner and more indigent classes of society.
 An ingenious philosopher (169) has calculated the universal measure of the public impositions by the degrees of freedom and servitude; and ventures to assert that, according to an invariable law of nature, it must always increase with the former, and diminish in a just proportion to the latter.
 But this reflection, which would tend to alleviate the miseries of despotism, is contradicted at least by the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire; which accuses the same princes of despoiling the senate of its authority, and the provinces of their wealth.
 Without abolishing all the various customs and duties on merchandises, which are imperceptibly discharged by the apparent choice of the purchaser, the policy of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and his successors preferred a simple and direct mode of taxation, more congenial to the spirit of an arbitrary government.
 (170) The general tribute, or indiction.
 The name and use of the indictions, (171) which serve to ascertain the chronology of the middle ages, was derived from the regular practice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tributes.
 (172) The emperor subscribed with his own hand, and in purple ink, the solemn edict, or indiction, which was fixed up in the principal city of each diocese during <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months previous to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> day of September.
 And, by a very easy connection of ideas, the word indiction was transferred to the measure of tribute which it prescribed, and to the <DATE>annual</DATE> term which it allowed for the payment.
 This general estimate of the supplies was proportioned to the real and imaginary wants of the state; but as often as the expense exceeded the revenue, or the revenue fell short of the computation, an additional tax, under the name of superindiction, was imposed on the people, and the most valuable attribute of sovereignty was communicated to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefects, who, on some occasions, were permitted to provide for the unforeseen and extraordinary exigencies of the public service.
 The execution of these laws (which it would be tedious to pursue in their <TIME>minute</TIME> and intricate detail) consisted of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> distinct operations: the resolving the general imposition into its constituent parts, which were assessed on the provinces, the cities, and the individuals of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; and the collecting the separate contributions of the individuals, the cities, and the provinces, till the accumulated sums were poured into the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> treasuries.
 But as the account between the monarch and the subject was perpetually open, and as the renewal of the demand anticipated the perfect discharge of the preceding obligation, the weighty machine of the finances was moved by the same hands round the circle of its <DATE>yearly</DATE> revolution.
 Whatever was honourable or important in the administration of the revenue was committed to the wisdom of the praefects and their provincial representatives; the lucrative functions were claimed by a crowd of subordinate officers, some of whom depended on the treasurer, others on the governor of the province; and who, in the inevitable conflicts of a perplexed jurisdiction, had frequent opportunities of disputing with each other the spoils of the people.
 The laborious offices, which could be productive only of envy and reproach, of expense and danger, were imposed on the Decurions, who formed the corporations of the cities, and whom the severity of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> laws had condemned to sustain the burdens of civil society.
 (173) The whole landed property of the empire (without excepting the patrimonial estates of the monarch) was the object of ordinary taxation; and every new purchaser contracted the obligations of the former proprietor.
 An accurate census, (174) or survey, was the only equitable mode of ascertaining the proportion which every citizen should be obliged to contribute for the public service; and from the well-known period of the indictions, there is reason to believe that this difficult and expensive operation was repeated at the regular distance of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years.
 The lands were measured by surveyors, who were sent into the provinces; their nature, whether arable or pasture, or vineyards or woods, was distinctly reported; and an estimate was made of their common value from the average produce of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years.
 The numbers of slaves and cattle constituted an essential part of the report; an oath was administered to the proprietors which bound them to disclose the true state of the affairs; and their attempts to prevaricate, or elude the intention of the legislator, were severely watched, and punished as a capital crime, which included the double guilt of treason and sacrilege.
 (175) A large portion of the tribute was paid in money; and of the current coin of the empire, gold alone could be legally accepted.
 (176) The remainder of the taxes, according to the proportions determined by the <DATE>annual</DATE> indiction, was furnished in a manner still more direct, and still more oppressive.
 According to the different nature of lands, their real produce in the various articles of wine or oil, corn or barley, wood or iron, was transported by the labour or at the expense of the provincials to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> magazines, from whence they were occasionally distributed, for the use of the court, of the army, and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> capitals, <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Constantinople.
 The commissioners of the revenue were so frequently obliged to make considerable purchases, that they were strictly prohibited from allowing any compensation, or from receiving in money the value of those supplies which were exacted in kind.
 In the primitive simplicity of small communities this method may be well adapted to collect the almost voluntary offerings of the people; but it is at once susceptible of the utmost latitude and of the utmost strictness, which in a corrupt and absolute monarchy must introduce a perpetual contest between the power of oppression and the arts of fraud.
 (177) The agriculture of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces was insensibly ruined, and, in the progress of despotism, which tends to disappoint its own purpose, the emperors were obliged to derive some merit from the forgiveness of debts, or the remission of tributes, which their subjects were utterly incapable of paying.
 According to the new division of Italy, the fertile and happy province of Campania, the scene of the early victories and of the delicious retirements of the citizens of Rome, extended between the sea and the <LOC>Apennine</LOC> from the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> to the Silarus.
 Within sixty <DATE>years</DATE> after the death of Constantine, and on the evidence of an actual survey, an exemption was granted in favour of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and thirty thousand English acres of desert and uncultivated land, which amounted to <CARDINAL>one-eighth</CARDINAL> of the whole surface of the province.
 As the footsteps of the barbarians had not yet been seen in Italy, the cause of this amazing desolation, which is recorded in the laws, can be ascribed only to the administration of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors.
 (178) Assessed in the form of a capitation.
 Either from design or from accident, the mode of assessment seemed to unite the substance of a land tax with the forms of a capitation.
 (179) The returns which were sent of every province or district expressed the number of tributary subjects, and the amount of the public impositions.
 The latter of these sums was divided by the former; and the estimate, that such a province contained so many capita, or heads of tribute, and that each head was rated at such a price was universally received, not only in the popular, but even in the legal computation.
 The value of a tributary head must have varied, according to many accidental, or at least fluctuating circumstances: but some knowledge has been preserved of a very curious fact, the more important since it relates to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the richest provinces of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, and which now flourishes as the most splendid of the <NORP>European</NORP> kingdoms.
 The rapacious ministers of <ORG>Constantius</ORG> had exhausted the wealth of Gaul, by exacting <CARDINAL>twenty-five</CARDINAL> pieces of gold for the <DATE>annual</DATE> tribute of every head.
 The humane policy of his successor reduced the capitation to <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> pieces.
 (180) A moderate proportion between these opposite extremes of extraordinary oppression and of transient indulgence may therefore be fixed at <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, or about nine pounds sterling, the common standard, perhaps, of the impositions of Gaul.
 (181) But this calculation, or rather indeed the facts from whence it is deduced, cannot fail of suggesting <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> difficulties to a thinking mind, who will be at once surprised by the equality and by the enormity of the capitation.
 An attempt to explain them may perhaps reflect some light on the interesting subject of the finances of the declining empire.
I.
 It is obvious that, as long as the immutable constitution of human nature produces and maintains so unequal a division of property, the most numerous part of the community would be deprived of their subsistence by the equal assessment of a tax from which the sovereign would derive a very trifling revenue.
 Such, indeed, might be the theory of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> capitation; but, in the practice, this unjust equality was no longer felt, as the tribute was collected on the principle of a real, not of a personal imposition.
 Several indigent citizens contributed to compose a single head, or share of taxation; while the wealthy provincial, in proportion to his fortune, alone represented several of those imaginary beings.
 In a poetical request, addressed to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the last and most deserving of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes who reigned in Gaul, <PERSON>Sidonius</PERSON> Apollinaris personifies his tribute under the figure of a triple monster, the <PERSON>Geryon</PERSON> of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> fables, and entreats the new <PRODUCT>Hercules</PRODUCT> that he would most graciously be pleased to save his life by cutting off <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> of his heads.
 (182) The fortune of <PERSON>Sidonius</PERSON> far exceeded the customary wealth of a poet; but if he had pursued the allusion, he must have painted many of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> nobles with the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> heads of the deadly Hydra, spreading over the face of the country, and devouring the substance of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> families.
 II.
 The difficulty of allowing an <DATE>annual</DATE> sum of about nine pounds sterling, even for the average of the capitation of Gaul, may be rendered more evident by the comparison of the present state of the same country, as it is now governed by the absolute monarch of an industrious, wealthy, and affectionate people.
 The taxes of <GPE>France</GPE> cannot be magnified, either by fear or by flattery, beyond the <DATE>annual</DATE> amount of <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> sterling, which ought, perhaps to be shared among four-and-twenty <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of inhabitants.
 (183) <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of these, in the capacity of fathers, or brothers, or husbands, may discharge the obligations of the remaining multitude of women and children; yet the equal proportion of each tributary subject will scarcely rise above fifty shillings of our money, instead of a proportion almost <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> times as considerable, which was regularly imposed on their <NORP>Gallic</NORP> ancestors.
 The reason of this difference may be found, not so much in the relative scarcity or plenty of gold and silver, as in the different state of society in ancient <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and in modern France.
 In a country where personal freedom is the privilege of every subject, the whole mass of taxes, whether they are levied on property or on consumption, may be fairly divided among the whole body of the nation.
 But the far greater part of the lands of ancient Gaul, as well as of the other provinces of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, were cultivated by slaves, or by peasants, whose dependent condition was a less rigid servitude.
 (184) In such a state the poor were maintained at the expense of the masters who enjoyed the fruits of their labour; and as the rolls of tribute were filled only with the names of those citizens who possessed the means of an honourable, or at least of a decent subsistence, the comparative smallness of their numbers explains and justifies the high rate of their capitation.
 The truth of this assertion may be illustrated by the following example:- The Aedui, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most powerful and civilised tribes or cities of Gaul, occupied an extent of territory which now contains above <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand inhabitants, in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ecclesiastical dioceses of <GPE>Autun</GPE> and Nevers; (185) and with the probable accession of those of <GPE>Chalons</GPE> and Macon, (186) the population would amount to <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand souls.
 In the time of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the territory of the <GPE>Aedui</GPE> afforded no more than <CARDINAL>twenty-five</CARDINAL> thousand heads of capitation, of whom <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand were discharged by that prince from the intolerable weight of tribute.
 (187) A just analogy would seem to countenance the opinion of an ingenious historian, (188) that the free and tributary citizens did not surpass the number of half a million; and if, in the ordinary administration of government, their <DATE>annual</DATE> payments may be computed at about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> and a half of our money, it would appear that, although the share of each individual was <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> times as considerable, a <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> part only of the modern taxes of <GPE>France</GPE> was levied on the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> province of Gaul.
 The exactions of <ORG>Constantius</ORG> may be calculated at <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> sterling, which were reduced to <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> by the humanity or the wisdom of Julian.
 Capitation on trade and industry.
 But this tax or capitation on the proprietors of land would have suffered a rich and numerous class of free citizens to escape.
 With the view of sharing that species of wealth which is derived from art or labour, and which exists in money or in merchandise, the emperors imposed a distinct and personal tribute on the trading part of their subjects.
 (189) Some exemptions, very strictly confined both in time and place, were allowed to the proprietors who disposed of the produce of their own estates.
 Some indulgence was granted to the profession of the liberal arts; but every other branch of commercial industry was affected by the severity of the law.
 The honourable merchant of Alexandria, who imported the gems and spices of <GPE>India</GPE> for the use of the western world; the usurer, who derived from the interest of money a silent and ignominious profit, the ingenious manufacturer, the diligent mechanic, and even the most obscure retailer of a sequestered village, were obliged to admit the officers of the revenue into the partnership of their gain; and the sovereign of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, who tolerated the profession, consented to share the infamous salary of public prostitutes.
 As this general tax upon industry was collected every <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> year, it was styled the Lustral Contribution: and the historian <PERSON>Zosimus</PERSON> (190) laments that the approach of the fatal period was announced by the tears and terrors of the citizens, who were often compelled by the impending scourge to embrace the most abhorred and unnatural methods of procuring the sum at which their poverty had been assessed.
 The testimony of <PERSON>Zosimus</PERSON> cannot indeed be justified from the charge of passion and prejudice; but, from the nature of this tribute, it seems reasonable to conclude that it was arbitrary in the distribution, and extremely rigorous in the mode of collecting.
 The secret wealth of commerce, and the precarious profits of art or labour, are susceptible only of a discretionary valuation, which is seldom disadvantageous to the interest of the treasury; and as the person of the trader supplies the want of a visible and permanent security, the payment of the imposition, which, in the case of a land-tax, may be obtained by the seizure of property, can rarely be extorted by any other means than those of corporal punishments.
 The cruel treatment of the insolvent debtors of the state is attested, and was perhaps mitigated, by a very humane edict of Constantine, who, disclaiming the use of racks and of scourges, allots a spacious and airy prison for the place of their confinement.
 (191) Free gifts.
 These general taxes were imposed and levied by the absolute authority of the monarch; but the occasional offerings of the coronary gold still retained the name and semblance of popular consent.
 It was an ancient custom that the allies of the republic, who ascribed their safety or deliverance to the success of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms, and even the cities of Italy, who admired the virtues of their victorious general, adorned the pomp of his triumph by their voluntary gifts of crowns of gold, which, after the ceremony, were consecrated in the temple of Jupiter, to remain a lasting monument of his glory to future ages.
 The progress of zeal and flattery soon multiplied the number, and increased the size, of these popular donations; and the triumph of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> was enriched with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty-two massy crowns, whose weight amounted to <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> pounds of gold.
 This treasure was immediately melted down by the prudent dictator, who was satisfied that it would be more serviceable to his soldiers than to the gods: his example was imitated by his successors, and the custom was introduced of exchanging these splendid ornaments for the more acceptable present of the current gold coin of the empire.
 (192) The spontaneous offering was at length exacted as the debt of duty, and, instead of being confined to the occasion of a triumph, it was supposed to be granted by the several cities and provinces of the monarchy as often as the emperor condescended to announce his accession, his consulship, the birth of a son, the creation of a Caesar, a victory over the barbarians, or any other real or imaginary event which graced the annals of his reign.
 The peculiar free gift of the senate of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was fixed by custom at <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, or about <CARDINAL>sixty-four</CARDINAL> thousand pounds sterling.
 The oppressed subjects celebrated their own felicity that their sovereign should graciously consent to accept this feeble but voluntary testimony of their loyalty and gratitude.
 (193) Conclusion A people elated by pride, or soured by discontent, is seldom qualified to form a just estimate of their actual situation.
 The subjects of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were incapable of discerning the decline of genius and manly virtue, which so far degraded them below the dignity of their ancestors; but they could feel and lament the rage of tyranny, the relaxation of discipline, and the increase of taxes.
 The impartial historian, who acknowledges the justice of their complaints, will observe some favourable circumstances which tended to alleviate the misery of their condition.
 The threatening tempest of barbarians, which so soon subverted the foundations of <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness, was still repelled, or suspended, on the frontiers.
 The arts of luxury and literature were cultivated, and the elegant pleasures of society were enjoyed, by the inhabitants of a considerable portion of the globe.
 The forms, the pomp, and the expense of the civil administration contributed to restrain the irregular licence of the soldiers; and although the laws were violated by power, or perverted by subtlety, the sage principles of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence preserved a sense of order and equity unknown to the despotic governments of the East.
 The rights of mankind might derive some protection from religion and philosophy; and the name of freedom, which could no longer alarm, might sometimes admonish, the successors of Augustus, that they did not reign over a nation of <NORP>Slaves</NORP> or Barbarians.
