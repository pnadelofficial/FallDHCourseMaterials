 A ray of historic light seems to beam from the darkness of the tenth century.
 Works of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> <PERSON>Porphyrogenitus</PERSON> We open with curiosity and respect the royal volumes of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> Porphyrogenitus, (1) which he composed at a mature age for the instruction of his son, and which promise to unfold the state of the eastern empire, both in peace and war, both at home and abroad.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these works he minutely describes the pompous ceremonies of the church and palace of Constantinople, according to his own practice, and that of his predecessors.
 (2) In the second, he attempts an accurate survey of the provinces, the themes, as they were then denominated, both of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia.
 (3) The system of <NORP>Roman</NORP> tactics, the discipline and order of the troops, and the military operations by land and sea, are explained in the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of these didactic collections, which may be ascribed to <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> or his father Leo.
 (4) In the fourth, of the administration of the empire, he reveals the secrets of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> policy, in friendly or hostile intercourse with the nations of the earth.
 The literary labours of the age, the practical systems of law, agriculture, and history, might redound to the benefit of the subject and the honour of the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> princes.
 The <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> books of the Basilics, (5) the code and pandects of civil jurisprudence, were gradually framed in the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> reigns of that prosperous dynasty.
 The art of agriculture had amused the leisure, and exercised the pens, of the best and wisest of the ancients; and their chosen precepts are comprised in the <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> books of the <PERSON>Geoponics</PERSON> (6) of Constantine.
 At his command, the historical examples of vice and virtue were methodized in <CARDINAL>fifty-three</CARDINAL> books, (7) and every citizen might apply, to his contemporaries or himself, the lesson or the warning of past times.
 From the august character of a legislator, the sovereign of the <LOC>East</LOC> descends to the more humble office of a teacher and a scribe; and if his successors and subjects were regardless of his paternal cares, we may inherit and enjoy the everlasting legacy.
 Their imperfections.
 A closer survey will indeed reduce the value of the gift, and the gratitude of posterity: in the possession of these <ORG>Imperial</ORG> treasures we may still deplore our poverty and ignorance; and the fading glories of their authors will be obliterated by indifference or contempt.
 The <NORP>Basilics</NORP> will sink to a broken copy, a partial and mutilated version, in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language, of the laws of Justinian; but the sense of the old civilians is often superseded by the influence of bigotry: and the absolute prohibition of divorce, concubinage, and interest for money, enslaves the freedom of trade and the happiness of private life.
 In the historical book, a subject of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> might admire the inimitable virtues of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Rome: he might learn to what a pitch of energy and elevation the human character had formerly aspired.
 But a contrary effect must have been produced by a new edition of the lives of the saints, which the great logothete, or chancellor of the empire, was directed to prepare; and the dark fund of superstition was enriched by the fabulous and florid legends of Simon the Metaphrast.
 (8) The merits and miracles of the whole calendar are of less account in the eyes of a sage, than the toil of a single husbandman, who multiplies the gifts of the Creator, and supplies the food of his brethren.
 Yet the royal authors of the <PERSON>Geoponics</PERSON> were more seriously employed in expounding the precepts of the destroying art, which had been taught since the days of Xenophon, (9) as the art of heroes and kings.
 But the Tactics of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> are mingled with the baser alloy of the age in which they lived.
 It was destitute of original genius; they implicitly transcribe the rules and maxims which had been confirmed by victories.
 It was unskilled in the propriety of style and method; they blindly confound the most distant and discordant institutions, the phalanx of <GPE>Sparta</GPE> and that of Macedon, the legions of <PERSON>Cato</PERSON> and Trajan, of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Theodosius.
 Even the use, or at least the importance, of these military rudiments may be fairly questioned: their general theory is dictated by reason; but the merit, as well as difficulty, consists in the application.
 The discipline of a soldier is formed by exercise rather than by study: the talents of a commander are appropriated to those calm, though rapid, minds, which nature produces to decide the fate of armies and nations: the former is the habit of a life, the latter the glance of a moment; and the battles won by lessons of tactics may be numbered with the epic poems created from the rules of criticism.
 The book of ceremonies is a recital, tedious yet imperfect, of the despicable pageantry which had infected the church and state since the gradual decay of the purity of the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> and the power of the other.
 A review of the themes or provinces might promise such authentic and useful information, as the curiosity of government only can obtain, instead of traditionary fables on the origin of the cities, and malicious epigrams on the vices of their inhabitants.
 (10) Such information the historian would have been pleased to record; nor should his silence be condemned if the most interesting objects, the population of the capital and provinces, the amount of the taxes and revenues, the numbers of subjects and strangers who served under the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> standard, have been unnoticed by <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the philosopher, and his son Constantine.
 His treatise of the public administration is stained with the same blemishes; yet it is discriminated by peculiar merit; the antiquities of the nations may be doubtful or fabulous; but the geography and manners of the <NORP>Barbaric</NORP> world are delineated with curious accuracy.
 Of these nations, the <NORP>Franks</NORP> alone were qualified to observe in their turn, and to describe, the metropolis of the East.
 Embassy of Liutprand.
 The ambassador of the great Otho, a bishop of Cremona, has painted the state of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> about the middle of the tenth century: his style is glowing, his narrative lively, his observation keen; and even the prejudices and passions of <PERSON>Liutprand</PERSON> are stamped with an original character of freedom and genius.
 (11) From this scanty fund of foreign and domestic materials, I shall investigate the form and substance of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire; the provinces and wealth, the civil government and military force, the character and literature, of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> in a period of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred years, from the reign of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> to his successful invasion of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> or Latins.
 The themes and provinces of the empire, and its limits in every age.
 After the final division between the sons of Theodosius, the swarms of <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> from <GPE>Scythia</GPE> and <GPE>Germany</GPE> over-spread the provinces and extinguished the empire of ancient Rome.
 The weakness of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was concealed by extent of dominion: her limits were inviolate, or at least entire; and the kingdom of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was enlarged by the splendid acquisition of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Italy.
 But the possession of these new conquests was transient and precarious; and almost a moiety of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire was torn away by the arms of the Saracens.
 <GPE>Syria</GPE> and <GPE>Egypt</GPE> were oppressed by the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> caliphs; and, after the reduction of Africa, their lieutenants invaded and subdued the <NORP>Roman</NORP> province which had been changed into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> monarchy of Spain.
 The islands of the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> were not inaccessible to their naval powers; and it was from their extreme stations, the harbours of <GPE>Crete</GPE> and the fortresses of Cilicia, that the faithful or rebel emirs insulted the majesty of the throne and capital.
 The remaining provinces, under the obedience of the emperors, were cast into a new mould; and the jurisdiction of the presidents, the consulars, and the counts were superseded by the institution of the themes, (12) or military governments, which prevailed under the successors of Heraclius, and are described by the pen of the royal author.
 Of the <CARDINAL>twenty-nine</CARDINAL> themes, <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> in Asia, the origin is obscure, the etymology doubtful or capricious: the limits were arbitrary and fluctuating; but some particular names, that sound the most strangely to our ear, were derived from the character and attributes of the troops that were maintained at the expense, and for the guard, of the respective divisions.
 The vanity of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes most eagerly grasped the shadow of conquest and the memory of lost dominion.
 A new <LOC>Mesopotamia</LOC> was created on the western side of the Euphrates: the appellation and praetor of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> were transferred to a narrow slip of Calabria; and a fragment of the duchy of <PERSON>Beneventum</PERSON> was promoted to the style and title of the theme of Lombardy.
 In the decline of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> empire, the successors of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> might indulge their pride in more solid advantages.
 The victories of Nicephorus, John Zimisces, and <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> the Second, revived the fame, and enlarged the boundaries, of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name: the province of Cilicia, the metropolis of Antioch, the islands of <GPE>Crete</GPE> and Cyprus, were restored to the allegiance of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and Caesar: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was annexed to the throne of Constantinople: the kingdom of <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> was destroyed; and the last sovereigns of the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> dynasty extended their sway from the sources of the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> to the neighbourhood of Rome.
 In the eleventh century, the prospect was again clouded by new enemies and new misfortunes: the relics of <GPE>Italy</GPE> were swept away by the <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> adventures; and almost all the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> branches were dissevered from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> trunk by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> conquerors.
 After these losses, the emperors of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family continued to reign from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to Peloponesus, and from <GPE>Belgrade</GPE> to Nice, Trebizond, and the winding stream of the Meander.
 The spacious provinces of Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece, were obedient to their sceptre; the possession of Cyprus, Rhodes, and Crete, was accompanied by the <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> islands of the <LOC>Aegean</LOC> or Holy Sea; (13) and the remnant of their empire transcends the measure of the largest of the <NORP>European</NORP> kingdoms.
 General wealth and populousness.
 The same princes might assert, with dignity and truth, that of all the monarchs of <LOC>Christendom</LOC> they possessed the greatest city, (14) the most ample revenue, the most flourishing and populous state.
 With the decline and fall of the empire, the cities of the <LOC>West</LOC> had decayed and fallen; nor could the ruins of Rome, or the mud walls, wooden hovels, and narrow precincts of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and London, prepare the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> stranger to contemplate the situation and extent of Constantinople, her stately palaces and churches, and the arts and luxury of an innumerable people.
 Her treasures might attract, but her virgin strength had repelled, and still promised to repel, the audacious invasion of the <LANGUAGE>Persian</LANGUAGE> and Bulgarian, the <NORP>Arab</NORP> and the Russian.
 The provinces were less fortunate and impregnable; and few districts, few cities, could be discovered which had not been violated by some fierce Barbarian, impatient to despoil, because he was hopeless to possess.
 From the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire was sinking below its former level; the powers of destruction were more active than those of improvement; and the calamities of war were embittered by the more permanent evils of civil and ecclesiastical tyranny.
 The captive who had escaped from the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> was often stripped and imprisoned by the ministers of his sovereign: the <NORP>Greek</NORP> superstition relaxed the mind by prayer, and emaciated the body by fasting; and the multitude of convents and festivals diverted many hands and many days from the temporal service of mankind.
 Yet the subjects of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire were still the most dexterous and diligent of nations; their country was blessed by nature with every advantage of soil, climate, and situation; and, in the support and restoration of the arts, their patient and peaceful temper was more useful than the warlike spirit and feudal anarchy of Europe.
 The provinces that still adhered to the empire were repeopled and enriched by the misfortunes of those which were irrecoverably lost.
 From the yoke of the caliphs, the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> of Syria, Egypt, and <LOC>Africa</LOC> retired to the allegiance of their prince, to the society of their brethren: the movable wealth, which eludes the search of oppression, accompanied and alleviated their exile, and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> received into her bosom the fugitive trade of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> and Tyre.
 The chiefs of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and Scythia, who fled from hostile or religious persecution, were hospitably entertained: their followers were encouraged to build new cities and to cultivate waste lands; and many spots, both in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, preserved the name, the manners, or at least the memory, of these national colonies.
 Even the tribes of Barbarians, who had seated themselves in arms on the territory of the empire, were gradually reclaimed to the laws of the church and state; and as long as they were separated from the Greeks, their posterity supplied a race of faithful and obedient soldiers.
 Did we possess sufficient materials to survey the <CARDINAL>twenty-nine</CARDINAL> themes of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> monarchy, our curiosity might be satisfied with a chosen example: it is fortunate enough that the clearest light should be thrown on the most interesting province, and the name of <GPE>Peloponesus</GPE> will awaken the attention of the classic reader.
 State of Peloponesus: Sclavonians.
 As early as the eighth century, in the troubled reign of the Iconoclasts, Greece, and even PELOPONESUS, (15) were overrun by some <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> bands who outstripped the royal standard of Bulgaria.
 The strangers of old, Cadmus, and Danaus, and Pelops, had planted in that fruitful soil the seeds of policy and learning; but the savages of the north eradicated what yet remained of their sickly and withered roots.
 In this irruption, the country and the inhabitants were transformed; the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> blood was contaminated; and the proudest nobles of <GPE>Peloponesus</GPE> were branded with the names of foreigners and slaves.
 By the diligence of succeeding princes, the land was in some measure purified from the Barbarians; and the humble remnant was bound by an oath of obedience, tribute, and military service, which they often renewed and often violated.
 The siege of <GPE>Patras</GPE> was formed by a singular concurrence of the <NORP>Sclavonians</NORP> of <GPE>Peloponesus</GPE> and the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Africa.
 In their last distress, a pious fiction of the approach of the praetor of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> revived the courage of the citizens.
 Their sally was bold and successful; the strangers embarked, the rebels submitted, and the glory of the day was ascribed to a phantom or a stranger, who fought in the foremost ranks under the character of St.
 Andrew the Apostle.
 The shrine which contained his relics was decorated with the trophies of victory, and the captive race was forever devoted to the service and vassalage of the metropolitan church of Patras.
 By the revolt of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> tribes, in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Helos</GPE> and Lacedaemon, the peace of the peninsula was often disturbed.
 They sometimes insulted the weakness, and sometimes resisted the oppression, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> government, till at length the approach of their hostile brethren extorted a golden bull to define the rites and obligations of the <NORP>Ezzerites</NORP> and Milengi, whose <DATE>annual</DATE> tribute was defined at <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of gold.
 From these strangers the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> geographer has accurately distinguished a domestic, and perhaps original, race, who, in some degree, might derive their blood from the much-injured Helots.
 Freemen of Laconia.
 The liberality of the Romans, and especially of Augustus, had enfranchised the maritime cities from the dominion of Sparta; and the continuance of the same benefit ennobled them with the title of Eleuthero-, or Free- Laconians.
 (16) In the time of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> Porphyrogenitus, they had acquired the name of Mainotes, under which they dishonour the claim of liberty by the inhuman pillage of all that is shipwrecked on their rocky shores.
 Their territory, barren of corn, but fruitful of olives, extended to the Cape of Malea: they accepted a chief or prince from the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> praetor, and a light tribute of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of gold was the badge of their immunity, rather than of their dependence.
 The freemen of <GPE>Laconia</GPE> assumed the character of Romans, and long adhered to the religion of the Greeks.
 By the zeal of the emperor Basil, they were baptized in the faith of Christ: but the altars of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and <LOC>Neptune</LOC> had been crowned by these rustic votaries <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred years after they were proscribed in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 Cities and revenue of Peloponesus.
 In the theme of Peloponesus, (17) <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> cities were still numbered, and the declining state of Sparta, Argos, and Corinth, may be suspended in the tenth century, at an equal distance, perhaps, between their antique splendour and their present desolation.
 The duty of military service, either in person or by substitute, was imposed on the lands or benefices of the province; a sum of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> pieces of gold was assessed on each of the substantial tenants; and the same capitation was shared among several heads of inferior value.
 On the proclamation of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> war, the <NORP>Peloponesians</NORP> excused themselves by a voluntary oblation of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pounds of gold, (four thousand pounds sterling,) and a thousand horses with their arms and trappings.
 The churches and monasteries furnished their contingent; a sacrilegious profit was extorted from the sale of ecclesiastical honours; and the indigent bishop of <ORG>Leucadia</ORG> (18) was made responsible for a pension of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of gold.
 (19) Manufactures, especially of silk.
 But the wealth of the province, and the trust of the revenue, were founded on the fair and plentiful produce of trade and manufacturers; and some symptoms of liberal policy may be traced in a law which exempts from all personal taxes the mariners of Peloponesus, and the workmen in parchment and purple.
 This denomination may be fairly applied or extended to the manufacturers of linen, woollen, and more especially of silk: the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former of which had flourished in <GPE>Greece</GPE> since the days of Homer; and the last was introduced perhaps as early as the reign of Justinian.
 These arts, which were exercised at Corinth, Thebes, and Argos, afforded food and occupation to a numerous people: the men, women, and children were distributed according to their age and strength; and, if many of these were domestic slaves, their masters, who directed the work and enjoyed the profit, were of a free and honourable condition.
 The gifts which a rich and generous matron of <GPE>Peloponesus</GPE> presented to the emperor Basil, her adopted son, were doubtless fabricated in the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> looms.
 <PERSON>Danielis</PERSON> bestowed a carpet of fine wool, of a pattern which imitated the spots of a peacock's tail, of a magnitude to overspread the floor of a new church, erected in the triple name of Christ, of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the archangel, and of the prophet Elijah.
 She gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of silk and linen, of various use and denomination: the silk was painted with the <NORP>Tyrian</NORP> dye, and adorned by the labours of the needle; and the linen was so exquisitely fine, that an entire piece might be rolled in the hollow of a cane.
 (20) In his description of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> manufactures, an historian of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> discriminates their price, according to the weight and quality of the silk, the closeness of the texture, the beauty of the colours, and the taste and materials of the embroidery.
 A single, or even a double or treble thread was thought sufficient for ordinary sale; but the union of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> threads composed a piece of stronger and more costly workmanship.
 Among the colours, he celebrates, with affectation of eloquence, the fiery blaze of the scarlet, and the softer lustre of the green.
 The embroidery was raised either in silk or gold: the more simple ornament of stripes or circles was surpassed by the nicer imitation of flowers: the vestments that were fabricated for the palace or the altar often glittered with precious stones; and the figures were delineated in strings of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> pearls.
 (21) Till the twelfth century, <GPE>Greece</GPE> alone, of all the countries of Christendom, was possessed of the insect who is taught by nature, and of the workmen who are instructed by art, to prepare this elegant luxury.
 But the secret had been stolen by the dexterity and diligence of the Arabs: the caliphs of the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> scorned to borrow from the unbelievers their furniture and apparel; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> cities of Spain, <GPE>Almeria</GPE> and Lisbon, were famous for the manufacture, the use, and, perhaps, the exportation, of silk.
transported from <GPE>Greece</GPE> to Sicily.
 It was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> introduced into <GPE>Sicily</GPE> by the Normans; and this emigration of trade distinguishes the victory of <PERSON>Roger</PERSON> from the uniform and fruitless hostilities of every age.
 After the sack of Corinth, Athens, and Thebes, his lieutenant embarked with a captive train of weavers and artificers of both sexes, a trophy glorious to their master, and disgraceful to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 (22) The king of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was not insensible of the value of the present; and, in the restitution of the prisoners, he excepted only the male and female manufacturers of <GPE>Thebes</GPE> and Corinth, who labor, says the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian, under a barbarous lord, like the old <NORP>Eretrians</NORP> in the service of Darius.
 (23) A stately edifice, in the palace of Palermo, was erected for the use of this industrious colony; (24) and the art was propagated by their children and disciples to satisfy the increasing demand of the western world.
 The decay of the looms of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> may be ascribed to the troubles of the island, and the competition of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> cities.
 In the year thirteen hundred and fourteen, <PERSON>Lucca</PERSON> alone, among her sister republics, enjoyed the lucrative monopoly.
 (25) A domestic revolution dispersed the manufacturers to Florence, Bologna, Venice, Milan, and even the countries beyond the Alps; and thirteen years after this event the statutes of <GPE>Modena</GPE> enjoin the planting of mulberry-trees, and regulate the duties on raw silk.
 (26) The northern climates are less propitious to the education of the silkworm; but the industry of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>England</GPE> (27) is supplied and enriched by the productions of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and China.
 Revenue of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire.
 I must repeat the complaint that the vague and scanty memorials of the times will not afford any just estimate of the taxes, the revenue, and the resources of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire.
 From every province of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> the rivulets of gold and silver discharged into the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> reservoir a copious and perennial stream.
 The separation of the branches from the trunk increased the relative magnitude of Constantinople; and the maxims of despotism contracted the state to the capital, the capital to the palace, and the palace to the royal person.
 A <NORP>Jewish</NORP> traveller, who visited the <LOC>East</LOC> in the twelfth century, is lost in his admiration of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> riches.
 In all pecuniary matters, the authority of a <NORP>Jew</NORP> is doubtless respectable; but as the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty-five days would produce a yearly income exceeding <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> sterling, I am tempted to retrench at least the numerous festivals of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> calendar.
 The mass of treasure that was saved by <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> and <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> will suggest a splendid, though indefinite, idea of their supplies and resources.
 The mother of Michael, before she retired to a cloister, attempted to check or expose the prodigality of her ungrateful son, by a free and faithful account of the wealth which he inherited; <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and nine thousand pounds of gold, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred thousand of silver, the fruits of her own economy and that of her deceased husband.
 (29) The avarice of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> is not less renowned than his valour and fortune: his victorious armies were paid and rewarded without breaking into the mass of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pounds of gold, (about <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> sterling,) which he had buried in the subterraneous vaults of the palace.
 (30) Such accumulation of treasure is rejected by the theory and practice of modern policy; and we are more apt to compute the national riches by the use and abuse of the public credit.
 Yet the maxims of antiquity are still embraced by a monarch formidable to his enemies; by a republic respectable to her allies; and both have attained their respective ends of military power and domestic tranquillity.
 Pomp and luxury of the emperors.
 Whatever might be consumed for the present wants, or reserved for the future use, of the state, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most sacred demand was for the pomp and pleasure of the emperor, and his discretion only could define the measure of his private expense.
 The princes of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> were far removed from the simplicity of nature; yet, with the revolving seasons, they were led by taste or fashion to withdraw to a purer air, from the smoke and tumult of the capital.
 They enjoyed, or affected to enjoy, the rustic festival of the vintage: their leisure was amused by the exercise of the chase and the calmer occupation of fishing, and in the <DATE>summer</DATE> heats, they were shaded from the sun, and refreshed by the cooling breezes from the sea.
 The coasts and islands of <LOC>Asia</LOC> and <LOC>Europe</LOC> were covered with their magnificent villas; but, instead of the modest art which secretly strives to hide itself and to decorate the scenery of nature, the marble structure of their gardens served only to expose the riches of the lord, and the labours of the architect.
 The successive casualties of inheritance and forfeiture had rendered the sovereign proprietor of many stately houses in the city and suburbs, of which <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> were appropriated to the ministers of state; The palace of Constantinople.
 but the great palace, (31) the centre of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> residence, was fixed during eleven centuries to the same position, between the hippodrome, the cathedral of St.
 Sophia, and the gardens, which descended by many a terrace to the shores of the Propontis.
 The primitive edifice of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was a copy, or rival, of ancient Rome; the gradual improvements of his successors aspired to emulate the wonders of the old world, (32) and in the tenth century, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace excited the admiration, at least of the Latins, by an unquestionable preeminence of strength, size, and magnificence.
 (33) But the toil and treasure of so many ages had produced a vast and irregular pile: each separate building was marked with the character of the times and of the founder; and the want of space might excuse the reigning monarch, who demolished, perhaps with secret satisfaction, the works of his predecessors.
 The economy of the emperor <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> allowed a more free and ample scope for his domestic luxury and splendour.
 A favourite ambassador, who had astonished the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> themselves by his pride and liberality, presented on his return the model of a palace, which the caliph of <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> had recently constructed on the banks of the Tigris.
 The model was instantly copied and surpassed: the new buildings of <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> (34) were accompanied with gardens, and with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> churches, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of which was conspicuous for size and beauty: it was crowned with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> domes, the roof of gilt brass reposed on columns of <NORP>Italian</NORP> marble, and the walls were encrusted with marbles of various colours.
 In the face of the church, a semicircular portico, of the figure and name of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> sigma, was supported by <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> columns of <NORP>Phrygian</NORP> marble, and the subterraneous vaults were of a similar construction.
 The square before the sigma was decorated with a fountain, and the margin of the basin was lined and encompassed with plates of silver.
 In the beginning of each season, the basin, instead of water, was replenished with the most exquisite fruits, which were abandoned to the populace for the entertainment of the prince.
 He enjoyed this tumultuous spectacle from a throne resplendent with gold and gems, which was raised by a marble staircase to the height of a lofty terrace.
 Below the throne were seated the officers of his guards, the magistrates, the chiefs of the factions of the circus; the inferior steps were occupied by the people, and the place below was covered with troops of dancers, singers, and pantomimes.
 The square was surrounded by the hall of justice, the arsenal, and the various offices of business and pleasure; and the purple chamber was named from the <DATE>annual</DATE> distribution of robes of scarlet and purple by the hand of the empress herself.
 The long series of the apartments was adapted to the seasons, and decorated with marble and porphyry, with painting, sculpture, and mosaics, with a profusion of gold, silver, and precious stones.
 His fanciful magnificence employed the skill and patience of such artists as the times could afford: but the taste of <GPE>Athens</GPE> would have despised their frivolous and costly labours; a golden tree, with its leaves and branches, which sheltered a multitude of birds warbling their artificial notes, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> lions of massy gold, and of natural size, who looked and roared like their brethren of the forest.
 The successors of Theophilus, of the <NORP>Basilian</NORP> and <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasties, were not less ambitious of leaving some memorial of their residence; and the portion of the palace most splendid and august was dignified with the title of the golden triclinium.
 (35) Furniture and attendants.
 With becoming modesty, the rich and noble <NORP>Greeks</NORP> aspired to imitate their sovereign, and when they passed through the streets on horseback, in their robes of silk and embroidery, they were mistaken by the children for kings.
 (36) A matron of Peloponesus, (37) who had cherished the infant fortunes of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> the Macedonian, was excited by tenderness or vanity to visit the greatness of her adopted son.
 In a journey of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles from <GPE>Patras</GPE> to Constantinople, her age or indolence declined the fatigue of a horse or carriage: the soft litter or bed of <PERSON>Danielis</PERSON> was transported on the shoulders of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> robust slaves; and as they were relieved at easy distances, a band of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred were selected for the performance of this service.
 She was entertained in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace with filial reverence, and the honours of a queen; and whatever might be the origin of her wealth, her gifts were not unworthy of the regal dignity.
 I have already described the fine and curious manufactures of Peloponesus, of linen, silk, and woollen; but the most acceptable of her presents consisted in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred beautiful youths, of whom <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred were eunuchs; (38) During her lifetime, she bestowed the greater part of her estates in Peloponesus, and her testament instituted Leo, the son of Basil, her universal heir.
 After the payment of the legacies, fourscore villas or farms were added to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> domain; and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand slaves of <PERSON>Danielis</PERSON> were enfranchised by their new lord, and transplanted as a colony to the <NORP>Italian</NORP> coast.
 From this example of a private matron, we may estimate the wealth and magnificence of the emperors.
 Yet our enjoyments are confined by a narrow circle; and, whatsoever may be its value, the luxury of life is possessed with more innocence and safety by the master of his own, than by the steward of the public, fortune.
 Honours and titles of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> family.
 In an absolute government, which levels the distinctions of noble and plebeian birth, the sovereign is the sole fountain of honour; and the rank, both in the palace and the empire, depends on the titles and offices which are bestowed and resumed by his arbitrary will.
 Above a thousand years, from <NORP>Vespasian</NORP> to <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> Comnenus, (39) the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> person, or at least the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> degree, after the supreme title of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> was more freely communicated to the sons and brothers of the reigning monarch.
 To elude without violating his promise to a powerful associate, the husband of his sister, and, without giving himself an equal, to reward the piety of his brother Isaac, the crafty <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> interposed a new and supereminent dignity.
 The happy flexibility of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> tongue allowed him to compound the names of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Emperor (Sebastos and Autocrator,) and the union produces the sonorous title of Sebastocrator.
 He was exalted above the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> step of the throne: the public acclamations repeated his name; and he was only distinguished from the sovereign by some peculiar ornaments of the head and feet.
 The emperor alone could assume the purple or red buskins, and the close diadem or tiara, which imitated the fashion of the <LANGUAGE>Persian</LANGUAGE> kings.
 (40) It was a high pyramidal cap of cloth or silk, almost concealed by a profusion of pearls and jewels: the crown was formed by a horizontal circle and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> arches of gold: at the summit, the point of their intersection, was placed a globe or cross, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> strings or lappets of pearl depended on either cheek.
 Instead of red, the buskins of the <CARDINAL>Sebastocrator</CARDINAL> and <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> were green; and on their open coronets or crowns, the precious gems were more sparingly distributed.
 Beside and below the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the fancy of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> created the <NORP>Panhypersebastos</NORP> and the Protosebastos, whose sound and signification will satisfy a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> ear.
 They imply a superiority and a priority above the simple name of Augustus; and this sacred and primitive title of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> prince was degraded to the kinsmen and servants of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The daughter of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> applauds, with fond complacency, this artful gradation of hopes and honours; but the science of words is accessible to the meanest capacity; and this vain dictionary was easily enriched by the pride of his successors.
 To their favourite sons or brothers, they imparted the more lofty appellation of Lord or Despot, which was illustrated with new ornaments, and prerogatives, and placed immediately after the person of the emperor himself.
 The <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> titles of, 1.
 Despot; <CARDINAL>2.
</CARDINAL> Sebastocrator; 3.
 Caesar; 4.
 Panhypersebastos; and, 5.
 Protosebastos; were usually confined to the princes of his blood: they were the emanations of his majesty; but as they exercised no regular functions, their existence was useless, and their authority precarious.
 Offices of the palace, the state, and the army.
 But in every monarchy the substantial powers of government must be divided and exercised by the ministers of the palace and treasury, the fleet and army.
 The titles alone can differ; and in the revolution of ages, the counts and praefects, the praetor and quaestor, insensibly descended, while their servants rose above their heads to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> honours of the state.
 1.
 In a monarchy, which refers every object to the person of the prince, the care and ceremonies of the palace form the most respectable department.
 The Curopalata, (41) so illustrious in the age of Justinian, was supplanted by the Protovestiare, whose primitive functions were limited to the custody of the wardrobe.
 From thence his jurisdiction was extended over the numerous menials of pomp and luxury; and he presided with his silver wand at the public and private audience.
 <CARDINAL>2.
</CARDINAL> In the ancient system of Constantine, the name of Logothete, or accountant, was applied to the receivers of the finances: the principal officers were distinguished as the <PERSON>Logothetes</PERSON> of the domain, of the posts, the army, the private and public treasure; and the great Logothete, the supreme guardian of the laws and revenues, is compared with the chancellor of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> monarchies.
 (42) His discerning eye pervaded the civil administration; and he was assisted, in due subordination, by the eparch or praefect of the city, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> secretary, and the keepers of the privy seal, the archives, and the red or purple ink which was reserved for the sacred signature of the emperor alone.
 (43) The introductor and interpreter of foreign ambassadors were the great <PERSON>Chiauss</PERSON> (44) and the Dragoman, (45) <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> names of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> origin, and which are still familiar to the Sublime Porte.
 3.
 From the humble style and service of guards, the Domestics insensibly rose to the station of generals; the military themes of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, the legions of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, were often divided, till the great <NORP>Domestic</NORP> was finally invested with the universal and absolute command of the land forces.
 The Protostrator, in his original functions, was the assistant of the emperor when he mounted on horseback: he gradually became the lieutenant of the great <NORP>Domestic</NORP> in the field; and his jurisdiction extended over the stables, the cavalry, and the royal train of hunting and hawking.
 The <PERSON>Stratopedarch</PERSON> was the great judge of the camp: the <PERSON>Protospathaire</PERSON> commanded the guards; the Constable, (46) the great Aeteriarch, and the Acolyth, were the separate chiefs of the Franks, the Barbarians, and the Varangi, or English, the mercenary strangers, who, a the decay of the national spirit, formed the nerve of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> armies.
 4.
 The naval powers were under the command of the great Duke; in his absence they obeyed the great <PERSON>Drungaire</PERSON> of the fleet; and, in his place, the Emir, or Admiral, a name of <NORP>Saracen</NORP> extraction, (47) but which has been naturalized in all the modern languages of Europe.
 Of these officers, and of many more whom it would be useless to enumerate, the civil and military hierarchy was framed.
 Their honours and emoluments, their dress and titles, their mutual salutations and respective preeminence, were balanced with more exquisite labor than would have fixed the constitution of a free people; and the code was almost perfect when this baseless fabric, the monument of pride and servitude, was forever buried in the ruins of the empire.
 (48) Adoration of the emperor.
 The most lofty titles, and the most humble postures, which devotion has applied to the Supreme Being, have been prostituted by flattery and fear to creatures of the same nature with ourselves.
 The mode of adoration, (49) of falling prostrate on the ground, and kissing the feet of the emperor, was borrowed by <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> from <LANGUAGE>Persian</LANGUAGE> servitude; but it was continued and aggravated till the last age of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarchy.
 Excepting only on Sundays, when it was waived, from a motive of religious pride, Reception of ambassadors.
 this humiliating reverence was exacted from all who entered the royal presence, from the princes invested with the diadem and purple, and from the ambassadors who represented their independent sovereigns, the caliphs of Asia, Egypt, or Spain, the kings of <GPE>France</GPE> and Italy, and the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> emperors of ancient Rome.
 In his transactions of business, Liutprand, bishop of Cremona, (50) asserted the free spirit of a <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> and the dignity of his master Otho.
 Yet his sincerity cannot disguise the abasement of his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> audience.
 When he approached the throne, the birds of the golden tree began to warble their notes, which were accompanied by the roarings of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> lions of gold.
 With his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> companions <PERSON>Liutprand</PERSON> was compelled to bow and to fall prostrate; and thrice to touch the ground with his forehead.
 He arose, but in the short interval, the throne had been hoisted from the floor to the ceiling, the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> figure appeared in new and more gorgeous apparel, and the interview was concluded in haughty and majestic silence.
 In this honest and curious narrative, the Bishop of <GPE>Cremona</GPE> represents the ceremonies of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court, which are still practised in the Sublime Porte, and which were preserved in the last age by the dukes of <GPE>Muscovy</GPE> or Russia.
 After a long journey by sea and land, from <GPE>Venice</GPE> to Constantinople, the ambassador halted at the golden gate, till he was conducted by the formal officers to the hospitable palace prepared for his reception; but this palace was a prison, and his jealous keepers prohibited all social intercourse either with strangers or natives.
 At his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> audience, he offered the gifts of his master, slaves, and golden vases, and costly armour.
 The ostentatious payment of the officers and troops displayed before his eyes the riches of the empire: he was entertained at a royal banquet, (51) in which the ambassadors of the nations were marshalled by the esteem or contempt of the Greeks: from his own table, the emperor, as the most signal favour, sent the plates which he had tasted; and his favourites were dismissed with a robe of honour.
 (52) In the morning and evening of each day, his civil and military servants attended their duty in the palace; their labours were repaid by the sight, perhaps by the smile, of their lord; his commands were signified by a nod or a sign: but all earthly greatness stood silent and submissive in his presence.
 Processions and acclamations.
 In his regular or extraordinary processions through the capital, he unveiled his person to the public view: the rites of policy were connected with those of religion, and his visits to the principal churches were regulated by the festivals of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> calendar.
 On the eve of these processions, the gracious or devout intention of the monarch was proclaimed by the heralds.
 The streets were cleared and purified; the pavement was strewed with flowers; the most precious furniture, the gold and silver plate, and silken hangings, were displayed from the windows and balconies, and a severe discipline restrained and silenced the tumult of the populace.
 The march was opened by the military officers at the head of their troops: they were followed in long order by the magistrates and ministers of the civil government: the person of the emperor was guarded by his eunuchs and domestics, and at the church door he was solemnly received by the patriarch and his clergy.
 The task of applause was not abandoned to the rude and spontaneous voices of the crowd.
 The most convenient stations were occupied by the bands of the blue and green factions of the circus; and their furious conflicts, which had shaken the capital, were insensibly sunk to an emulation of servitude.
 From either side they echoed in responsive melody the praises of the emperor; their poets and musicians directed the choir, and long life (53) and victory were the burden of every song.
 The same acclamations were performed at the audience, the banquet, and the church; and as an evidence of boundless sway, they were repeated in the Latin, (54) Gothic, Persian, French, and even <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> language, (55) by the mercenaries who sustained the real or fictitious character of those nations.
 By the pen of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> Porphyrogenitus, this science of form and flattery has been reduced into a pompous and trifling volume, (56) which the vanity of succeeding times might enrich with an ample supplement.
 Yet the calmer reflection of a prince would surely suggest that the same acclamations were applied to every character and every reign: and if he had risen from a private rank, he might remember, that his own voice had been the loudest and most eager in applause, at the very moment when he envied the fortune, or conspired against the life, of his predecessor.
 (57) Marriage of the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> with foreign nations.
 The princes of the North, of the nations, says Constantine, without faith or fame, were ambitious of mingling their blood with the blood of the Caesars, by their marriage with a royal virgin, or by the nuptials of their daughters with a <NORP>Roman</NORP> prince.
 (58) The aged monarch, in his instructions to his son, reveals the secret maxims of policy and pride; and suggests the most decent reasons for refusing these insolent and unreasonable demands.
 Every animal, says the discreet emperor, is prompted by the distinction of language, religion, and manners.
 A just regard to the purity of descent preserves the harmony of public and private life; but the mixture of foreign blood is the fruitful source of disorder and discord.
 Such had ever been the opinion and practice of the sage Romans: their jurisprudence proscribed the marriage of a citizen and a stranger: in the days of freedom and virtue, a senator would have scorned to match his daughter with a king: the glory of Mark Antony was sullied by an <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> wife: (59) and the emperor <PERSON>Titus</PERSON> was compelled, by popular censure, to dismiss with reluctance the reluctant Berenice.
 (60) This perpetual interdict was ratified by the fabulous sanction of the great Constantine.
 The ambassadors of the nations, more especially of the unbelieving nations, were solemnly admonished, that such strange alliances had been condemned by the founder of the church and city.
 Imaginary law of Constantine.
 The irrevocable law was inscribed on the altar of St.
 Sophia; and the impious prince who should stain the majesty of the purple was excluded from the civil and ecclesiastical communion of the Romans.
 If the ambassadors were instructed by any false brethren in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> history, they might produce <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> memorable examples of the violation of this imaginary law: the marriage of Leo, or rather of his father <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the Fourth, with the daughter of the king of the Chozars, the nuptials of the granddaughter of <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> with a <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> prince, and the union of <PERSON>Bertha</PERSON> of <GPE>France</GPE> or <GPE>Italy</GPE> with young Romanus, the son of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> <PERSON>Porphyrogenitus</PERSON> himself.
 To these objections <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> answers were prepared, which solved the difficulty and established the law.
 The first.
 Exception, A.
D.
 733.
 1.
 The deed and the guilt of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> Copronymus were acknowledged.
 The <NORP>Isaurian</NORP> heretic, who sullied the baptismal font, and declared war against the holy images, had indeed embraced a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> wife.
 By this impious alliance he accomplished the measure of his crimes, and was devoted to the just censure of the church and of posterity.
 The second, A.
D.
 941.
 <CARDINAL>2.
</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> could not be alleged as a legitimate emperor; he was a plebeian usurper, ignorant of the laws, and regardless of the honour, of the monarchy.
 His son Christopher, the father of the bride, was the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> in rank in the college of princes, at once the subject and the accomplice of a rebellious parent.
 The <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> were sincere and devout Christians; and the safety of the empire, with the redemption of many thousand captives, depended on this preposterous alliance.
 Yet no consideration could dispense from the law of Constantine: the clergy, the senate, and the people, disapproved the conduct of Romanus; and he was reproached, both in his life and death, as the author of the public disgrace.
 The third, A.
D.
 943.
 3.
 For the marriage of his own son with the daughter of Hugo, king of Italy, a more honourable defence is contrived by the wise Porphyrogenitus.
 Constantine, the great and holy, esteemed the fidelity and valour of the Franks; (61) and his prophetic spirit beheld the vision of their future greatness.
They alone were excepted from the general prohibition: Hugo, king of France, was the lineal descendant of Charlemagne; (62) and his daughter <PERSON>Bertha</PERSON> inherited the prerogatives of her family and nation.
 The voice of truth and malice insensibly betrayed the fraud or error of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court.
 The patrimonial estate of <EVENT>Hugo</EVENT> was reduced from the monarchy of <GPE>France</GPE> to the simple county of Arles; though it was not denied, that, in the confusion of the times, he had usurped the sovereignty of Provence, and invaded the kingdom of Italy.
 His father was a private noble; and if <PERSON>Bertha</PERSON> derived her female descent from the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> line, every step was polluted with illegitimacy or vice.
 The grandmother of <EVENT>Hugo</EVENT> was the famous Valdrada, the concubine, rather than the wife, of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Lothair; whose adultery, divorce, and <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> nuptials, had provoked against him the thunders of the Vatican.
 His mother, as she was styled, the great Bertha, was successively the wife of the count of <PERSON>Arles</PERSON> and of the marquis of Tuscany: <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> were scandalized by her gallantries; and, till the age of threescore, her lovers, of every degree, were the zealous servants of her ambition.
 The example of maternal incontinence was copied by the king of Italy; and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> favourite concubines of <EVENT>Hugo</EVENT> were decorated with the classic names of Venus, Juno, and Semele.
 (63) The daughter of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> was granted to the solicitations of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court: her name of <PERSON>Bertha</PERSON> was changed to that of Eudoxia; and she was wedded, or rather betrothed, to young Romanus, the future heir of the empire of the East.
 The consummation of this foreign alliance was suspended by the tender age of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> parties; and, at the end of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, the union was dissolved by the death of the virgin spouse.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife of the emperor <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> was a maiden of plebeian, but of Roman, birth; and their <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> daughters, <PERSON>Theophano</PERSON> and Anne, were given in marriage to the princes of the earth.
 <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> of Germany, A.
D.
 972.
 The eldest was bestowed, as the pledge of peace, on the eldest son of the great Otho, who had solicited this alliance with arms and embassies.
 It might legally be questioned how far a <PERSON>Saxon</PERSON> was entitled to the privilege of the <NORP>French</NORP> nation; but every scruple was silenced by the fame and piety of a hero who had restored the empire of the West.
 After the death of her father-in-law and husband, <PERSON>Theophano</PERSON> governed Rome, Italy, and Germany, during the minority of her son, the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> Otho; and the <NORP>Latins</NORP> have praised the virtues of an empress, who sacrificed to a superior duty the remembrance of her country.
 (64) In the nuptials of her sister Anne, every prejudice was lost, and every consideration of dignity was superseded, by the stronger argument of necessity and fear.
 <PERSON>Wolodomir</PERSON> of Russia, A.
D.
 988.
 A <NORP>Pagan</NORP> of the North, Wolodomir, great prince of Russia, aspired to a daughter of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> purple; and his claim was enforced by the threats of war, the promise of conversion, and the offer of a powerful succour against a domestic rebel.
 A victim of her religion and country, the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> princess was torn from the palace of her fathers, and condemned to a savage reign, and a hopeless exile on the banks of the Borysthenes, or in the neighbourhood of the <LOC>Polar</LOC> circle.
 (65) Yet the marriage of <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> was fortunate and fruitful: the daughter of her grandson <PERSON>Joroslaus</PERSON> was recommended by her <ORG>Imperial</ORG> descent; and the king of France, Henry I.
, sought a wife on the last borders of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Christendom.
 (66) Despotic power.
 In the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace, the emperor was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> slave of the ceremonies which he imposed, of the rigid forms which regulated each word and gesture, besieged him in the palace, and violated the leisure of his rural solitude.
 But the lives and fortunes of <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> hung on his arbitrary will; and the firmest minds, superior to the allurements of pomp and luxury, may be seduced by the more active pleasure of commanding their equals.
 The legislative and executive powers were centred in the person of the monarch, and the last remains of the authority of the senate were finally eradicated by <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the philosopher.
 (67) A lethargy of servitude had benumbed the minds of the Greeks: in the wildest tumults of rebellion they never aspired to the idea of a free constitution; and the private character of the prince was the only source and measure of their public happiness.
 Superstition rivetted their chains; in the church of St.
 Sophia he was solemnly crowned by the patriarch; at the foot of the altar, Coronation oath.
 they pledged their passive and unconditional obedience to his government and family.
 On his side he engaged to abstain as much as possible from the capital punishments of death and mutilation; his orthodox creed was subscribed with his own hand, and he promised to obey the decrees of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> synods, and the canons of the holy church.
 (68) But the assurance of mercy was loose and indefinite: he swore, not to his people, but to an invisible judge; and except in the inexpiable guilt of heresy, the ministers of heaven were always prepared to preach the indefeasible right, and to absolve the venial transgressions, of their sovereign.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> ecclesiastics were themselves the subjects of the civil magistrate: at the nod of a tyrant, the bishops were created, or transferred, or deposed, or punished with an ignominious death: whatever might be their wealth or influence, they could never succeed like the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> clergy in the establishment of an independent republic; and the patriarch of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> condemned, what he secretly envied, the temporal greatness of his <NORP>Roman</NORP> brother.
 Yet the exercise of boundless despotism is happily checked by the laws of nature and necessity.
 In proportion to his wisdom and virtue, the master of an empire is confined to the path of his sacred and laborious duty.
 In proportion to his vice and folly, he drops the sceptre too weighty for his hands; and the motions of the royal image are ruled by the imperceptible thread of some minister or favourite, who undertakes for his private interest to exercise the task of the public oppression.
 In some fatal moment, the most absolute monarch may dread the reason or the caprice of a nation of slaves; and experience has proved, that whatever is gained in the extent, is lost in the safety and solidity, of regal power.
 Military force of the Greeks, the Saracens, and the Franks.
 Whatever titles a despot may assume, whatever claims he may assert, it is on the sword that he must ultimately depend to guard him against his foreign and domestic enemies.
 From the age of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> to that of the Crusades, the world (for I overlook the remote monarchy of China) was occupied and disputed by the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> great empires or nations of the Greeks, the Saracens, and the Franks.
 Their military strength may be ascertained by a comparison of their courage, their arts and riches, and their obedience to a supreme head, who might call into action all the energies of the state.
 The Greeks, far inferior to their rivals in the first, were superior to the Franks, and at least equal to the Saracens, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of these warlike qualifications.
 <ORG>Navy</ORG> of the Greeks.
 The wealth of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> enabled them to purchase the service of the poorer nations, and to maintain a naval power for the protection of their coasts and the annoyance of their enemies.
 (69) A commerce of mutual benefit exchanged the gold of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> for the blood of <NORP>Sclavonians</NORP> and Turks, the <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> and Russians: their valour contributed to the victories of <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> and Zimisces; and if a hostile people pressed too closely on the frontier, they were recalled to the defence of their country, and the desire of peace, by the well-managed attack of a more distant tribe.
 (70) The command of the Mediterranean, from the mouth of the <LOC>Tanais</LOC> to the columns of Hercules, was always claimed, and often possessed, by the successors of Constantine.
 Their capital was filled with naval stores and dexterous artificers: the situation of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Asia, the long coasts, deep gulfs, and numerous islands, accustomed their subjects to the exercise of navigation; and the trade of <GPE>Venice</GPE> and <GPE>Amalfi</GPE> supplied a nursery of seamen to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> fleet.
 (71) Since the time of the Peloponnesian and Punic wars, the sphere of action had not been enlarged; and the science of naval architecture appears to have declined.
 The art of constructing those stupendous machines which displayed three, or six, or ten, ranges of oars, rising above, or falling behind, each other, was unknown to the ship-builders of Constantinople, as well as to the mechanicians of modern days.
 (72) The Dromones, (73) or light galleys of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire, were content with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tier of oars; each tier was composed of five-and-twenty benches; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rowers were seated on each bench, who plied their oars on either side of the vessel.
 To these we must add the captain or centurion, who, in time of action, stood erect with his armour-bearer on the poop, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> steersmen at the helm, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> officers at the prow, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> to manage the anchor, the other to point and play against the enemy the tube of liquid fire.
 The whole crew, as in the infancy of the art, performed the double service of mariners and soldiers; they were provided with defensive and offensive arms, with bows and arrows, which they used from the upper deck, with long pikes, which they pushed through the portholes of the lower tier.
 Sometimes, indeed, the ships of war were of a larger and more solid construction; and the labours of combat and navigation were more regularly divided between <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> soldiers and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and thirty mariners.
 But for the most part they were of the light and manageable size; and as the Cape of Malea in <GPE>Peloponesus</GPE> was still clothed with its ancient terrors, an <ORG>Imperial</ORG> fleet was transported <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> miles over land across the <LOC>Isthmus</LOC> of Corinth.
 (74) The principles of maritime tactics had not undergone any change since the time of Thucydides: a squadron of galleys still advanced in a crescent, charged to the front, and strove to impel their sharp beaks against the feeble sides of their antagonists.
 A machine for casting stones and darts was built of strong timbers, in the midst of the deck; and the operation of boarding was effected by a crane that hoisted baskets of armed men.
 The language of signals, so clear and copious in the naval grammar of the moderns, was imperfectly expressed by the various positions and colours of a commanding flag.
 In the darkness of the night, the same orders to chase, to attack, to halt, to retreat, to break, to form, were conveyed by the lights of the leading galley.
 By land, the fire-signals were repeated from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mountain to another; a chain of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> stations commanded a space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred miles; and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> in a few hours was apprised of the hostile motions of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Tarsus.
 (75) Some estimate may be formed of the power of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors, by the curious and <TIME>minute</TIME> detail of the armament which was prepared for the reduction of Crete.
 A fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> galleys, and <CARDINAL>seventy-five</CARDINAL> vessels of the <NORP>Pamphylian</NORP> style, was equipped in the capital, the islands of the <LOC>Aegean</LOC> Sea, and the seaports of Asia, Macedonia, and Greece.
 It carried <CARDINAL>thirty-four</CARDINAL> thousand mariners, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> soldiers, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred Russians, and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> thousand and eighty-seven Mardaites, whose fathers had been transplanted from the mountains of Libanus.
 Their pay, most probably of a month, was computed at <CARDINAL>thirty-four</CARDINAL> centenaries of gold, about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and thirty-six thousand pounds sterling.
 Our fancy is bewildered by the endless recapitulation of arms and engines, of clothes and linen, of bread for the men and forage for the horses, and of stores and utensils of every description, inadequate to the conquest of a petty island, but amply sufficient for the establishment of a flourishing colony.
 (76) Tactics and character of the Greeks.
 The invention of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire did not, like that of gun powder, produce a total revolution in the art of war.
 To these liquid combustibles the city and empire of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> owed their deliverance; and they were employed in sieges and sea-fights with terrible effect.
 But they were either less improved, or less susceptible of improvement: the engines of antiquity, the catapultae, balistae, and battering-rams, were still of most frequent and powerful use in the attack and defence of fortifications; nor was the decision of battles reduced to the quick and heavy fire of a line of infantry, whom it were fruitless to protect with armour against a similar fire of their enemies.
 Steel and iron were still the common instruments of destruction and safety; and the helmets, cuirasses, and shields, of the tenth century did not, either in form or substance, essentially differ from those which had covered the companions of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or Achilles.
 (77) But instead of accustoming the modern Greeks, like the legionaries of old, to the constant and easy use of this salutary weight, their armour was laid aside in light chariots, which followed the march, till, on the approach of an enemy, they resumed with haste and reluctance the unusual encumbrance.
 Their offensive weapons consisted of swords, battle-axes, and spears; but the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> pike was shortened a <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> of its length, and reduced to the more convenient measure of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> cubits or feet.
 The sharpness of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> and <NORP>Arabian</NORP> arrows had been severely felt; and the emperors lament the decay of archery as a cause of the public misfortunes, and recommend, as an advice and a command, that the military youth, till the age of forty, should assiduously practise the exercise of the bow.
 (78) The bands, or regiments, were usually <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred strong; and, as a medium between the extremes of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> and sixteen, the foot soldiers of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were formed <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> deep; but the cavalry charged in <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> ranks, from the reasonable consideration, that the weight of the front could not be increased by any pressure of the hindmost horses.
 If the ranks of the infantry or cavalry were sometimes doubled, this cautious array betrayed a secret distrust of the courage of the troops, whose numbers might swell the appearance of the line, but of whom only a chosen band would dare to encounter the spears and swords of the Barbarians.
 The order of battle must have varied according to the ground, the object, and the adversary; but their ordinary disposition, in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> lines and a reserve, presented a succession of hopes and resources most agreeable to the temper as well as the judgment of the Greeks.
 (79) In case of a repulse, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> line fell back into the intervals of the second; and the reserve, breaking into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> divisions, wheeled round the flanks to improve the victory or cover the retreat.
 Whatever authority could enact was accomplished, at least in theory, by the camps and marches, the exercises and evolutions, the edicts and books, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> monarch.
 (80) Whatever art could produce from the forge, the loom, or the laboratory, was abundantly supplied by the riches of the prince, and the industry of his numerous workmen.
 But neither authority nor art could frame the most important machine, the soldier himself; and if the ceremonies of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> always suppose the safe and triumphal return of the emperor, (81) his tactics seldom soar above the means of escaping a defeat, and procrastinating the war.
 (82) Notwithstanding some transient success, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were sunk in their own esteem and that of their neighbours.
 A cold hand and a loquacious tongue was the vulgar description of the nation: the author of the tactics was besieged in his capital; and the last of the Barbarians, who trembled at the name of the Saracens, or Franks, could proudly exhibit the medals of gold and silver which they had extorted from the feeble sovereign of Constantinople.
 What spirit their government and character denied, might have been inspired in some degree by the influence of religion; but the religion of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> could only teach them to suffer and to yield.
 The emperor Nicephorus, who restored for a moment the discipline and glory of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name, was desirous of bestowing the honours of martyrdom on the <NORP>Christians</NORP> who lost their lives in a holy war against the infidels.
 But this political law was defeated by the opposition of the patriarch, the bishops, and the principal senators; and they strenuously urged the canons of St.
 Basil, that all who were polluted by the bloody trade of a soldier should be separated, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, from the communion of the faithful.
 (83) Character and tactics of the Saracens.
 These scruples of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> have been compared with the tears of the primitive <NORP>Moslems</NORP> when they were held back from battle; and this contrast of base superstition and high-spirited enthusiasm, unfolds to a philosophic eye the history of the rival nations.
 The subjects of the last caliphs (84) had undoubtedly degenerated from the zeal and faith of the companions of the prophet.
 Yet their martial creed still represented the Deity as the author of war: (85) the vital though latent spark of fanaticism still glowed in the heart of their religion, and among the Saracens, who dwelt on the <NORP>Christian</NORP> borders, it was frequently rekindled to a lively and active flame.
 Their regular force was formed of the valiant slaves who had been educated to guard the person and accompany the standard of their lord: but the <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> people of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Cilicia, of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Spain, was awakened by the trumpet which proclaimed a holy war against the infidels.
 The rich were ambitious of death or victory in the cause of God; the poor were allured by the hopes of plunder; and the old, the infirm, and the women, assumed their share of meritorious service by sending their substitutes, with arms and horses, into the field.
 These offensive and defensive arms were similar in strength and temper to those of the Romans, whom they far excelled in the management of the horse and the bow: the massy silver of their belts, their bridles, and their swords, displayed the magnificence of a prosperous nation; and except some black archers of the South, the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> disdained the naked bravery of their ancestors.
 Instead of wagons, they were attended by a long train of camels, mules, and asses: the multitude of these animals, whom they bedecked with flags and streamers, appeared to swell the pomp and magnitude of their host; and the horses of the enemy were often disordered by the uncouth figure and odious smell of the camels of the East.
 Invincible by their patience of thirst and heat, their spirits were frozen by a winter's cold, and the consciousness of their propensity to sleep exacted the most rigorous precautions against the surprises of the night.
 Their order of battle was a long square of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> deep and solid lines; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of archers, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> of cavalry.
 In their engagements by sea and land, they sustained with patient firmness the fury of the attack, and seldom advanced to the charge till they could discern and oppress the lassitude of their foes.
 But if they were repulsed and broken, they knew not how to rally or renew the combat; and their dismay was heightened by the superstitious prejudice, that God had declared himself on the side of their enemies.
 The decline and fall of the caliphs countenanced this fearful opinion; nor were there wanting, among the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> and Christians, some obscure prophecies (86) which prognosticated their alternate defeats.
 The unity of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> empire was dissolved, but the independent fragments were equal to populous and powerful kingdoms; and in their naval and military armaments, an emir of <GPE>Aleppo</GPE> or <GPE>Tunis</GPE> might command no despicable fund of skill, and industry, and treasure.
 In their transactions of peace and war with the Saracens, the princes of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> too often felt that these <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> had nothing barbarous in their discipline; and that if they were destitute of original genius, they had been endowed with a quick spirit of curiosity and imitation.
 The model was indeed more perfect than the copy; their ships, and engines, and fortifications, were of a less skilful construction; and they confess, without shame, that the same God who has given a tongue to the Arabians, had more nicely fashioned the hands of the Chinese, and the heads of the Greeks.
 (87) The <NORP>Franks</NORP> or Latins.
 A name of some <NORP>German</NORP> tribes between the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and the <LOC>Weser</LOC> had spread its victorious influence over the greatest part of Gaul, Germany, and Italy; and the common appellation of FRANKS (88) was applied by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Arabians</NORP> to the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> church, the nations of the West, who stretched beyond their knowledge to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.
 The vast body had been inspired and united by the soul of Charlemagne; but the division and degeneracy of his race soon annihilated the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> power, which would have rivalled the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> of Byzantium, and revenged the indignities of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> name.
 The enemies no longer feared, nor could the subjects any longer trust, the application of a public revenue, the labours of trade and manufactures in the military service, the mutual aid of provinces and armies, and the naval squadrons which were regularly stationed from the mouth of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> to that of the Tyber.
 In the beginning of the tenth century, the family of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> had almost disappeared; his monarchy was broken into many hostile and independent states; the regal title was assumed by the most ambitious chiefs; their revolt was imitated in a long subordination of anarchy and discord, and the nobles of every province disobeyed their sovereign, oppressed their vassals, and exercised perpetual hostilities against their equals and neighbours.
 Their private wars, which overturned the fabric of government, fomented the martial spirit of the nation.
 In the system of modern Europe, the power of the sword is possessed, at least in fact, by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> mighty potentates; their operations are conducted on a distant frontier, by an order of men who devote their lives to the study and practice of the military art: the rest of the country and community enjoys in the midst of war the tranquillity of peace, and is only made sensible of the change by the aggravation or decrease of the public taxes.
 In the disorders of the tenth and eleventh centuries, every peasant was a soldier, and every village a fortification; each wood or valley was a scene of murder and rapine; and the lords of each castle were compelled to assume the character of princes and warriors.
 To their own courage and policy they boldly trusted for the safety of their family, the protection of their lands, and the revenge of their injuries; and, like the conquerors of a larger size, they were too apt to transgress the privilege of defensive war.
 The powers of the mind and body were hardened by the presence of danger and necessity of resolution: the same spirit refused to desert a friend and to forgive an enemy; and, instead of sleeping under the guardian care of a magistrate, they proudly disdained the authority of the laws.
 In the days of feudal anarchy, the instruments of agriculture and art were converted into the weapons of bloodshed: the peaceful occupations of civil and ecclesiastical society were abolished or corrupted; and the bishop who exchanged his mitre for a helmet, was more forcibly urged by the manners of the times than by the obligation of his tenure.
 (89) Their character and tactics.
 The love of freedom and of arms was felt, with conscious pride, by the <NORP>Franks</NORP> themselves, and is observed by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> with some degree of amazement and terror.
 A nation endowed with such high and intrepid spirit, must have been secure of victory if these advantages had not been counter-balanced by many weighty defects.
 The decay of their naval power left the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Saracens</NORP> in possession of the sea, for every purpose of annoyance and supply.
 In the age which preceded the institution of knighthood, the <NORP>Franks</NORP> were rude and unskilful in the service of cavalry; (91) and in all perilous emergencies, their warriors were so conscious of their ignorance, that they chose to dismount from their horses and fight on foot.
 Unpractised in the use of pikes, or of missile weapons, they were encumbered by the length of their swords, the weight of their armour, the magnitude of their shields, and, if I may repeat the satire of the meagre Greeks, by their unwieldy intemperance.
 Their independent spirit disdained the yoke of subordination, and abandoned the standard of their chief, if he attempted to keep the field beyond the term of their stipulation or service.
 On all sides they were open to the snares of an enemy less brave but more artful than themselves.
 They might be bribed, for the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were venal; or surprised in the night, for they neglected the precautions of a close encampment or vigilant sentinels.
 The fatigues of a summer's campaign exhausted their strength and patience, and they sunk in despair if their voracious appetite was disappointed of a plentiful supply of wine and of food.
 This general character of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> was marked with some national and local shades, which I should ascribe to accident rather than to climate, but which were visible both to natives and to foreigners.
 An ambassador of the great <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> declared, in the palace of Constantinople, that the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> could dispute with swords better than with pens, and that they preferred inevitable death to the dishonour of turning their backs to an enemy.
 (92) It was the glory of the nobles of France, that, in their humble dwellings, war and rapine were the only pleasure, the sole occupation, of their lives.
 They affected to deride the palaces, the banquets, the polished manner of the Italians, who in the estimate of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> themselves had degenerated from the liberty and valour of the ancient Lombards.
 (93) Oblivion of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> language.
 By the well-known edict of Caracalla, his subjects, from <GPE>Britain</GPE> to Egypt, were entitled to the name and privileges of Romans, and their national sovereign might fix his occasional or permanent residence in any province of their common country.
 In the division of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, an ideal unity was scrupulously observed, and in their titles, laws, and statutes, the successors of <ORG>Arcadius</ORG> and <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> announced themselves as the inseparable colleagues of the same office, as the joint sovereigns of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world and city, which were bounded by the same limits.
 After the fall of the <NORP>Western</NORP> monarchy, the majesty of the purple resided solely in the princes of Constantinople; and of these, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who, after a divorce of <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> years, regained the dominion of ancient Rome, and asserted, by the right of conquest, the august title of Emperor of the Romans.
 (94) A motive of vanity or discontent solicited <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his successors, <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> the Second, to abandon the Thracian Bosphorus, and to restore the pristine honours of the Tyber: an extravagant project, (exclaims the malicious Byzantine,) as if he had despoiled a beautiful and blooming virgin, to enrich, or rather to expose, the deformity of a wrinkled and decrepit matron.
 (95) But the sword of the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> opposed his settlement in Italy: he entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> not as a conqueror, but as a fugitive, and, after a visit of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> days, he pillaged, and forever deserted, the ancient capital of the world.
 (96) The final revolt and separation of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was accomplished about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> centuries after the conquests of Justinian, and from his reign we may date the gradual oblivion of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> tongue.
 That legislator had composed his Institutes, his Code, and his Pandects, in a language which he celebrates as the proper and public style of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government, the consecrated idiom of the palace and senate of Constantinople, of the campus and tribunals of the East.
 (97) But this foreign dialect was unknown to the people and soldiers of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> provinces, it was imperfectly understood by the greater part of the interpreters of the laws and the ministers of the state.
 After a short conflict, nature and habit prevailed over the obsolete institutions of human power: for the general benefit of his subjects, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> promulgated his novels in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> languages: the several parts of his voluminous jurisprudence were successively translated; (98) the original was forgotten, the version was studied, and the Greek, whose intrinsic merit deserved indeed the preference, obtained a legal, as well as popular establishment in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> monarchy.
 The birth and residence of succeeding princes estranged them from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> idiom: <PERSON>Tiberius</PERSON> by the Arabs, (99) and <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> by the Italians, (100) are distinguished as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> Caesars, as the founders of a new dynasty and empire: the silent revolution was accomplished before the death of Heraclius; and the ruins of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> speech were darkly preserved in the terms of jurisprudence and the acclamations of the palace.
 After the restoration of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire by <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> and the Othos, the names of <NORP>Franks</NORP> and <NORP>Latins</NORP> acquired an equal signification and extent; and these haughty <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> asserted, with some justice, their superior claim to the language and dominion of Rome.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors and their subjects retain and assert the name of Romans.
 They insulted the alien of the <LOC>East</LOC> who had renounced the dress and idiom of Romans; and their reasonable practice will justify the frequent appellation of Greeks.
 (101) But this contemptuous appellation was indignantly rejected by the prince and people to whom it was applied.
 Whatsoever changes had been introduced by the lapse of ages, they alleged a lineal and unbroken succession from <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Constantine; and, in the lowest period of degeneracy and decay, the name of ROMANS adhered to the last fragments of the empire of Constantinople.
 (102) Period of ignorance.
 While the government of the <LOC>East</LOC> was transacted in Latin, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> was the language of literature and philosophy; nor could the masters of this rich and perfect idiom be tempted to envy the borrowed learning and imitative taste of their <NORP>Roman</NORP> disciples.
 After the fall of Paganism, the loss of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Egypt, and the extinction of the schools of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> and Athens, the studies of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> insensibly retired to some regular monasteries, and above all, to the royal college of Constantinople, which was burnt in the reign of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Isaurian.
 (103) In the pompous style of the age, the president of that foundation was named the Sun of Science: his <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> associates, the professors in the different arts and faculties, were the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> signs of the zodiac; a library of thirty-six thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred volumes was open to their inquiries; and they could show an ancient manuscript of Homer, on a roll of parchment <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> feet in length, the intestines, as it was fabled, of a prodigious serpent.
 (104) But the seventh and <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> centuries were a period of discord and darkness: the library was burnt, the college was abolished, the <NORP>Iconoclasts</NORP> are represented as the foes of antiquity; and a savage ignorance and contempt of letters has disgraced the princes of the <NORP>Heraclean</NORP> and <NORP>Isaurian</NORP> dynasties.
 (105) Revival of <NORP>Greek</NORP> learning.
 In the ninth century we trace the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> dawnings of the restoration of science.
 (106) After the fanaticism of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> had subsided, the caliphs aspired to conquer the arts, rather than the provinces, of the empire: their liberal curiosity rekindled the emulation of the Greeks, brushed away the dust from their ancient libraries, and taught them to know and reward the philosophers, whose labours had been hitherto repaid by the pleasure of study and the pursuit of truth.
 The <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> Bardas, the uncle of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the Third, was the generous protector of letters, a title which alone has preserved his memory and excused his ambition.
 A particle of the treasures of his nephew was sometimes diverted from the indulgence of vice and folly; a school was opened in the palace of Magnaura; and the presence of <PERSON>Bardas</PERSON> excited the emulation of the masters and students.
 At their head was the philosopher Leo, archbishop of Thessalonica: his profound skill in astronomy and the mathematics was admired by the strangers of the East; and this occult science was magnified by vulgar credulity, which modestly supposes that all knowledge superior to its own must be the effect of inspiration or magic.
 At the pressing entreaty of the Caesar, his friend, the celebrated Photius, (107) renounced the freedom of a secular and studious life, ascended the patriarchal throne, and was alternately excommunicated and absolved by the synods of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West.
 By the confession even of priestly hatred, no art or science, except poetry, was foreign to this universal scholar, who was deep in thought, indefatigable in reading, and eloquent in diction.
 Whilst he exercised the office of protospathaire or captain of the guards, <PERSON>Photius</PERSON> was sent ambassador to the caliph of Bagdad.
 (108) The tedious hours of exile, perhaps of confinement, were beguiled by the hasty composition of his Library, a living monument of erudition and criticism.
 Two hundred and fourscore writers, historians, orators, philosophers, theologians, are reviewed without any regular method: he abridges their narrative or doctrine, appreciates their style and character, and judges even the fathers of the church with a discreet freedom, which often breaks through the superstition of the times.
 The emperor Basil, who lamented the defects of his own education, entrusted to the care of <PERSON>Photius</PERSON> his son and successor, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the philosopher; and the reign of that prince and of his son <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> <PERSON>Porphyrogenitus</PERSON> forms <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most prosperous aeras of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> literature.
 By their munificence the treasures of antiquity were deposited in the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> library; by their pens, or those of their associates, they were imparted in such extracts and abridgments as might amuse the curiosity, without oppressing the indolence, of the public.
 Besides the Basilics, or code of laws, the arts of husbandry and war, of feeding or destroying the human species, were propagated with equal diligence; and the history of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and <GPE>Rome</GPE> was digested into <CARDINAL>fifty-three</CARDINAL> heads or titles, of which <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> only (of embassies, and of virtues and vices) have escaped the injuries of time.
 In every station, the reader might contemplate the image of the past world, apply the lesson or warning of each page, and learn to admire, perhaps to imitate, the examples of a brighter period.
 I shall not expatiate on the works of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> Greeks, who, by the assiduous study of the ancients, have deserved, in some measure, the remembrance and gratitude of the moderns.
 The scholars of the present age may still enjoy the benefit of the philosophical commonplace book of Stobaeus, the grammatical and historical lexicon of Suidas, the <NORP>Chiliads</NORP> of Tzetzes, which comprise <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred narratives in <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> thousand verses, and the commentaries on <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> of Eustathius, archbishop of Thessalonica, who, from his horn of plenty, has poured the names and authorities of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred writers.
 From these originals, and from the numerous tribe of scholiasts and critics, (109) some estimate may be formed of the literary wealth of the twelfth century: <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was enlightened by the genius of <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> and Demosthenes, of <PERSON>Aristotle</PERSON> and Plato: and in the enjoyment or neglect of our present riches, we must envy the generation that could still peruse the history of Theopompus, the orations of Hyperides, the comedies of Menander, (110) and the odes of <WORK_OF_ART>Alcaeus</WORK_OF_ART> and Sappho.
 The frequent labor of illustration attests not only the existence, but the popularity, of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> classics: the general knowledge of the age may be deduced from the example of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> learned females, the empress Eudocia, and the princess Anna Comnena, who cultivated, in the purple, the arts of rhetoric and philosophy.
 (111) The vulgar dialect of the city was gross and barbarous: a more correct and elaborate style distinguished the discourse, or at least the compositions, of the church and palace, which sometimes affected to copy the purity of the Attic models.
 Decay of taste and genius.
 In our modern education, the painful though necessary attainment of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> languages, which are no longer living, may consume the time and damp the ardour of the youthful student.
 The poets and orators were long imprisoned in the barbarous dialects of our <NORP>Western</NORP> ancestors, devoid of harmony or grace; and their genius, without precept or example, was abandoned to the rule and native powers of their judgment and fancy.
 But the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> of Constantinople, after purging away the impurities of their vulgar speech, acquired the free use of their ancient language, the most happy composition of human art, and a familiar knowledge of the sublime masters who had pleased or instructed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of nations.
 But these advantages only tend to aggravate the reproach and shame of a degenerate people.
 They held in their lifeless hands the riches of their fathers, without inheriting the spirit which had created and improved that sacred patrimony: they read, they praised, they compiled, but their languid souls seemed alike incapable of thought and action.
 In the revolution of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> centuries, not a single discovery was made to exalt the dignity or promote the happiness of mankind.
 Not a single idea has been added to the speculative systems of antiquity, and a succession of patient disciples became in their turn the dogmatic teachers of the next servile generation.
 Not a single composition of history, philosophy, or literature, has been saved from oblivion by the intrinsic beauties of style or sentiment, of original fancy, or even of successful imitation.
 In prose, the least offensive of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> writers are absolved from censure by their naked and unpresuming simplicity: but the orators, most eloquent (112) in their own conceit, are the farthest removed from the models whom they affect to emulate.
 In every page our taste and reason are wounded by the choice of gigantic and obsolete words, a stiff and intricate phraseology, the discord of images, the childish play of false or unseasonable ornament, and the painful attempt to elevate themselves, to astonish the reader, and to involve a trivial meaning in the smoke of obscurity and exaggeration.
 Their prose is soaring to the vicious affectation of poetry: their poetry is sinking below the flatness and insipidity of prose.
 The tragic, epic, and lyric muses, were silent and inglorious: the bards of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> seldom rose above a riddle or epigram, a panegyric or tale; they forgot even the rules of prosody; and with the melody of <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> yet sounding in their ears, they confound all measure of feet and syllables in the impotent strains which have received the name of political or city verses.
 (113) The minds of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> were bound in the fetters of a base and imperious superstition which extends her dominion round the circle of profane science.
 Their understandings were bewildered in metaphysical controversy: in the belief of visions and miracles, they had lost all principles of moral evidence, and their taste was vitiates by the homilies of the monks, an absurd medley of declamation and Scripture.
 Even these contemptible studies were no longer dignified by the abuse of superior talents: the leaders of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church were humbly content to admire and copy the oracles of antiquity, nor did the schools of pulpit produce any rivals of the fame of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> and Chrysostom.
 (114) Want of national emulation.
 In all the pursuits of active and speculative life, the emulation of states and individuals is the most powerful spring of the efforts and improvements of mankind.
 The cities of ancient <GPE>Greece</GPE> were cast in the happy mixture of union and independence, which is repeated on a larger scale, but in a looser form, by the nations of modern Europe; the union of language, religion, and manners, which renders them the spectators and judges of each other's merit; (115) the independence of government and interest, which asserts their separate freedom, and excites them to strive for preeminence in the career of glory.
 The situation of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was less favourable; yet in the early ages of the republic, which fixed the national character, a similar emulation was kindled among the states of <GPE>Latium</GPE> and Italy; and in the arts and sciences, they aspired to equal or surpass their <NORP>Grecian</NORP> masters.
 The empire of the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> undoubtedly checked the activity and progress of the human mind; its magnitude might indeed allow some scope for domestic competition; but when it was gradually reduced, at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to the <LOC>East</LOC> and at last to <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Constantinople, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> subjects were degraded to an abject and languid temper, the natural effect of their solitary and insulated state.
 From the <LOC>North</LOC> they were oppressed by nameless tribes of Barbarians, to whom they scarcely imparted the appellation of men.
 The language and religion of the more polished <NORP>Arabs</NORP> were an insurmountable bar to all social intercourse.
 The conquerors of <LOC>Europe</LOC> were their brethren in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith; but the speech of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> or <NORP>Latins</NORP> was unknown, their manners were rude, and they were rarely connected, in peace or war, with the successors of Heraclius.
 Alone in the universe, the self-satisfied pride of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was not disturbed by the comparison of foreign merit; and it is no wonder if they fainted in the race, since they had neither competitors to urge their speed, nor judges to crown their victory.
 The nations of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> were mingled by the expeditions to the Holy Land; and it is under the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasty that a faint emulation of knowledge and military virtue was rekindled in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
