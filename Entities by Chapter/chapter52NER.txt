The <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> Sieges of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by the Arabs—Their Invasion of France, and Defeat by <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> Martel— Civil War of the <NORP>Ommiades</NORP> and Abbassides—Learning of the Arabs—Luxury of the Caliphs—Naval Enterprises on Crete, Sicily, and Rome—Decay and Division of the Empire of the Caliphs—Defeats and Victories of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> Emperors.
Limits of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquests When the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> issued from the desert, they must have been surprised at the ease and rapidity of their own success.
 But when they advanced in the career of victory to the banks of the <LOC>Indus</LOC> and the summit of the Pyrenees; when they had repeatedly tried the edge of their scymetars and the energy of their faith, they might be equally astonished that any nation could resist their invincible arms; that any boundary should confine the dominion of the successor of the prophet.
 The confidence of soldiers and fanatics may indeed be excused, since the calm historian of the present hour, who strives to follow the rapid course of the Saracens, must study to explain by what means the church and state were saved from this impending, and, as it should seem, from this inevitable, danger.
 The deserts of <LOC>Scythia</LOC> and <LOC>Sarmatia</LOC> might be guarded by their extent, their climate, their poverty, and the courage of the northern shepherds; <GPE>China</GPE> was remote and inaccessible; but the greatest part of the temperate zone was subject to the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> conquerors, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were exhausted by the calamities of war and the loss of their fairest provinces, and the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of <LOC>Europe</LOC> might justly tremble at the precipitate fall of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> monarchy.
 In this inquiry I shall unfold the events that rescued our ancestors of Britain, and our neighbours of Gaul, from the civil and religious yoke of the Koran; that protected the majesty of Rome, and delayed the servitude of Constantinople; that invigorated the defence of the Christians, and scattered among their enemies the seeds of division and decay.
 <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by the Arabs, A.
D.
 668-675 Forty-six <DATE>years</DATE> after the flight of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> from Mecca, his disciples appeared in arms under the walls of Constantinople.
 (1) They were animated by a genuine or fictitious saying of the prophet, that, to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> army which besieged the city of the Caesars, their sins were forgiven: the long series of <NORP>Roman</NORP> triumphs would be meritoriously transferred to the conquerors of New Rome; and the wealth of nations was deposited in this well-chosen seat of royalty and commerce.
 No sooner had the caliph <PERSON>Moawiyah</PERSON> suppressed his rivals and established his throne, than he aspired to expiate the guilt of civil blood, by the success and glory of this holy expedition; (2) his preparations by sea and land were adequate to the importance of the object; his standard was entrusted to Sophian, a veteran warrior, but the troops were encouraged by the example and presence of Yezid, the son and presumptive heir of the commander of the faithful.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> had little to hope, nor had their enemies any reason of fear, from the courage and vigilance of the reigning emperor, who disgraced the name of Constantine, and imitated only the inglorious <DATE>years</DATE> of his grandfather Heraclius.
 Without delay or opposition, the naval forces of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> passed through the unguarded channel of the Hellespont, which even now, under the feeble and disorderly government of the Turks, is maintained as the natural bulwark of the capital.
 (3) The <NORP>Arabian</NORP> fleet cast anchor, and the troops were disembarked near the palace of Hebdomon, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> miles from the city.
 During many days, from the dawn of light to the evening, the line of assault was extended from the golden gate to the eastern promontory and the foremost warriors were impelled by the weight and effort of the succeeding columns.
 But the besiegers had formed an insufficient estimate of the strength and resources of Constantinople.
 The solid and lofty walls were guarded by numbers and discipline: the spirit of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was rekindled by the last danger of their religion and empire: the fugitives from the conquered provinces more successfully renewed the defence of <GPE>Damascus</GPE> and Alexandria; and the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were dismayed by the strange and prodigious effects of artificial fire.
 This firm and effectual resistance diverted their arms to the more easy attempt of plundering the <NORP>European</NORP> and <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> coasts of the Propontis; and, after keeping the sea from the <DATE>month</DATE> of April to that of September, on the approach of <DATE>winter</DATE> they retreated fourscore miles from the capital, to the Isle of Cyzicus, in which they had established their magazine of spoil and provisions.
 So patient was their perseverance, or so languid were their operations, that they repeated in the six following summers the same attack and retreat, with a gradual abatement of hope and vigour, till the mischances of shipwreck and disease, of the sword and of fire, compelled them to relinquish the fruitless enterprise.
 They might bewail the loss, or commemorate the martyrdom, of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand Moslems, who fell in the siege of Constantinople; and the solemn funeral of Abu Ayub, or Job, excited the curiosity of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> themselves.
 That venerable Arab, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the last of the companions of Mahomet, was numbered among the ansars, or auxiliaries, of Medina, who sheltered the head of the flying prophet.
 In his youth he fought, at <PERSON>Beder</PERSON> and Ohud, under the holy standard: in his mature age he was the friend and follower of Ali; and the last remnant of his strength and life was consumed in a distant and dangerous war against the enemies of the Koran.
 His memory was revered; but the place of his burial was neglected and unknown, during a period of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty years, till the conquest of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> the Second.
 A seasonable vision (for such are the manufacture of every religion) revealed the holy spot at the foot of the walls and the bottom of the harbour; and the mosch of <GPE>Ayub</GPE> has been deservedly chosen for the simple and martial inauguration of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultans.
 (4) <FAC>Peace</FAC> and tribute, A.
D.
 677.
 The event of the siege revived, both in the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, the reputation of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms, and cast a momentary shade over the glories of the Saracens.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> ambassador was favourably received at Damascus, a general council of the emirs or Koreish: a peace, or truce, of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was ratified between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires; and the stipulation of an annual tribute, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> horses of a noble breed, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> slaves, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand pieces of gold, degraded the majesty of the commander of the faithful.
 (5) The aged caliph was desirous of possessing his dominions, and ending his days in tranquillity and repose: while the <NORP>Moors</NORP> and <NORP>Indians</NORP> trembled at his name, his palace and city of <GPE>Damascus</GPE> was insulted by the Mardaites, or Maronites, of Mount Libanus, the firmest barrier of the empire, till they were disarmed and transplanted by the suspicious policy of the Greeks.
 (6) After the revolt of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> and Persia, the house of Ommiyah.
 (7) was reduced to the kingdoms of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Egypt: their distress and fear enforced their compliance with the pressing demands of the Christians; and the tribute was increased to a slave, a horse, and a thousand pieces of gold, for each of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five days of the solar year.
 But as soon as the empire was again united by the arms and policy of Abdalmalek, he disclaimed a badge of servitude not less injurious to his conscience than to his pride; he discontinued the payment of the tribute; and the resentment of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was disabled from action by the mad tyranny of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Justinian, the just rebellion of his subjects, and the frequent change of his antagonists and successors.
 Till the reign of Abdalmalek, the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> had been content with the free possession of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> and <NORP>Roman</NORP> treasures, in the coins of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> and Caesar.
 By the command of that caliph, a national mint was established, both for silver and gold, and the inscription of the Dinar, though it might be censured by some timorous casuists, proclaimed the unity of the God of Mahomet.
 (8) Under the reign of the caliph Walid, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language and characters were excluded from the accounts of the public revenue.
 (9) If this change was productive of the invention or familiar use of our present numerals, the <LANGUAGE>Arabic</LANGUAGE> or <NORP>Indian</NORP> ciphers, as they are commonly styled, a regulation of office has promoted the most important discoveries of arithmetic, algebra, and the mathematical sciences.
 (10) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of Constantinople, A.
D.
 716-718.
 Whilst the caliph <PERSON>Walid</PERSON> sat idle on the throne of Damascus, whilst his lieutenants achieved the conquest of <NORP>Transoxiana</NORP> and Spain, a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> army of <NORP>Saracens</NORP> overspread the provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, and approached the borders of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> capital.
 But the attempt and disgrace of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> siege was reserved for his brother Soliman, whose ambition appears to have been quickened by a more active and martial spirit.
 In the revolutions of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire, after the tyrant <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> had been punished and avenged, an humble secretary, <PRODUCT>Anastasius</PRODUCT> or Artemius, was promoted by chance or merit to the vacant purple.
 He was alarmed by the sound of war; and his ambassador returned from <GPE>Damascus</GPE> with the tremendous news, that the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were preparing an armament by sea and land, such as would transcend the experience of the past, or the belief of the present age.
 The precautions of <PRODUCT>Anastasius</PRODUCT> were not unworthy of his station, or of the impending danger.
 He issued a peremptory mandate, that all persons who were not provided with the means of subsistence for a <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years' siege should evacuate the city: the public granaries and arsenals were abundantly replenished; the walls were restored and strengthened; and the engines for casting stones, or darts, or fire, were stationed along the ramparts, or in the brigantines of war, of which an additional number was hastily constructed.
 To prevent is safer, as well as more honourable, than to repel, an attack; and a design was meditated, above the usual spirit of the Greeks, of burning the naval stores of the enemy, the cypress timber that had been hewn in Mount Libanus, and was piled along the sea-shore of Phoenicia, for the service of the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> fleet.
 This generous enterprise was defeated by the cowardice or treachery of the troops, who, in the new language of the empire, were styled of the Obsequian Theme.
 (11) They murdered their chief, deserted their standard in the Isle of Rhodes, dispersed themselves over the adjacent continent, and deserved pardon or reward by investing with the purple a simple officer of the revenue.
 The name of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> might recommend him to the senate and people; but, after some months, he sunk into a cloister, and resigned, to the firmer hand of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Isaurian, the urgent defence of the capital and empire.
 The most formidable of the Saracens, Moslemah, the brother of the caliph, was advancing at the head of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Arabs</NORP> and Persians, the greater part mounted on horses or camels; and the successful sieges of Tyana, Amorium, and Pergamus, were of sufficient duration to exercise their skill and to elevate their hopes.
 At the well-known passage of Abydus, on the Hellespont, the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> arms were transported, for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time, from <LOC>Asia</LOC> to Europe.
 From thence, wheeling round the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> cities of the Propontis, <PERSON>Moslemah</PERSON> invested <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> on the land side, surrounded his camp with a ditch and rampart, prepared and planted his engines of assault, and declared, by words and actions, a patient resolution of expecting the return of seed-time and harvest, should the obstinacy of the besieged prove equal to his own.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> would gladly have ransomed their religion and empire, by a fine or assessment of a piece of gold on the head of each inhabitant of the city; but the liberal offer was rejected with disdain, and the presumption of <PERSON>Moslemah</PERSON> was exalted by the speedy approach and invincible force of the natives of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Syria.
 They are said to have amounted to <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> ships: the number betrays their inconsiderable size; and of the <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> stout and capacious vessels, whose magnitude impeded their progress, each was manned with no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> heavy-armed soldiers.
 This huge armada proceeded on a smooth sea, and with a gentle gale, towards the mouth of the Bosphorus; the surface of the strait was overshadowed, in the language of the Greeks, with a moving forest, and the same fatal night had been fixed by the <NORP>Saracen</NORP> chief for a general assault by sea and land.
 To allure the confidence of the enemy, the emperor had thrown aside the chain that usually guarded the entrance of the harbour; but while they hesitated whether they should seize the opportunity, or apprehend the snare, the ministers of destruction were at hand.
 The fire-ships of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were launched against them; the Arabs, their arms, and vessels, were involved in the same flames; the disorderly fugitives were dashed against each other or overwhelmed in the waves; and I no longer find a vestige of the fleet, that had threatened to extirpate the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name.
 A still more fatal and irreparable loss was that of the caliph Soliman, who died of an indigestion, (12) in his camp near <GPE>Kinnisrin</GPE> or <PERSON>Chalcis</PERSON> in Syria, as he was preparing to lead against <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> the remaining forces of the East.
 The brother of <PERSON>Moslemah</PERSON> was succeeded by a kinsman and an enemy; and the throne of an active and able prince was degraded by the useless and pernicious virtues of a bigot.
 ! While he started and satisfied the scruples of a blind conscience, the siege was continued through the <DATE>winter</DATE> by the neglect, rather than by the resolution of the caliph Omar.
 (13) The <DATE>winter</DATE> proved uncommonly rigorous: above a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> days the ground was covered with deep snow, and the natives of the sultry climes of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and <GPE>Arabia</GPE> lay torpid and almost lifeless in their frozen camp.
 They revived on the return of spring; a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> effort had been made in their favour; and their distress was relieved by the arrival of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> numerous fleets, laden with corn, and arms, and soldiers; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> from Alexandria, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> transports and galleys; the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty vessels from the ports of Africa.
 But the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fires were again kindled; and if the destruction was less complete, it was owing to the experience which had taught the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> to remain at a safe distance, or to the perfidy of the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> mariners, who deserted with their ships to the emperor of the Christians.
 The trade and navigation of the capital were restored; and the produce of the fisheries supplied the wants, and even the luxury, of the inhabitants.
 But the calamities of famine and disease were soon felt by the troops of Moslemah, and as the former was miserably assuaged, so the latter was dreadfully propagated, by the pernicious nutriment which hunger compelled them to extract from the most unclean or unnatural food.
 The spirit of conquest, and even of enthusiasm, was extinct: the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> could no longer struggle, beyond their lines, either single or in small parties, without exposing themselves to the merciless retaliation of the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> peasants.
 An army of <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> was attracted from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> by the gifts and promises of Leo; and these savage auxiliaries made some atonement for the evils which they had inflicted on the empire, by the defeat and slaughter of twenty-two thousand Asiatics.
 A report was dexterously scattered, that the Franks, the unknown nations of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world, were arming by sea and land in the defence of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> cause, and their formidable aid was expected with far different sensations in the camp and city.
 Failure and retreat of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> At length, after a siege of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> months, (14) the hopeless <PERSON>Moslemah</PERSON> received from the caliph the welcome permission of retreat.
 The march of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> cavalry over the <GPE>Hellespont</GPE> and through the provinces of Asia, was executed without delay or molestation; but an army of their brethren had been cut in pieces on the side of Bithynia, and the remains of the fleet were so repeatedly damaged by tempest and fire, that only <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> galleys entered the port of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> to relate the tale of their various and almost incredible disasters.
 (15) Invention and use of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire.
 In the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sieges, the deliverance of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> may be chiefly ascribed to the novelty, the terrors, and the real efficacy of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire.
 (16) The important secret of compounding and directing this artificial flame was imparted by Callinicus, a native of <NORP>Heliopolis</NORP> in Syria, who deserted from the service of the caliph to that of the emperor.
 (17) The skill of a chemist and engineer was equivalent to the succour of fleets and armies; and this discovery or improvement of the military art was fortunately reserved for the distressful period, when the degenerate <NORP>Romans</NORP> of the <LOC>East</LOC> were incapable of contending with the warlike enthusiasm and youthful vigour of the Saracens.
 The historian who presumes to analyze this extraordinary composition should suspect his own ignorance and that of his <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> guides, so prone to the marvellous, so careless, and, in this instance, so jealous of the truth.
 From their obscure, and perhaps fallacious, hints it should seem that the principal ingredient of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire was the naphtha, (18) or liquid bitumen, a light, tenacious, and inflammable oil, (19) which springs from the earth, and catches fire as soon as it comes in contact with the air.
 The naphtha was mingled, I know not by what methods or in what proportions, with sulphur and with the pitch that is extracted from evergreen firs.
 (20) From this mixture, which produced a thick smoke and a loud explosion, proceeded a fierce and obstinate flame, which not only rose in perpendicular ascent, but likewise burnt with equal vehemence in descent or lateral progress; instead of being extinguished, it was nourished and quickened by the element of water; and sand, urine, or vinegar, were the only remedies that could damp the fury of this powerful agent, which was justly denominated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> the liquid, or the maritime, fire.
 For the annoyance of the enemy, it was employed with equal effect, by sea and land, in battles or in sieges.
 It was either poured from the rampart in large boilers, or launched in red-hot balls of stone and iron, or darted in arrows and javelins, twisted round with flax and tow, which had deeply imbibed the inflammable oil; sometimes it was deposited in fire-ships, the victims and instruments of a more ample revenge, and was most commonly blown through long tubes of copper which were planted on the prow of a galley, and fancifully shaped into the mouths of savage monsters, that seemed to vomit a stream of liquid and consuming fire.
 This important art was preserved at Constantinople, as the palladium of the state: the galleys and artillerymight occasionally be lent to the allies of Rome; but the composition of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire was concealed with the most jealous scruple, and the terror of the enemies was increased and prolonged by their ignorance and surprise.
 In the treaties of the administration of the empire, the royal author (21) suggests the answers and excuses that might best elude the indiscreet curiosity and importunate demands of the Barbarians.
 They should be told that the mystery of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire had been revealed by an angel to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and greatest of the Constantines, with a sacred injunction, that this gift of Heaven, this peculiar blessing of the Romans, should never be communicated to any foreign nation; that the prince and the subject were alike bound to religious silence under the temporal and spiritual penalties of treason and sacrilege; and that the impious attempt would provoke the sudden and supernatural vengeance of the God of the Christians.
 By these precautions, the secret was confined, above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> of the East; and at the end of the eleventh century, the Pisans, to whom every sea and every art were familiar, suffered the effects, without understanding the composition, of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire.
 It was at length either discovered or stolen by the Mahometans; and, in the holy wars of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Egypt, they retorted an invention, contrived against themselves, on the heads of the Christians.
 A knight, who despised the swords and lances of the Saracens, relates, with heartfelt sincerity, his own fears, and those of his companions, at the sight and sound of the mischievous engine that discharged a torrent of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire, the feu Gregeois, as it is styled by the more early of the <NORP>French</NORP> writers.
 It came flying through the air, says Joinville, (22) like a winged long-tailed dragon, about the thickness of a hogshead, with the report of thunder and the velocity of lightning; and the darkness of the night was dispelled by this deadly illumination.
 The use of the Greek, or, as it might now be called, of the <NORP>Saracen</NORP> fire, was continued to the middle of the <ORDINAL>fourteenth</ORDINAL> century, (23) when the scientific or casual compound of nitre, sulphur, and charcoal, effected a new revolution in the art of war and the history of mankind.
 (24) Invasion of <GPE>France</GPE> by the Arabs, A.
D.
 721, etc <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire might exclude the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> from the eastern entrance of Europe; but in the West, on the side of the Pyrenees, the provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> were threatened and invaded by the conquerors of Spain.
 (25) The decline of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy invited the attack of these insatiate fanatics.
 The descendants of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> had lost the inheritance of his martial and ferocious spirit; and their misfortune or demerit has affixed the epithet of lazy to the last kings of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> race.
 (26) They ascended the throne without power, and sunk into the grave without a name.
 A country palace, in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Compiegne</GPE> (27) was allotted for their residence or prison: but each year, in the <DATE>month</DATE> of March or May, they were conducted in a wagon drawn by oxen to the assembly of the Franks, to give audience to foreign ambassadors, and to ratify the acts of the mayor of the palace.
 That domestic officer was become the minister of the nation and the master of the prince.
 A public employment was converted into the patrimony of a private family: the elder <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> left a king of mature <DATE>years</DATE> under the guardianship of his own widow and her child; and these feeble regents were forcibly dispossessed by the most active of his bastards.
 A government, <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> savage and <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> corrupt, was almost dissolved; and the tributary dukes, and provincial counts, and the territorial lords, were tempted to despise the weakness of the monarch, and to imitate the ambition of the mayor.
 Among these independent chiefs, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most successful was Eudes, duke of Aquitain, who in the southern provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> usurped the authority, and even the title of king.
 The Goths, the Gascons, and the Franks, assembled under the standard of this <NORP>Christian</NORP> hero: he repelled the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invasion of the Saracens; and Zama, lieutenant of the caliph, lost his army and his life under the walls of Thoulouse.
 The ambition of his successors was stimulated by revenge; they repassed the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> with the means and the resolution of conquest.
 The advantageous situation which had recommended <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> (28) as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> colony, was again chosen by the Moslems: they claimed the province of <GPE>Septimania</GPE> or <LOC>Languedoc</LOC> as a just dependence of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> monarchy: the vineyards of <GPE>Gascony</GPE> and the city of <GPE>Bourdeaux</GPE> were possessed by the sovereign of <GPE>Damascus</GPE> and Samarcand; and the south of France, from the mouth of the <NORP>Garonne</NORP> to that of the Rhone, assumed the manners and religion of Arabia.
 Expedition and victories of Abderame, A.
D.
 731.
 But these narrow limits were scorned by the spirit of Abdalraman, or Abderame, who had been restored by the caliph <PERSON>Hashem</PERSON> to the wishes of the soldiers and people of Spain.
 That veteran and daring commander adjudged to the obedience of the prophet whatever yet remained of <GPE>France</GPE> or of Europe; and prepared to execute the sentence, at the head of a formidable host, in the full confidence of surmounting all opposition either of nature or of man.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> care was to suppress a domestic rebel, who commanded the most important passes of the Pyrenees: Manuza, a <NORP>Moorish</NORP> chief, had accepted the alliance of the duke of Aquitain; and Eudes, from a motive of private or public interest, devoted his beauteous daughter to the embraces of the <NORP>African</NORP> misbeliever.
 But the strongest fortresses of <GPE>Cerdagne</GPE> were invested by a superior force; the rebel was overtaken and slain in the mountains; and his widow was sent a captive to Damascus, to gratify the desires, or more probably the vanity, of the commander of the faithful.
 From the Pyrenees, <PERSON>Abderame</PERSON> proceeded without delay to the passage of the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and the siege of Arles.
 An army of <NORP>Christians</NORP> attempted the relief of the city: the tombs of their leaders were yet visible in the thirteenth century; and many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of their dead bodies were carried down the rapid stream into the Mediterranean Sea.
 The arms of <PERSON>Abderame</PERSON> were not less successful on the side of the ocean.
 He passed without opposition the <NORP>Garonne</NORP> and Dordogne, which unite their waters in the Gulf of Bourdeaux; but he found, beyond those rivers, the camp of the intrepid Eudes, who had formed a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> army and sustained a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> defeat, so fatal to the Christians, that, according to their sad confession, God alone could reckon the number of the slain.
 The victorious <NORP>Saracen</NORP> overran the provinces of Aquitain, whose <NORP>Gallic</NORP> names are disguised, rather than lost, in the modern appellations of Perigord, Saintonge, and Poitou: his standards were planted on the walls, or at least before the gates, of <LOC>Tours</LOC> and of Sens; and his detachments overspread the kingdom of <GPE>Burgundy</GPE> as far as the well-known cities of <GPE>Lyons</GPE> and Besancon.
 The memory of these devastations (for <PERSON>Abderame</PERSON> did not spare the country or the people) was long preserved by tradition; and the invasion of <GPE>France</GPE> by the <NORP>Moors</NORP> or <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> affords the groundwork of those fables, which have been so wildly disfigured in the romances of chivalry, and so elegantly adorned by the <NORP>Italian</NORP> muse.
 In the decline of society and art, the deserted cities could supply a slender booty to the Saracens; their richest spoil was found in the churches and monasteries, which they stripped of their ornaments and delivered to the flames: and the tutelar saints, both <PERSON>Hilary</PERSON> of <GPE>Poitiers</GPE> and Martin of Tours, forgot their miraculous powers in the defence of their own sepulchres.
 (29) A victorious line of march had been prolonged above a thousand miles from the rock of <GPE>Gibraltar</GPE> to the banks of the Loire; the repetition of an equal space would have carried the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> to the confines of <GPE>Poland</GPE> and the <LOC>Highlands</LOC> of Scotland; the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> is not more impassable than the <LOC>Nile</LOC> or Euphrates, and the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> fleet might have sailed without a naval combat into the mouth of the Thames.
 Perhaps the interpretation of the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> would now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet.
 (30) Defeat of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> by <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> Martel, A.
D.
 732.
 From such calamities was <GPE>Christendom</GPE> delivered by the genius and fortune of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> man.
 Charles, the illegitimate son of the elder Pepin, was content with the titles of mayor or duke of the Franks; but he deserved to become the father of a line of kings.
 In a laborious administration of twenty-four years, he restored and supported the dignity of the throne, and the rebels of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> were successively crushed by the activity of a warrior, who, in the same campaign, could display his banner on the Elbe, the Rhone, and the shores of the ocean.
 In the public danger he was summoned by the voice of his country; and his rival, the duke of Aquitain, was reduced to appear among the fugitives and suppliants.
 This subtle policy is perhaps a refinement of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> writers; and the situation of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> will suggest a more narrow and selfish motive of procrastination — the secret desire of humbling the pride and wasting the provinces of the rebel duke of Aquitain.
 It is yet more probable, that the delays of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> were inevitable and reluctant.
 A standing army was unknown under the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> race; more than <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> the kingdom was now in the hands of the Saracens: according to their respective situation, the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> of <GPE>Neustria</GPE> and <ORG>Austrasia</ORG> were too conscious or too careless of the impending danger; and the voluntary aids of the <NORP>Gepidae</NORP> and <NORP>Germans</NORP> were separated by a long interval from the standard of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> general.
 No sooner had he collected his forces, than he sought and found the enemy in the centre of France, between <LOC>Tours</LOC> and Poitiers.
 His well-conducted march was covered with a range of hills, and <PERSON>Abderame</PERSON> appears to have been surprised by his unexpected presence.
 The nations of Asia, Africa, and Europe, advanced with equal ardour to an encounter which would change the history of the world.
 In the six <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of desultory combat, the horsemen and archers of the <LOC>East</LOC> maintained their advantage: but in the closer onset of the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> day, the <NORP>Orientals</NORP> were oppressed by the strength and stature of the Germans, who, with stout hearts and iron hands, (31) asserted the civil and religious freedom of their posterity.
 The epithet of Martel, the Hammer, which has been added to the name of Charles, is expressive of his weighty and irresistible strokes: the valour of <PERSON>Eudes</PERSON> was excited by resentment and emulation; and their companions, in the eye of history, are the true Peers and <NORP>Paladins</NORP> of <NORP>French</NORP> chivalry.
 After a bloody field, in which <PERSON>Abderame</PERSON> was slain, the Saracens, in the close of the evening, retired to their camp.
 In the disorder and despair of the night, the various tribes of <GPE>Yemen</GPE> and Damascus, of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Spain, were provoked to turn their arms against each other: the remains of their host were suddenly dissolved, and each emir consulted his safety by a hasty and separate retreat.
 At the dawn of the day, the stillness of a hostile camp was suspected by the victorious Christians: on the report of their spies, they ventured to explore the riches of the vacant tents; but if we except some celebrated relics, a small portion of the spoil was restored to the innocent and lawful owners.
 The joyful tidings were soon diffused over the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> world, and the monks of <GPE>Italy</GPE> could affirm and believe that <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty, or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and seventy-five, thousand of the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> had been crushed by the hammer of Charles, (32) while no more than <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christians</NORP> were slain in the field of Tours.
 But this incredible tale is sufficiently disproved by the caution of the <NORP>French</NORP> general, who apprehended the snares and accidents of a pursuit, and dismissed his <NORP>German</NORP> allies to their native forests.
 The inactivity of a conqueror betrays the loss of strength and blood, and the most cruel execution is inflicted, not in the ranks of battle, but on the backs of a flying enemy.
 They retreat before the Franks.
 Yet the victory of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> was complete and final; <PERSON>Aquitain</PERSON> was recovered by the arms of Eudes; the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> never resumed the conquest of Gaul, and they were soon driven beyond the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> by <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> Martel and his valiant race.
 (33) It might have been expected that the saviour of <GPE>Christendom</GPE> would have been canonized, or at least applauded, by the gratitude of the clergy, who are indebted to his sword for their present existence.
 But in the public distress, the mayor of the palace had been compelled to apply the riches, or at least the revenues, of the bishops and abbots, to the relief of the state and the reward of the soldiers.
 His merits were forgotten, his sacrilege alone was remembered, and, in an epistle to a <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> prince, a <NORP>Gallic</NORP> synod presumes to declare that his ancestor was damned; that on the opening of his tomb, the spectators were affrighted by a smell of fire and the aspect of a horrid dragon; and that a saint of the times was indulged with a pleasant vision of the soul and body of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> Martel, burning, to all eternity, in the abyss of hell.
 (34) Elevation of the Abbassides, A.
D.
 746-750.
 The loss of an army, or a province, in the <NORP>Western</NORP> world, was less painful to the court of Damascus, than the rise and progress of a domestic competitor.
 Except among the Syrians, the caliphs of the house of <GPE>Ommiyah</GPE> had never been the objects of the public favour.
 The life of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> recorded their perseverance in idolatry and rebellion: their conversion had been reluctant, their elevation irregular and factious, and their throne was cemented with the most holy and noble blood of Arabia.
 The best of their race, the pious Omar, was dissatisfied with his own title: their personal virtues were insufficient to justify a departure from the order of succession; and the eyes and wishes of the faithful were turned towards the line of Hashem, and the kindred of the apostle of God.
 Of these the <NORP>Fatimites</NORP> were either rash or pusillanimous; but the descendants of <PERSON>Abbas</PERSON> cherished, with courage and discretion, the hopes of their rising fortunes.
 From an obscure residence in Syria, they secretly despatched their agents and missionaries, who preached in the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> provinces their hereditary indefeasible right; and Mohammed, the son of Ali, the son of Abdallah, the son of Abbas, the uncle of the prophet, gave audience to the deputies of Chorasan, and accepted their free gift of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand pieces of gold.
 After the death of Mohammed, the oath of allegiance was administered in the name of his son <PERSON>Ibrahim</PERSON> to a numerous band of votaries, who expected only a signal and a leader; and the governor of <GPE>Chorasan</GPE> continued to deplore his fruitless admonitions and the deadly slumber of the caliphs of Damascus, till he himself, with all his adherents, was driven from the city and palace of Meru, by the rebellious arms of Abu Moslem.
 (35) That maker of kings, the author, as he is named, of the call of the Abbassides, was at length rewarded for his presumption of merit with the usual gratitude of courts.
 A mean, perhaps a foreign, extraction could not repress the aspiring energy of Abu Moslem.
 Jealous of his wives, liberal of his wealth, prodigal of his own blood and of that of others, he could boast with pleasure, and possibly with truth, that he had destroyed six <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand of his enemies; and such was the intrepid gravity of his mind and countenance, that he was never seen to smile except on a day of battle.
 In the visible separation of parties, the green was consecrated to the Fatimites; the <NORP>Ommiades</NORP> were distinguished by the white; and the black, as the most adverse, was naturally adopted by the Abbassides.
 Their turbans and garments were stained with that gloomy colour: <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> black standards, on pike staves <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> cubits long, were borne aloft in the van of Abu Moslem; and their allegorical names of the night and the shadow obscurely represented the indissoluble union and perpetual succession of the line of Hashem.
 From the <LOC>Indus</LOC> to the Euphrates, the <LOC>East</LOC> was convulsed by the quarrel of the white and the black factions: the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> were most frequently victorious; but their public success was clouded by the personal misfortune of their chief.
 The court of Damascus, awakening from a long slumber, resolved to prevent the pilgrimage of Mecca, which <PERSON>Ibrahim</PERSON> had undertaken with a splendid retinue, to recommend himself at once to the favour of the prophet and of the people.
 A detachment of cavalry intercepted his march and arrested his person; and the unhappy Ibrahim, snatched away from the promise of untasted royalty, expired in iron fetters in the dungeons of Haran.
 His <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> younger brothers, <PERSON>Saffah</PERSON> and Almansor, eluded the search of the tyrant, and lay concealed at Cufa, till the zeal of the people and the approach of his <NORP>Eastern</NORP> friends allowed them to expose their persons to the impatient public.
 On Friday, in the dress of a caliph, in the colours of the sect, <PERSON>Saffah</PERSON> proceeded with religious and military pomp to the mosch: ascending the pulpit, he prayed and preached as the lawful successor of Mahomet; and after his departure, his kinsmen bound a willing people by an oath of fidelity.
 But it was on the banks of the Zab, and not in the mosch of Cufa, that this important controversy was determined.
 Every advantage appeared to be on the side of the white faction: the authority of established government; an army of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand soldiers, against a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> part of that number; and the presence and merit of the caliph Mervan, the <ORDINAL>fourteenth</ORDINAL> and last of the house of Ommiyah.
 Before his accession to the throne, he had deserved, by his <NORP>Georgian</NORP> warfare, the honourable epithet of the ass of Mesopotamia; (36) and he might have been ranked amongst the greatest princes, had not, says Abulfeda, the eternal order decreed that moment for the ruin of his family; a decree against which all human fortitude and prudence must struggle in vain.
 The orders of <PERSON>Mervan</PERSON> were mistaken, or disobeyed: the return of his horse, from which he had dismounted on a necessary occasion, impressed the belief of his death; and the enthusiasm of the black squadrons was ably conducted by Abdallah, the uncle of his competitor.
 After an irretrievable defeat, the caliph escaped to Mosul; but the colours of the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> were displayed from the rampart; he suddenly repassed the Tigris, cast a melancholy look on his palace of Haran, crossed the Euphrates, abandoned the fortifications of Damascus, and, without halting in Palestine, pitched his last and fatal camp at Busir, on the banks of the Nile.
 (37) His speed was urged by the incessant diligence of Abdallah, who in every step of the pursuit acquired strength and reputation:Fall of the Ommiades, A.
D.
 750, February <CARDINAL>10</CARDINAL> the remains of the white faction were finally vanquished in Egypt; and the lance, which terminated the life and anxiety of Mervan, was not less welcome perhaps to the unfortunate than to the victorious chief.
 The merciless inquisition of the conqueror eradicated the most distant branches of the hostile race: their bones were scattered, their memory was accursed, and the martyrdom of <PERSON>Hossein</PERSON> was abundantly revenged on the posterity of his tyrants.
 Fourscore of the Ommiades, who had yielded to the faith or clemency of their foes, were invited to a banquet at Damascus.
 The laws of hospitality were violated by a promiscuous massacre: the board was spread over their fallen bodies; and the festivity of the guests was enlivened by the music of their dying groans.
 By the event of the civil war, the dynasty of the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> was firmly established; but the <NORP>Christians</NORP> only could triumph in the mutual hatred and common loss of the disciples of Mahomet.
 (38) Revolt of Spain, A.
D.
 755.
 Yet the <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> who were swept away by the sword of war might have been speedily retrieved in the succeeding generation, if the consequences of the revolution had not tended to dissolve the power and unity of the empire of the Saracens.
 In the proscription of the Ommiades, a royal youth of the name of <NORP>Abdalrahman</NORP> alone escaped the rage of his enemies, who hunted the wandering exile from the banks of the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> to the valleys of Mount Atlas.
 His presence in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Spain</GPE> revived the zeal of the white faction.
 The name and cause of the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> had been <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> vindicated by the Persians: the <LOC>West</LOC> had been pure from civil arms; and the servants of the abdicated family still held, by a precarious tenure, the inheritance of their lands and the offices of government.
 Strongly prompted by gratitude, indignation, and fear, they invited the grandson of the caliph <PERSON>Hashem</PERSON> to ascend the throne of his ancestors; and, in his desperate condition, the extremes of rashness and prudence were almost the same.
 The acclamations of the people saluted his landing on the coast of Andalusia: and, after a successful struggle, <NORP>Abdalrahman</NORP> established the throne of Cordova, and was the father of the <NORP>Ommiades</NORP> of Spain, who reigned above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> from the <LOC>Atlantic</LOC> to the Pyrenees.
 (39) He slew in battle a lieutenant of the Abbassides, who had invaded his dominions with a fleet and army: the head of Ala, in salt and camphire, was suspended by a daring messenger before the palace of Mecca; and the caliph <PERSON>Almansor</PERSON> rejoiced in his safety, that he was removed by seas and lands from such a formidable adversary.
 Their mutual designs or declarations of offensive war evaporated without effect; but instead of opening a door to the conquest of Europe, <GPE>Spain</GPE> was dissevered from the trunk of the monarchy, engaged in perpetual hostility with the East, and inclined to peace and friendship with the <NORP>Christian</NORP> sovereigns of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and France.
 Triple division of the caliphate The example of the <NORP>Ommiades</NORP> was imitated by the real or fictitious progeny of Ali, the <NORP>Edrissites</NORP> of Mauritania, and the more powerful fatimites of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Egypt.
 In the tenth century, the chair of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was disputed by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> caliphs or commanders of the faithful, who reigned at Bagdad, Cairoan, and Cordova, excommunicating each other, and agreed only in a principle of discord, that a sectary is more odious and criminal than an unbeliever.
 (40) Magnificence of the caliphs, A.
D.
 750-960.
 <GPE>Mecca</GPE> was the patrimony of the line of Hashem, yet the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> were never tempted to reside either in the birthplace or the city of the prophet.
 <GPE>Damascus</GPE> was disgraced by the choice, and polluted with the blood, of the Ommiades; and, after some hesitation, Almansor, the brother and successor of Saffah, laid the foundations of Bagdad, (41) the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> seat of his posterity during a reign of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years.
 (42) The chosen spot is on the eastern bank of the Tigris, about <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> miles above the ruins of Modain: the double wall was of a circular form; and such was the rapid increase of a capital, now dwindled to a provincial town, that the funeral of a popular saint might be attended by <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand men and sixty thousand women of <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> and the adjacent villages.
 In this city of peace, (43) amidst the riches of the East, the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> soon disdained the abstinence and frugality of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> caliphs, and aspired to emulate the magnificence of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> kings.
 After his wars and buildings, <PERSON>Almansor</PERSON> left behind him in gold and silver about <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> sterling: (44) and this treasure was exhausted in a few <DATE>years</DATE> by the vices or virtues of his children.
 His son Mahadi, in a single pilgrimage to Mecca, expended six <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of dinars of gold.
 A pious and charitable motive may sanctify the foundation of cisterns and caravanseras, which he distributed along a measured road of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles; but his train of camels, laden with snow, could serve only to astonish the natives of Arabia, and to refresh the fruits and liquors of the royal banquet.
 (45) The courtiers would surely praise the liberality of his grandson Almamon, who gave away <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> fifths of the income of a province, a sum of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand gold dinars, before he drew his foot from the stirrup.
 At the nuptials of the same prince, a thousand pearls of the largest size were showered on the head of the bride, (46) and a lottery of lands and houses displayed the capricious bounty of fortune.
 The glories of the court were brightened, rather than impaired, in the decline of the empire, and a <NORP>Greek</NORP> ambassador might admire, or pity, the magnificence of the feeble Moctader.
 In the West, the <NORP>Ommiades</NORP> of <GPE>Spain</GPE> supported, with equal pomp, the title of commander of the faithful.
 Three miles from Cordova, in honour of his favourite sultana, the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> and greatest of the <NORP>Abdalrahmans</NORP> constructed the city, palace, and gardens of Zehra.
 Twenty-five years, and above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> sterling, were employed by the founder: his liberal taste invited the artists of Constantinople, the most skilful sculptors and architects of the age; and the buildings were sustained or adorned by <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> columns of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> and African, of <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Italian</NORP> marble.
 The hall of audience was encrusted with gold and pearls, and a great basin in the centre was surrounded with the curious and costly figures of birds and quadrupeds.
 In a lofty pavilion of the gardens, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins and fountains, so delightful in a sultry climate, was replenished not with water, but with the purest quicksilver.
 The seraglio of Abdalrahman, his wives, concubines, and black eunuchs, amounted to six thousand <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> persons: and he was attended to the field by a guard of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> thousand horse, whose belts and scymetars were studded with gold.
 (49) Consequences on private and public happiness.
 In a private condition, our desires are perpetually repressed by poverty and subordination; but the lives and labours of <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> are devoted to the service of a despotic prince, whose laws are blindly obeyed, and whose wishes are instantly gratified.
 Our imagination is dazzled by the splendid picture; and whatever may be the cool dictates of reason, there are few among us who would obstinately refuse a trial of the comforts and the cares of royalty.
 It may therefore be of some use to borrow the experience of the same Abdalrahman, whose magnificence has perhaps excited our admiration and envy, and to transcribe an authentic memorial which was found in the closet of the deceased caliph.
 The luxury of the caliphs, so useless to their private happiness, relaxed the nerves, and terminated the progress, of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> empire.
 Temporal and spiritual conquest had been the sole occupation of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> successors of Mahomet; and after supplying themselves with the necessaries of life, the whole revenue was scrupulously devoted to that salutary work.
 The <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> were impoverished by the multitude of their wants, and their contempt of economy.
 Instead of pursuing the great object of ambition, their leisure, their affections, the powers of their mind, were diverted by pomp and pleasure: the rewards of valour were embezzled by women and eunuchs, and the royal camp was encumbered by the luxury of the palace.
 A similar temper was diffused among the subjects of the caliph.
 Their stern enthusiasm was softened by time and prosperity.
 they sought riches in the occupations of industry, fame in the pursuits of literature, and happiness in the tranquillity of domestic life.
 War was no longer the passion of the Saracens; and the increase of pay, the repetition of donatives, were insufficient to allure the posterity of those voluntary champions who had crowded to the standard of <NORP>Abubeker</NORP> and <PERSON>Omar</PERSON> for the hopes of spoil and of paradise.
 Introduction of learning among the Arabians, A.
D.
 754, etc, 813, etc.
 Under the reign of the Ommiades, the studies of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were confined to the interpretation of the Koran, and the eloquence and poetry of their native tongue.
 A people continually exposed to the dangers of the field must esteem the healing powers of medicine, or rather of surgery; but the starving physicians of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> murmured a complaint that exercise and temperance deprived them of the greatest part of their practice.
 (51) After their civil and domestic wars, the subjects of the Abbassides, awakening from this mental lethargy, found leisure and felt curiosity for the acquisition of profane science.
 This spirit was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> encouraged by the caliph Almansor, who, besides his knowledge of the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> law, had applied himself with success to the study of astronomy.
 But when the sceptre devolved to Almamon, the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> of the Abbassides, he completed the designs of his grandfather, and invited the muses from their ancient seats.
 His ambassadors at Constantinople, his agents in Armenia, Syria, and Egypt, collected the volumes of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> science at his command they were translated by the most skilful interpreters into the <LANGUAGE>Arabic</LANGUAGE> language: his subjects were exhorted assiduously to peruse these instructive writings; and the successor of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> assisted with pleasure and modesty at the assemblies and disputations of the learned.
 The zeal and curiosity of <PERSON>Almamon</PERSON> were imitated by succeeding princes of the line of Abbas: their rivals, the <NORP>Fatimites</NORP> of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and the <NORP>Ommiades</NORP> of Spain, were the patrons of the learned, as well as the commanders of the faithful; the same royal prerogative was claimed by their independent emirs of the provinces; and their emulation diffused the taste and the rewards of science from <NORP>Samarcand</NORP> and <PERSON>Bochara</PERSON> to <GPE>Fez</GPE> and Cordova.
 The vizier of a sultan consecrated a sum of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand pieces of gold to the foundation of a college at Bagdad, which he endowed with an annual revenue of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand dinars.
 The fruits of instruction were communicated, perhaps at different times, to six thousand disciples of every degree, from the son of the noble to that of the mechanic: a sufficient allowance was provided for the indigent scholars; and the merit or industry of the professors was repaid with adequate stipends.
 In every city the productions of <LANGUAGE>Arabic</LANGUAGE> literature were copied and collected by the curiosity of the studious and the vanity of the rich.
 A private doctor refused the invitation of the sultan of Bochara, because the carriage of his books would have required <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> camels.
 The royal library of the <NORP>Fatimites</NORP> consisted of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand manuscripts, elegantly transcribed and splendidly bound, which were lent, without jealousy or avarice, to the students of Cairo.
 Yet this collection must appear moderate, if we can believe that the <NORP>Ommiades</NORP> of <GPE>Spain</GPE> had formed a library of six <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand volumes, <CARDINAL>forty-four</CARDINAL> of which were employed in the mere catalogue.
 Their capital, Cordova, with the adjacent towns of Malaga, Almeria, and Murcia, had given birth to more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> writers, and above <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> public libraries were opened in the cities of the <NORP>Andalusian</NORP> kingdom.
 The age of <NORP>Arabian</NORP> learning continued about <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, till the great eruption of the Moguls, and was coeval with the darkest and most slothful period of <NORP>European</NORP> annals; but since the sun of science has arisen in the West, it should seem that the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> studies have languished and declined.
 (54) Their real progress in the sciences.
 In the libraries of the Arabians, as in those of Europe, the far greater part of the innumerable volumes were possessed only of local value or imaginary merit.
 (55) The shelves were crowded with orators and poets, whose style was adapted to the taste and manners of their countrymen; with general and partial histories, which each revolving generation supplied with a new harvest of persons and events; with codes and commentaries of jurisprudence, which derived their authority from the law of the prophet; with the interpreters of the Koran, and orthodox tradition; and with the whole theological tribe, polemics, mystics, scholastics, and moralists, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> or the last of writers, according to the different estimates of sceptics or believers.
 The works of speculation or science may be reduced to the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> classes of philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and physic.
 The sages of <GPE>Greece</GPE> were translated and illustrated in the <LANGUAGE>Arabic</LANGUAGE> language, and some treatises, now lost in the original, have been recovered in the versions of the East, (56) which possessed and studied the writings of <PERSON>Aristotle</PERSON> and Plato, of Euclid and Apollonius, of Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and Galen.
 (57) Among the ideal systems which have varied with the fashion of the times, the <NORP>Arabians</NORP> adopted the philosophy of the Stagirite, alike intelligible or alike obscure for the readers of every age.
 <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> wrote for the Athenians, and his allegorical genius is too closely blended with the language and religion of Greece.
 After the fall of that religion, the Peripatetics, emerging from their obscurity, prevailed in the controversies of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> sects, and their founder was long afterwards restored by the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> of <GPE>Spain</GPE> to the <NORP>Latin</NORP> schools.
 (58) The physics, both of the <ORG>Academy</ORG> and the Lycaeum, as they are built, not on observation, but on argument, have retarded the progress of real knowledge.
 The metaphysics of infinite, or finite, spirit, have too often been enlisted in the service of superstition.
 But the human faculties are fortified by the art and practice of dialectics; the <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> predicaments of <PERSON>Aristotle</PERSON> collect and methodize our ideas, (59) and his syllogism is the keenest weapon of dispute.
 It was dexterously wielded in the schools of the Saracens, but as it is more effectual for the detection of error than for the investigation of truth, it is not surprising that new generations of masters and disciples should still revolve in the same circle of logical argument.
 The mathematics are distinguished by a peculiar privilege, that, in the course of ages, they may always advance, and can never recede.
 But the ancient geometry, if I am not misinformed, was resumed in the same state by the <NORP>Italians</NORP> of the fifteenth century; and whatever may be the origin of the name, the science of algebra is ascribed to the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> Diophantus by the modest testimony of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> themselves.
 (60) They cultivated with more success the sublime science of astronomy, which elevates the mind of man to disdain his diminutive planet and momentary existence.
 The costly instruments of observation were supplied by the caliph Almamon, and the land of the <NORP>Chaldaeans</NORP> still afforded the same spacious level, the same unclouded horizon.
 In the plains of Sinaar, and a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time in those of Cufa, his mathematicians accurately measured a degree of the great circle of the earth, and determined at twenty-four thousand miles the entire circumference of our globe.
 (61) From the reign of the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> to that of the grandchildren of Tamerlane, the stars, without the aid of glasses, were diligently observed; and the astronomical tables of Bagdad, Spain, and Samarcand, (62) correct some minute errors, without daring to renounce the hypothesis of Ptolemy, without advancing a step towards the discovery of the solar system.
 In the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> courts, the truths of science could be recommended only by ignorance and folly, and the astronomer would have been disregarded, had he not debased his wisdom or honesty by the vain predictions of astrology.
 (63) But in the science of medicine, the <NORP>Arabians</NORP> have been deservedly applauded.
 The names of <PERSON>Mesua</PERSON> and Geber, of <GPE>Razis</GPE> and Avicenna, are ranked with the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> masters; in the city of Bagdad, <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty physicians were licensed to exercise their lucrative profession: (64) in Spain, the life of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> princes was entrusted to the skill of the Saracens, (65) and the school of Salerno, their legitimate offspring, revived in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Europe</LOC> the precepts of the healing art.
 (66) The success of each professor must have been influenced by personal and accidental causes; but we may form a less fanciful estimate of their general knowledge of anatomy, (67) botany, (68) and chemistry, (69) the threefold basis of their theory and practice.
 A superstitious reverence for the dead confined both the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the <NORP>Arabians</NORP> to the dissection of apes and quadrupeds; the more solid and visible parts were known in the time of Galen, and the finer scrutiny of the human frame was reserved for the microscope and the injections of modern artists.
 Botany is an active science, and the discoveries of the torrid zone might enrich the herbal of <PRODUCT>Dioscorides</PRODUCT> with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand plants.
 Some traditionary knowledge might be secreted in the temples and monasteries of Egypt; much useful experience had been acquired in the practice of arts and manufactures; but the science of chemistry owes its origin and improvement to the industry of the Saracens.
 They <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invented and named the alembic for the purposes of distillation, analyzed the substances of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> kingdoms of nature, tried the distinction and affinities of alcalis and acids, and converted the poisonous minerals into soft and salutary medicines.
 But the most eager search of <NORP>Arabian</NORP> chemistry was the transmutation of metals, and the elixir of immortal health: the reason and the fortunes of <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> were evaporated in the crucibles of alchemy, and the consummation of the great work was promoted by the worthy aid of mystery, fable, and superstition.
 Want of erudition, taste, and freedom.
.
 But the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> deprived themselves of the principal benefits of a familiar intercourse with <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Rome, the knowledge of antiquity, the purity of taste, and the freedom of thought.
 Confident in the riches of their native tongue, the <NORP>Arabians</NORP> disdained the study of any foreign idiom.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> interpreters were chosen among their <NORP>Christian</NORP> subjects; they formed their translations, sometimes on the original text, more frequently perhaps on a <LANGUAGE>Syriac</LANGUAGE> version; and in the crowd of astronomers and physicians, there is no example of a poet, an orator, or even an historian, being taught to speak the language of the Saracens.
 (70) The mythology of <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> would have provoked the abhorrence of those stern fanatics: they possessed in lazy ignorance the colonies of the Macedonians, and the provinces of <GPE>Carthage</GPE> and Rome: the heroes of <PERSON>Plutarch</PERSON> and <PERSON>Livy</PERSON> were buried in oblivion; and the history of the world before <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was reduced to a short legend of the patriarchs, the prophets, and the <NORP>Persian</NORP> kings.
 Our education in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Latin</NORP> schools may have fixed in our minds a standard of exclusive taste; and I am not forward to condemn the literature and judgment of nations, of whose language I am ignorant.
 Yet I know that the classics have much to teach, and I believe that the <NORP>Orientals</NORP> have much to learn; the temperate dignity of style, the graceful proportions of art, the forms of visible and intellectual beauty, the just delineation of character and passion, the rhetoric of narrative and argument, the regular fabric of epic and dramatic poetry.
 (71) The influence of truth and reason is of a less ambiguous complexion.
 The philosophers of <GPE>Athens</GPE> and <GPE>Rome</GPE> enjoyed the blessings, and asserted the rights, of civil and religious freedom.
 Their moral and political writings might have gradually unlocked the fetters of <NORP>Eastern</NORP> despotism, diffused a liberal spirit of inquiry and toleration, and encouraged the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> sages to suspect that their caliph was a tyrant, and their prophet an impostor.
 (72) The instinct of superstition was alarmed by the introduction even of the abstract sciences; and the more rigid doctors of the law condemned the rash and pernicious curiosity of Almamon.
 (73) To the thirst of martyrdom, the vision of paradise, and the belief of predestination, we must ascribe the invincible enthusiasm of the prince and people.
 And the sword of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> became less formidable when their youth was drawn away from the camp to the college, when the armies of the faithful presumed to read and to reflect.
 Yet the foolish vanity of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> was jealous of their studies, and reluctantly imparted the sacred fire to the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of the East.
 (74) Wars of al Rashid against the Romans, A.
D.
 781-805.
 In the bloody conflict of the <NORP>Ommiades</NORP> and Abbassides, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> had stolen the opportunity of avenging their wrongs and enlarging their limits.
 But a severe retribution was exacted by Mohadi, the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> caliph of the new dynasty, who seized, in his turn, the favourable opportunity, while a woman and a child, <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> and Constantine, were seated on the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne.
 An army of ninety-five thousand <NORP>Persians</NORP> and <NORP>Arabs</NORP> was sent from the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> to the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> Bosphorus, under the command of Harun, (75) or Aaron, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son of the commander of the faithful.
 His encampment on the opposite heights of Chrysopolis, or Scutari, informed Irene, in her palace of Constantinople, of the loss of her troops and provinces.
 With the consent or connivance of their sovereign, her ministers subscribed an ignominious peace; and the exchange of some royal gifts could not disguise the annual tribute of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand dinars of gold, which was imposed on the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> had too rashly advanced into the midst of a distant and hostile land: their retreat was solicited by the promise of faithful guides and plentiful markets; and not a <NORP>Greek</NORP> had courage to whisper, that their weary forces might be surrounded and destroyed in their necessary passage between a slippery mountain and the River Sangarius.
 Five <DATE>years</DATE> after this expedition, <GPE>Harun</GPE> ascended the throne of his father and his elder brother; the most powerful and vigorous monarch of his race, illustrious in the West, as the ally of Charlemagne, and familiar to the most childish readers, as the perpetual hero of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> tales.
 His title to the name of Al Rashid (the Just) is sullied by the extirpation of the generous, perhaps the innocent, Barmecides; yet he could listen to the complaint of a poor widow who had been pillaged by his troops, and who dared, in a passage of the Koran, to threaten the inattentive despot with the judgment of God and posterity.
 His court was adorned with luxury and science; but, in a reign of three-and-twenty years, <GPE>Harun</GPE> repeatedly visited his provinces from <GPE>Chorasan</GPE> to Egypt; <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> times he performed the pilgrimage of Mecca; <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> times he invaded the territories of the Romans; and as often as they declined the payment of the tribute, they were taught to feel that a <DATE>month</DATE> of depredation was more costly than a year of submission.
 But when the unnatural mother of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was deposed and banished, her successor, Nicephorus, resolved to obliterate this badge of servitude and disgrace.
 The epistle of the emperor to the caliph was pointed with an allusion to the game of chess, which had already spread from <GPE>Persia</GPE> to Greece.
 At these words the ambassadors cast a bundle of swords before the foot of the throne.
 The caliph smiled at the menace, and drawing his scymetar, samsamah, a weapon of historic or fabulous renown, he cut asunder the feeble arms of the Greeks, without turning the edge, or endangering the temper, of his blade.
 He then dictated an epistle of tremendous brevity: It was written in characters of blood and fire on the plains of Phrygia; and the warlike celerity of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> could only be checked by the arts of deceit and the show of repentance.
 The triumphant caliph retired, after the fatigues of the campaign, to his favourite palace of <GPE>Racca</GPE> on the Euphrates: (76) but the distance of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles, and the inclemency of the season, encouraged his adversary to violate the peace.
 <GPE>Nicephorus</GPE> was astonished by the bold and rapid march of the commander of the faithful, who repassed, in the depth of winter, the snows of Mount Taurus: his stratagems of policy and war were exhausted; and the perfidious <NORP>Greek</NORP> escaped with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> wounds from a field of battle overspread with <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> thousand of his subjects.
 Yet the emperor was ashamed of submission, and the caliph was resolved on victory.
 One <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and thirty-five thousand regular soldiers received pay, and were inscribed in the military roll; and above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand persons of every denomination marched under the black standard of the Abbassides.
 They swept the surface of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor far beyond <LOC>Tyana</LOC> and Ancyra, and invested the Pontic Heraclea, (77) once a flourishing state, now a paltry town; at that time capable of sustaining, in her antique walls, a month's siege against the forces of the East.
 The ruin was complete, the spoil was ample; but if <GPE>Harun</GPE> had been conversant with <NORP>Grecian</NORP> story, he would have regretted the statue of Hercules, whose attributes, the club, the bow, the quiver, and the lion's hide, were sculptured in massy gold.
 The progress of desolation by sea and land, from the <LOC>Euxine</LOC> to the Isle of Cyprus, compelled the emperor <GPE>Nicephorus</GPE> to retract his haughty defiance.
 In the new treaty, the ruins of <PERSON>Heraclea</PERSON> were left forever as a lesson and a trophy; and the coin of the tribute was marked with the image and superscription of <GPE>Harun</GPE> and his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 (78) Yet this plurality of lords might contribute to remove the dishonour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name.
 After the death of their father, the heirs of the caliph were involved in civil discord, and the conqueror, the liberal Almamon, was sufficiently engaged in the restoration of domestic peace and the introduction of foreign science.
 The <NORP>Arabs</NORP> subdue the isle of Crete, A.
D.
 823.
 Under the reign of <PERSON>Almamon</PERSON> at Bagdad, of Michael the Stammerer at Constantinople, the islands of <GPE>Crete</GPE> (79) and <GPE>Sicily</GPE> were subdued by the Arabs.
 The former of these conquests is disdained by their own writers, who were ignorant of the fame of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> and Minos, but it has not been overlooked by the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historians, who now begin to cast a clearer light on the affairs of their own times.
 (80) A band of <NORP>Andalusian</NORP> volunteers, discontented with the climate or government of Spain, explored the adventures of the sea; but as they sailed in no more than <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> galleys, their warfare must be branded with the name of piracy.
 As the subjects and sectaries of the white party, they might lawfully invade the dominions of the black caliphs.
 A rebellious faction introduced them into Alexandria; (81) they cut in pieces both friends and foes, pillaged the churches and the moschs, sold above six thousand <NORP>Christian</NORP> captives, and maintained their station in the capital of Egypt, till they were oppressed by the forces and the presence of <PERSON>Almamon</PERSON> himself.
 From the mouth of the <LOC>Nile</LOC> to the Hellespont, the islands and sea-coasts both of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were exposed to their depredations; they saw, they envied, they tasted the fertility of Crete, and soon returned with <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> galleys to a more serious attack.
 The <NORP>Andalusians</NORP> wandered over the land fearless and unmolested; but when they descended with their plunder to the sea-shore, their vessels were in flames, and their chief, Abu Caab, confessed himself the author of the mischief.
 Their clamours accused his madness or treachery.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> habitation was their camp, with a ditch and rampart, in the Bay of Suda; but an apostate monk led them to a more desirable position in the eastern parts; and the name of Candax, their fortress and colony, has been extended to the whole island, under the corrupt and modern appellation of Candia.
 The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> cities of the age of <LOC>Minos</LOC> were diminished to thirty; and of these, only one, most probably Cydonia, had courage to retain the substance of freedom and the profession of Christianity.
 The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of <GPE>Crete</GPE> soon repaired the loss of their navy; and the timbers of Mount Ida were launched into the main.
 During a hostile period of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and thirty-eight years, the princes of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> attacked these licentious corsairs with fruitless curses and ineffectual arms.
 and of Sicily, A.
D.
 827-878.
 The loss of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> (82) was occasioned by an act of superstitious rigour.
 An amorous youth, who had stolen a nun from her cloister, was sentenced by the emperor to the amputation of his tongue.
 <PERSON>Euphemius</PERSON> appealed to the reason and policy of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Africa; and soon returned with the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> purple, a fleet of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> ships, and an army of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horse and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand foot.
 They landed at <GPE>Mazara</GPE> near the ruins of the ancient Selinus; but after some partial victories, <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> (83) was delivered by the Greeks, the apostate was slain before her walls, and his <NORP>African</NORP> friends were reduced to the necessity of feeding on the flesh of their own horses.
 In their turn they were relieved by a powerful reinforcement of their brethren of Andalusia; the largest and western part of the island was gradually reduced, and the commodious harbour of <GPE>Palermo</GPE> was chosen for the seat of the naval and military power of the Saracens.
 <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> preserved about <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the faith which she had sworn to <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and to Caesar.
 In the last and fatal siege, her citizens displayed some remnant of the spirit which had formerly resisted the powers of <GPE>Athens</GPE> and Carthage.
 They stood above <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> days against the battering-rams and catapultae, the mines and tortoises of the besiegers; and the place might have been relieved, if the mariners of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> fleet had not been detained at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> in building a church to the Virgin Mary.
 The deacon Theodosius, with the bishop and clergy, was dragged in chains from the altar to Palermo, cast into a subterraneous dungeon, and exposed to the hourly peril of death or apostasy.
 His pathetic, and not inelegant, complaint may be read as the epitaph of his country.
 (84) From the <NORP>Roman</NORP> conquest to this final calamity, Syracuse, now dwindled to the primitive Isle of Ortygea, had insensibly declined.
 Yet the relics were still precious; the plate of the cathedral weighed <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> thousand pounds of silver; the entire spoil was computed at <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> million of pieces of gold, (about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand pounds sterling,) and the captives must outnumber the seventeen thousand Christians, who were transported from the sack of <NORP>Tauromenium</NORP> into <NORP>African</NORP> servitude.
 In Sicily, the religion and language of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were eradicated; and such was the docility of the rising generation, that <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thousand boys were circumcised and clothed on the same day with the son of the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliph.
 The <NORP>Arabian</NORP> squadrons issued from the harbours of Palermo, Biserta, and Tunis; a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> towns of <GPE>Calabria</GPE> and <GPE>Campania</GPE> were attacked and pillaged; nor could the suburbs of <GPE>Rome</GPE> be defended by the name of the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> and apostles.
 Had the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> been united, <GPE>Italy</GPE> must have fallen an easy and glorious accession to the empire of the prophet.
 But the caliphs of <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> had lost their authority in the West; the <PERSON>Aglabites</PERSON> and <NORP>Fatimites</NORP> usurped the provinces of Africa, their emirs of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> aspired to independence; and the design of conquest and dominion was degraded to a repetition of predatory inroads.
 (85) Invasion of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Saracens, A.
D.
 846.
 In the sufferings of prostrate Italy, the name of <GPE>Rome</GPE> awakens a solemn and mournful recollection.
 A fleet of <NORP>Saracens</NORP> from the <NORP>African</NORP> coast presumed to enter the mouth of the Tyber, and to approach a city which even yet, in her fallen state, was revered as the metropolis of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world.
 The gates and ramparts were guarded by a trembling people; but the tombs and temples of St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul were left exposed in the suburbs of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and of the <LOC>Ostian</LOC> way.
 Their invisible sanctity had protected them against the Goths, the Vandals, and the Lombards; but the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> disdained both the gospel and the legend; and their rapacious spirit was approved and animated by the precepts of the Koran.
 The <NORP>Christian</NORP> idols were stripped of their costly offerings; a silver altar was torn away from the shrine of St.
 Peter; and if the bodies or the buildings were left entire, their deliverance must be imputed to the haste, rather than the scruples, of the Saracens.
 In their course along the <NORP>Appian</NORP> way, they pillaged <PERSON>Fundi</PERSON> and besieged Gayeta; but they had turned aside from the walls of Rome, and by their divisions, the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> was saved from the yoke of the prophet of Mecca.
 The same danger still impended on the heads of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people; and their domestic force was unequal to the assault of an <NORP>African</NORP> emir.
 They claimed the protection of their <NORP>Latin</NORP> sovereign; but the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> standard was overthrown by a detachment of the Barbarians: they meditated the restoration of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors; but the attempt was treasonable, and the succour remote and precarious.
 (86) Their distress appeared to receive some aggravation from the death of their spiritual and temporal chief; but the pressing emergency superseded the forms and intrigues of an election; and the unanimous choice of Pope <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Fourth (87) was the safety of the church and city.
 This pontiff was born a Roman; the courage of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ages of the republic glowed in his breast; and, amidst the ruins of his country, he stood erect, like <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the firm and lofty columns that rear their heads above the fragments of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> forum.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of his reign were consecrated to the purification and removal of relics, to prayers and processions, and to all the solemn offices of religion, which served at least to heal the imagination, and restore the hopes, of the multitude.
 The public defence had been long neglected, not from the presumption of peace, but from the distress and poverty of the times.
 As far as the scantiness of his means and the shortness of his leisure would allow, the ancient walls were repaired by the command of Leo; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> towers, in the most accessible stations, were built or renewed; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of these commanded on either side of the Tyber; and an iron chain was drawn across the stream to impede the ascent of a hostile navy.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> were assured of a short respite by the welcome news, that the siege of <GPE>Gayeta</GPE> had been raised, and that a part of the enemy, with their sacrilegious plunder, had perished in the waves.
 Victory and reign of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> IV, A.
D.
 849.
 But the storm, which had been delayed, soon burst upon them with redoubled violence.
 The Aglabite, (88) who reigned in Africa, had inherited from his father a treasure and an army: a fleet of <NORP>Arabs</NORP> and Moors, after a short refreshment in the harbours of Sardinia, cast anchor before the mouth of the Tyber, sixteen miles from the city: and their discipline and numbers appeared to threaten, not a transient inroad, but a serious design of conquest and dominion.
 But the vigilance of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> had formed an alliance with the vassals of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire, the free and maritime states of Gayeta, Naples, and Amalfi; and in the hour of danger, their galleys appeared in the port of <PERSON>Ostia</PERSON> under the command of Caesarius, the son of the <NORP>Neapolitan</NORP> duke, a noble and valiant youth, who had already vanquished the fleets of the Saracens.
 With his principal companions, <PERSON>Caesarius</PERSON> was invited to the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> palace, and the dexterous pontiff affected to inquire their errand, and to accept with joy and surprise their providential succour.
 The city bands, in arms, attended their father to Ostia, where he reviewed and blessed his generous deliverers.
 They kissed his feet, received the communion with martial devotion, and listened to the prayer of Leo, that the same God who had supported St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul on the waves of the sea, would strengthen the hands of his champions against the adversaries of his holy name.
 After a similar prayer, and with equal resolution, the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> advanced to the attack of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> galleys, which preserved their advantageous station along the coast.
 The victory inclined to the side of the allies, when it was less gloriously decided in their favour by a sudden tempest, which confounded the skill and courage of the stoutest mariners.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> were sheltered in a friendly harbour, while the <NORP>Africans</NORP> were scattered and dashed in pieces among the rocks and islands of a hostile shore.
 Those who escaped from shipwreck and hunger neither found, nor deserved, mercy at the hands of their implacable pursuers.
 The sword and the gibbet reduced the dangerous multitude of captives; and the remainder was more usefully employed, to restore the sacred edifices which they had attempted to subvert.
 The pontiff, at the head of the citizens and allies, paid his grateful devotion at the shrines of the apostles; and, among the spoils of this naval victory, <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> <NORP>Arabian</NORP> bows of pure and massy silver were suspended round the altar of the fishermen of Galilee.
 The reign of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Fourth was employed in the defence and ornament of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> state.
 The churches were renewed and embellished: near <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand pounds of silver were consecrated to repair the losses of St.
 Peter; and his sanctuary was decorated with a plate of gold of the weight of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixteen pounds, embossed with the portraits of the pope and emperor, and encircled with a string of pearls.
 Yet this vain magnificence reflects less glory on the character of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> than the paternal care with which he rebuilt the walls of <LOC>Horta</LOC> and Ameria; and transported the wandering inhabitants of <GPE>Centumcellae</GPE> to his new foundation of Leopolis, <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles from the sea- shore.
 (89) By his liberality, a colony of Corsicans, with their wives and children, was planted in the station of Porto, at the mouth of the Tyber: the falling city was restored for their use, the fields and vineyards were divided among the new settlers: their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> efforts were assisted by a gift of horses and cattle; and the hardy exiles, who breathed revenge against the Saracens, swore to live and die under the standard of St.
 Peter.
 The nations of the <LOC>West</LOC> and <LOC>North</LOC> who visited the threshold of the apostles had gradually formed the large and populous suburb of the Vatican, and their various habitations were distinguished, in the language of the times, as the schools of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Goths, of the <NORP>Lombards</NORP> and Saxons.
 But this venerable spot was still open to sacrilegious insult: the design of enclosing it with walls and towers exhausted all that authority could command, or charity would supply: and the pious labor of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> was animated in every season, and at every hour, by the presence of the indefatigable pontiff.
 The love of fame, a generous but worldly passion, Foundation of the Leonine city, A.
D.
 852.
 may be detected in the name of the Leonine city, which he bestowed on the Vatican; yet the pride of the dedication was tempered with <NORP>Christian</NORP> penance and humility.
 The boundary was trod by the bishop and his clergy, barefoot, in sackcloth and ashes; the songs of triumph were modulated to psalms and litanies; the walls were besprinkled with holy water; and the ceremony was concluded with a prayer, that, under the guardian care of the apostles and the angelic host, both the old and the new <GPE>Rome</GPE> might ever be preserved pure, prosperous, and impregnable.
 (90) The Amorian war between <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> and Motassem, A.
D.
 838.
 The emperor Theophilus, son of Michael the Stammerer, was <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most active and high-spirited princes who reigned at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> during the middle age.
 In offensive or defensive war, he marched in person <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times against the Saracens, formidable in his attack, esteemed by the enemy in his losses and defeats.
 In the last of these expeditions he penetrated into Syria, and besieged the obscure town of Sozopetra; the casual birthplace of the caliph Motassem, whose father <GPE>Harun</GPE> was attended in peace or war by the most favoured of his wives and concubines.
 The revolt of a <NORP>Persian</NORP> impostor employed at that moment the arms of the Saracen, and he could only intercede in favour of a place for which he felt and acknowledged some degree of filial affection.
 These solicitations determined the emperor to wound his pride in so sensible a part.
 <PERSON>Sozopetra</PERSON> was levelled with the ground, the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> prisoners were marked or mutilated with ignominious cruelty, and a thousand female captives were forced away from the adjacent territory.
 Among these a matron of the house of <PERSON>Abbas</PERSON> invoked, in an agony of despair, the name of Motassem; and the insults of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> engaged the honour of her kinsman to avenge his indignity, and to answer her appeal.
 Under the reign of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> elder brothers, the inheritance of the youngest had been confined to Anatolia, Armenia, Georgia, and Circassia; this frontier station had exercised his military talents; and among his accidental claims to the name of Octonary, (91) the most meritorious are the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> battles which he gained or fought against the enemies of the Koran.
 In this personal quarrel, the troops of Irak, Syria, and Egypt, were recruited from the tribes of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> hordes; his cavalry might be numerous, though we should deduct some myriads from the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand horses of the royal stables; and the expense of the armament was computed at <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> sterling, or <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand pounds of gold.
 From Tarsus, the place of assembly, the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> advanced in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> divisions along the high road of Constantinople: <PERSON>Motassem</PERSON> himself commanded the centre, and the vanguard was given to his son Abbas, who, in the trial of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> adventures, might succeed with the more glory, or fail with the least reproach.
 In the revenge of his injury, the caliph prepared to retaliate a similar affront.
 The father of <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> was a native of <GPE>Amorium</GPE> (92) in Phrygia: the original seat of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> house had been adorned with privileges and monuments; and, whatever might be the indifference of the people, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> itself was scarcely of more value in the eyes of the sovereign and his court.
 The name of <ORG>AMORIUM</ORG> was inscribed on the shields of the Saracens; and their <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> armies were again united under the walls of the devoted city.
 It had been proposed by the wisest counsellors, to evacuate Amorium, to remove the inhabitants, and to abandon the empty structures to the vain resentment of the Barbarians.
 The emperor embraced the more generous resolution of defending, in a siege and battle, the country of his ancestors.
 When the armies drew near, the front of the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> line appeared to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> eye more closely planted with spears and javelins; but the event of the action was not glorious on either side to the national troops.
 The <NORP>Arabs</NORP> were broken, but it was by the swords of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand Persians, who had obtained service and settlement in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were repulsed and vanquished, but it was by the arrows of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> cavalry; and had not their bowstrings been damped and relaxed by the evening rain, very few of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> could have escaped with the emperor from the field of battle.
 They breathed at Dorylaeum, at the distance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days; and Theophilus, reviewing his trembling squadrons, forgave the common flight both of the prince and people.
 After this discovery of his weakness, he vainly hoped to deprecate the fate of Amorium: the inexorable caliph rejected with contempt his prayers and promises; and detained the <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassadors to be the witnesses of his great revenge.
 They had nearly been the witnesses of his shame.
 The vigorous assaults of fifty- <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> days were encountered by a faithful governor, a veteran garrison, and a desperate people; and the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> must have raised the siege, if a domestic traitor had not pointed to the weakest part of the wall, a place which was decorated with the statues of a lion and a bull.
 The vow of <PERSON>Motassem</PERSON> was accomplished with unrelenting rigour: tired, rather than satiated, with destruction, he returned to his new palace of Samara, in the neighbourhood of Bagdad, while the unfortunate (93) <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> implored the tardy and doubtful aid of his <NORP>Western</NORP> rival the emperor of the Franks.
 Yet in the siege of <GPE>Amorium</GPE> about <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Moslems</NORP> had perished: their loss had been revenged by the slaughter of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand Christians, and the sufferings of an equal number of captives, who were treated as the most atrocious criminals.
 Mutual necessity could sometimes extort the exchange or ransom of prisoners: (94) but in the national and religious conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, peace was without confidence, and war without mercy.
 Quarter was seldom given in the field; those who escaped the edge of the sword were condemned to hopeless servitude, or exquisite torture; and a <NORP>Catholic</NORP> emperor relates, with visible satisfaction, the execution of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Crete, who were flayed alive, or plunged into cauldrons of boiling oil.
 (95) To a point of honour <PERSON>Motassem</PERSON> had sacrificed a flourishing city, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand lives, and the property of millions.
 The same caliph descended from his horse, and dirtied his robe, to relieve the distress of a decrepit old man, who, with his laden ass, had tumbled into a ditch.
 On which of these actions did he reflect with the most pleasure, when he was summoned by the angel of death? (96) Disorders of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> guards, A.
D.
 841-870, etc.
 With Motassem, the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> of the Abbassides, the glory of his family and nation expired.
 When the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> conquerors had spread themselves over the East, and were mingled with the servile crowds of Persia, Syria, and Egypt, they insensibly lost the freeborn and martial virtues of the desert.
 The courage of the <LOC>South</LOC> is the artificial fruit of discipline and prejudice; the active power of enthusiasm had decayed, and the mercenary forces of the caliphs were recruited in those climates of the North, of which valour is the hardy and spontaneous production.
 Of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> (97) who dwelt beyond the <PRODUCT>Oxus</PRODUCT> and Jaxartes, the robust youths, either taken in war or purchased in trade, were educated in the exercises of the field, and the profession of the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> faith.
 The <NORP>Turkish</NORP> guards stood in arms round the throne of their benefactor, and their chiefs usurped the dominion of the palace and the provinces.
 Motassem, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> author of this dangerous example, introduced into the capital above <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand Turks: their licentious conduct provoked the public indignation, and the quarrels of the soldiers and people induced the caliph to retire from Bagdad, and establish his own residence and the camp of his <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> favourites at <PERSON>Samara</PERSON> on the Tigris, about <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> leagues above the city of Peace.
 (98) His son <PERSON>Motawakkel</PERSON> was a jealous and cruel tyrant: odious to his subjects, he cast himself on the fidelity of the strangers, and these strangers, ambitious and apprehensive, were tempted by the rich promise of a revolution.
 At the instigation, or at least in the cause of his son, they burst into his apartment at the hour of supper, and the caliph was cut into <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> pieces by the same swords which he had recently distributed among the guards of his life and throne.
 To this throne, yet streaming with a father's blood, <PERSON>Montasser</PERSON> was triumphantly led; but in a reign of six months, he found only the pangs of a guilty conscience.
 If he wept at the sight of an old tapestry which represented the crime and punishment of the son of Chosroes, if his days were abridged by grief and remorse, we may allow some pity to a parricide, who exclaimed, in the bitterness of death, that he had lost both this world and the world to come.
 After this act of treason, the ensigns of royalty, the garment and walking-staff of Mahomet, were given and torn away by the foreign mercenaries, who in <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> created, deposed, and murdered, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> commanders of the faithful.
 As often as the <NORP>Turks</NORP> were inflamed by fear, or rage, or avarice, these caliphs were dragged by the feet, exposed naked to the scorching sun, beaten with iron clubs, and compelled to purchase, by the abdication of their dignity, a short reprieve of inevitable fate.
 (99) At length, however, the fury of the tempest was spent or diverted: the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> returned to the less turbulent residence of Bagdad; the insolence of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> was curbed with a firmer and more skilful hand, and their numbers were divided and destroyed in foreign warfare.
 But the nations of the <LOC>East</LOC> had been taught to trample on the successors of the prophet; and the blessings of domestic peace were obtained by the relaxation of strength and discipline.
 So uniform are the mischiefs of military despotism, that I seem to repeat the story of the praetorians of Rome.
 (100) Rise and progress of the Carmathians, A.
D.
 890-951.
 While the flame of enthusiasm was damped by the business, the pleasure, and the knowledge, of the age, it burnt with concentrated heat in the breasts of the chosen few, the congenial spirits, who were ambitious of reigning either in this world or in the next.
 How carefully soever the book of prophecy had been sealed by the apostle of Mecca, the wishes, and (if we may profane the word) even the reason, of fanaticism might believe that, after the successive missions of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Mahomet, the same God, in the fullness of time, would reveal a still more perfect and permanent law.
 In the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and seventy-seventh year of the Hegira, and in the neighbourhood of Cufa, an <NORP>Arabian</NORP> preacher, of the name of Carmath, assumed the lofty and incomprehensible style of the Guide, the Director, the Demonstration, the Word, the Holy Ghost, the Camel, the Herald of the Messiah, who had conversed with him in a human shape, and the representative of <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> the son of Ali, of St.
 John the Baptist, and of the angel Gabriel.
 In his mystic volume, the precepts of the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> were refined to a more spiritual sense: he relaxed the duties of ablution, fasting, and pilgrimage; allowed the indiscriminate use of wine and forbidden food; and nourished the fervour of his disciples by the daily repetition of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> prayers.
 The idleness and ferment of the rustic crowd awakened the attention of the magistrates of Cufa; a timid persecution assisted the progress of the new sect; and the name of the prophet became more revered after his person had been withdrawn from the world.
 His <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> apostles dispersed themselves among the Bedoweens, and the success of their preaching seemed to threaten <GPE>Arabia</GPE> with a new revolution.
 The <NORP>Carmathians</NORP> were ripe for rebellion, since they disclaimed the title of the house of Abbas, and abhorred the worldly pomp of the caliphs of Bagdad.
 They were susceptible of discipline, since they vowed a blind and absolute submission to their Imam, who was called to the prophetic office by the voice of God and the people.
 Instead of the legal tithes, he claimed the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> of their substance and spoil; the most flagitious sins were no more than the type of disobedience; and the brethren were united and concealed by an oath of secrecy.
 Their miltary exploits, A.
D.
 900, etc.
 After a bloody conflict, they prevailed in the province of Bahrein, along the <NORP>Persian</NORP> Gulf: far and wide, the tribes of the desert were subject to the sceptre, or rather to the sword of Abu Said and his son Abu Taher; and these rebellious imams could muster in the field a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand fanatics.
 The mercenaries of the caliph were dismayed at the approach of an enemy who neither asked nor accepted quarter; and the difference between them, in fortitude and patience, is expressive of the change which <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> centuries of prosperity had effected in the character of the Arabians.
 Such troops were discomfited in every action; the cities of <GPE>Racca</GPE> and Baalbec, of <GPE>Cufa</GPE> and Bassora, were taken and pillaged; <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> was filled with consternation; and the caliph trembled behind the veils of his palace.
 In a daring inroad beyond the Tigris, Abu <PERSON>Taher</PERSON> advanced to the gates of the capital with no more than <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horse.
 By the special order of Moctader, the bridges had been broken down, and the person or head of the rebel was expected every hour by the commander of the faithful.
 His lieutenant, from a motive of fear or pity, apprised Abu <PERSON>Taher</PERSON> of his danger, and recommended a speedy escape.
 at the same instant, turning to <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> of his companions, he commanded the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to plunge a dagger into his breast, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> to leap into the Tigris, and the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> to cast himself headlong down a precipice.
 They obeyed without a murmur.
 Before the evening, the camp was surprised, and the menace was executed.
 The rapine of the <NORP>Carmathians</NORP> was sanctified by their aversion to the worship of Mecca: they robbed a caravan of pilgrims, and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand devout <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were abandoned on the burning sands to a death of hunger and thirst.
 Another year they suffered the pilgrims to proceed without interruption; They pillage Mecca, A.
D.
 929.
 but, in the festival of devotion, Abu <PERSON>Taher</PERSON> stormed the holy city, and trampled on the most venerable relics of the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> faith.
 Thirty thousand citizens and strangers were put to the sword; the sacred precincts were polluted by the burial of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand dead bodies; the well of <GPE>Zemzem</GPE> overflowed with blood; the golden spout was forced from its place; the veil of the <NORP>Caaba</NORP> was divided among these impious sectaries; and the black stone, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> monument of the nation, was borne away in triumph to their capital.
 After this deed of sacrilege and cruelty, they continued to infest the confines of Irak, Syria, and Egypt: but the vital principle of enthusiasm had withered at the root.
 Their scruples, or their avarice, again opened the pilgrimage of Mecca, and restored the black stone of the Caaba; and it is needless to inquire into what factions they were broken, or by whose swords they were finally extirpated.
 The sect of the <NORP>Carmathians</NORP> may be considered as the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> visible cause of the decline and fall of the empire of the caliphs.
 (101) Revolt of the provinces, A.
D.
 800-936.
 The <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> and most obvious cause was the weight and magnitude of the empire itself.
 The caliph <PERSON>Almamon</PERSON> might proudly assert, that it was easier for him to rule the <LOC>East</LOC> and the West, than to manage a chess-board of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> feet square: (102) yet I suspect that in both those games he was guilty of many fatal mistakes; and I perceive, that in the distant provinces the authority of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most powerful of the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> was already impaired.
 The analogy of despotism invests the representative with the full majesty of the prince; the division and balance of powers might relax the habits of obedience, might encourage the passive subject to inquire into the origin and administration of civil government.
 He who is born in the purple is seldom worthy to reign; but the elevation of a private man, of a peasant, perhaps, or a slave, affords a strong presumption of his courage and capacity.
 The viceroy of a remote kingdom aspires to secure the property and inheritance of his precarious trust; the nations must rejoice in the presence of their sovereign; and the command of armies and treasures are at once the object and the instrument of his ambition.
 A change was scarcely visible as long as the lieutenants of the caliph were content with their vicarious title; while they solicited for themselves or their sons a renewal of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> grant, and still maintained on the coin and in the public prayers the name and prerogative of the commander of the faithful.
 But in the long and hereditary exercise of power, they assumed the pride and attributes of royalty; the alternative of peace or war, of reward or punishment, depended solely on their will; and the revenues of their government were reserved for local services or private magnificence.
 Instead of a regular supply of men and money, the successors of the prophet were flattered with the ostentatious gift of an elephant, or a cast of hawks, a suit of silk hangings, or some pounds of musk and amber.
 (103) The independent dynasties.
 After the revolt of <GPE>Spain</GPE> from the temporal and spiritual supremacy of the Abbassides, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> symptoms of disobedience broke forth in the province of Africa.
 Ibrahim, the son of Aglab, the lieutenant of the vigilant and rigid Harun, bequeathed to the dynasty of A.
D.
 800-941.
 the <PERSON>Aglabites</PERSON> the inheritance of his name and power.
 The indolence or policy of the caliphs dissembled the injury and loss, and pursued only with poison the founder of A.
D.
 829-907.
 the Edrisites, (104) who erected the kingdom and city of <GPE>Fez</GPE> on the shores of the <NORP>Western</NORP> ocean.
 (105) In the East, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> dynasty was that of A.
D.
 813-872.
 the Taherites; (106) the posterity of the valiant Taher, who, in the civil wars of the sons of Harun, had served with too much zeal and success the cause of Almamon, the younger brother.
 He was sent into honourable exile, to command on the banks of the Oxus; and the independence of his successors, who reigned in <GPE>Chorasan</GPE> till the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> generation, was palliated by their modest and respectful demeanour, the happiness of their subjects and the security of their frontier.
 They were supplanted by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of those adventures so frequent in the annals of the East, who left his trade of a brazier (from whence the name of A.
D.
 872-902.
 Soffarides) for the profession of a robber.
 In a nocturnal visit to the treasure of the prince of Sistan, Jacob, the son of Leith, stumbled over a lump of salt, which he unwarily tasted with his tongue.
 Salt, among the Orientals, is the symbol of hospitality, and the pious robber immediately retired without spoil or damage.
 The discovery of this honourable behaviour recommended <PERSON>Jacob</PERSON> to pardon and trust; he led an army at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> for his benefactor, at last for himself, subdued Persia, and threatened the residence of the Abbassides.
 On his march towards Bagdad, the conqueror was arrested by a fever.
 He gave audience in bed to the ambassador of the caliph; and beside him on a table were exposed a naked scymetar, a crust of brown bread, and a bunch of onions.
 From the height where he stood, the descent would not have been so soft or harmless: a timely death secured his own repose and that of the caliph, who paid with the most lavish concessions the retreat of his brother <PERSON>Amrou</PERSON> to the palaces of <GPE>Shiraz</GPE> and Ispahan.
 The <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> were too feeble to contend, too proud to forgive: they invited the powerful dynasty of A.
D.
 874-999.
 the Samanides, who passed the <PRODUCT>Oxus</PRODUCT> with <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand horse so poor, that their stirrups were of wood: so brave, that they vanquished the <NORP>Soffarian</NORP> army, <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> times more numerous than their own.
 The captive <PERSON>Amrou</PERSON> was sent in chains, a grateful offering to the court of Bagdad; and as the victor was content with the inheritance of <NORP>Transoxiana</NORP> and Chorasan, the realms of <GPE>Persia</GPE> returned for a while to the allegiance of the caliphs.
 The provinces of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and <GPE>Egypt</GPE> were twice dismembered by their <NORP>Turkish</NORP> slaves, The Toulonides, A.
D.
 868-905.
 of the race of <GPE>Toulon</GPE> and Ilkshid.
 The Ikshidites, A.
D.
 934-968.
 (107) These Barbarians, in religion and manners the countrymen of Mahomet, emerged from the bloody factions of the palace to a provincial command and an independent throne: their names became famous and formidable in their time; but the founders of these <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> potent dynasties confessed, either in words or actions, the vanity of ambition.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> on his death-bed implored the mercy of God to a sinner, ignorant of the limits of his own power: the second, in the midst of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand soldiers and <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> thousand slaves, concealed from every human eye the chamber where he attempted to sleep.
 Their sons were educated in the vices of kings; and both <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and <GPE>Syria</GPE> were recovered and possessed by the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> during an interval of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years.
 In the decline of their empire, Mesopotamia, with the important cities of <GPE>Mosul</GPE> and Aleppo, was occupied by the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> princes of the tribe of The Hamadanites, A.
D.
 892-1001.
 Hamadan.
 The poets of their court could repeat without a blush, that nature had formed their countenances for beauty, their tongues for eloquence, and their hands for liberality and valour: but the genuine tale of the elevation and reign of the <NORP>Hamadanites</NORP> exhibits a scene of treachery, murder, and parricide.
 At the same fatal period, the <NORP>Persian</NORP> kingdom was again usurped by the dynasty of A.
D.
 933-1055.
 the Bowides, by the sword of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> brothers, who, under various names, were styled the support and columns of the state, and who, from the Caspian Sea to the ocean, would suffer no tyrants but themselves.
 Under their reign, the language and genius of <GPE>Persia</GPE> revived, and the Arabs, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> after the death of Mahomet, were deprived of the sceptre of the East.
 Fallen state of the caliphs of Bagdad, A.
D.
 936, etc.
 Rahadi, the <ORDINAL>twentieth</ORDINAL> of the Abbassides, and the <CARDINAL>thirty-ninth</CARDINAL> of the successors of Mahomet, was the last who deserved the title of commander of the faithful; (108) the last (says Abulfeda) who spoke to the people, or conversed with the learned; the last who, in the expense of his household, represented the wealth and magnificence of the ancient caliphs.
 After him, the lords of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> world were reduced to the most abject misery, and exposed to the blows and insults of a servile condition.
 The revolt of the provinces circumscribed their dominions within the walls of Bagdad: but that capital still contained an innumerable multitude, vain of their past fortune, discontented with their present state, and oppressed by the demands of a treasury which had formerly been replenished by the spoil and tribute of nations.
 Their idleness was exercised by faction and controversy.
 Under the mask of piety, the rigid followers of <PERSON>Hanbal</PERSON> (109) invaded the pleasures of domestic life, burst into the houses of plebeians and princes, the wine, broke the instruments, beat the musicians, and dishonoured, with infamous suspicions, the associates of every handsome youth.
 In each profession, which allowed room for <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> persons, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> was a votary, the other an antagonist, of Ali; and the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> were awakened by the clamorous grief of the sectaries, who denied their title, and cursed their progenitors.
 A turbulent people could only be repressed by a military force; but who could satisfy the avarice or assert the discipline of the mercenaries themselves? The <NORP>African</NORP> and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> guards drew their swords against each other, and the chief commanders, the emirs al Omra, (110) imprisoned or deposed their sovereigns, and violated the sanctuary of the mosch and harem.
 If the caliphs escaped to the camp or court of any neighbouring prince, their deliverance was a change of servitude, till they were prompted by despair to invite the Bowides, the sultans of Persia, who silenced the factions of <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> by their irresistible arms.
 The civil and military powers were assumed by Moezaldowlat, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> brothers, and a stipend of sixty thousand pounds sterling was assigned by his generosity for the private expense of the commander of the faithful.
 But on the fortieth day, at the audience of the ambassadors of Chorasan, and in the presence of a trembling multitude, the caliph was dragged from his throne to a dungeon, by the command of the stranger, and the rude hands of his Dilamites.
 His palace was pillaged, his eyes were put out, and the mean ambition of the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> aspired to the vacant station of danger and disgrace.
 In the school of adversity, the luxurious caliphs resumed the grave and abstemious virtues of the primitive times.
 Despoiled of their armour and silken robes, they fasted, they prayed, they studied the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> and the tradition of the Sonnites: they performed, with zeal and knowledge, the functions of their ecclesiastical character.
 The respect of nations still waited on the successors of the apostle, the oracles of the law and conscience of the faithful; and the weakness or division of their tyrants sometimes restored the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> to the sovereignty of Bagdad.
 But their misfortunes had been embittered by the triumph of the Fatimites, the real or spurious progeny of Ali.
 Arising from the extremity of Africa, these successful rivals extinguished, in <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Syria, both the spiritual and temporal authority of the Abbassides; and the monarch of the <LOC>Nile</LOC> insulted the humble pontiff on the banks of the Tigris.
 Enterprises of the Greeks, A.
D.
 960.
 In the declining age of the caliphs, in the century which elapsed after the war of <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> and Motassem, the hostile transactions of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations were confined to some inroads by sea and land, the fruits of their close vicinity and indelible hatred.
 But when the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> world was convulsed and broken, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were roused from their lethargy by the hopes of conquest and revenge.
 The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire, since the accession of the <NORP>Basilian</NORP> race, had reposed in peace and dignity; and they might encounter with their entire strength the front of some petty emir, whose rear was assaulted and threatened by his national foes of the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> faith.
 The lofty titles of the <TIME>morning</TIME> star, and the death of the Saracens, (111) were applied in the public acclamations to <GPE>Nicephorus</GPE> Phocas, a prince as renowned in the camp, as he was unpopular in the city.
 In the subordinate station of great domestic, or general of the East, Reduction of Crete.
 he reduced the Island of Crete, and extirpated the nest of pirates who had so long defied, with impunity, the majesty of the empire.
 (112) His military genius was displayed in the conduct and success of the enterprise, which had so often failed with loss and dishonour.
 The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were confounded by the landing of his troops on safe and level bridges, which he cast from the vessels to the shore.
 Seven months were consumed in the siege of Candia; the despair of the native <NORP>Cretans</NORP> was stimulated by the frequent aid of their brethren of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Spain; and after the massy wall and double ditch had been stormed by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> a hopeless conflict was still maintained in the streets and houses of the city.
 The whole island was subdued in the capital, and a submissive people accepted, without resistance, the baptism of the conqueror.
 (113) <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> applauded the long-forgotten pomp of a triumph; but the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> diadem was the sole reward that could repay the services, or satisfy the ambition, of Nicephorus.
 The <NORP>Eastern</NORP> conquests of <GPE>Nicephorus</GPE> Phocas and John Zimisces, A.
D.
 963-975.
 After the death of the younger Romanus, the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> in lineal descent of the <NORP>Basilian</NORP> race, his widow <PERSON>Theophania</PERSON> successively married <GPE>Nicephorus</GPE> Phocas and his assassin John Zimisces, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> heroes of the age.
 They reigned as the guardians and colleagues of her infant sons; and the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> of their military command form the most splendid period of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> annals.
 The subjects and confederates, whom they led to war, appeared, at least in the eyes of an enemy, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand strong; and of these about <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand were armed with cuirasses: (114) a train of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand mules attended their march; and their evening camp was regularly fortified with an enclosure of iron spikes.
 A series of bloody and undecisive combats is nothing more than an anticipation of what would have been effected in a few <DATE>years</DATE> by the course of nature; but I shall briefly prosecute the conquests of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors from the hills of <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> to the desert of Bagdad.
 The sieges of <NORP>Mopsuestia</NORP> and Tarsus, Cilicia.
 in Cilicia, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exercised the skill and perseverance of their troops, on whom, at this moment, I shall not hesitate to bestow the name of Romans.
 In the double city of Mopsuestia, which is divided by the River Sarus, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were predestined to death or slavery, (115) a surprising degree of population, which must at least include the inhabitants of the dependent districts.
 They were surrounded and taken by assault; but <GPE>Tarsus</GPE> was reduced by the slow progress of famine; and no sooner had the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> yielded on honourable terms than they were mortified by the distant and unprofitable view of the naval succours of Egypt.
 They were dismissed with a safe-conduct to the confines of Syria: a part of the old <NORP>Christians</NORP> had quietly lived under their dominion; and the vacant habitations were replenished by a new colony.
 But the mosch was converted into a stable; the pulpit was delivered to the flames; many rich crosses of gold and gems, the spoils of <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> churches, were made a grateful offering to the piety or avarice of the emperor; and he transported the gates of <NORP>Mopsuestia</NORP> and Tarsus, which were fixed in the walls of Constantinople, an eternal monument of his victory.
 After they had forced and secured the narrow passes of Mount Amanus, Invasion of Syria.
 the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes repeatedly carried their arms into the heart of Syria.
 Yet, instead of assaulting the walls of Antioch, the humanity or superstition of <GPE>Nicephorus</GPE> appeared to respect the ancient metropolis of the East: he contented himself with drawing round the city a line of circumvallation; left a stationary army; and instructed his lieutenant to expect, without impatience, the return of spring.
 But in the depth of winter, in a dark and rainy night, an adventurous subaltern, with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, approached the rampart, applied his scaling-ladders, occupied <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> adjacent towers, stood firm against the pressure of multitudes, and bravely maintained his post till he was relieved by the tardy, though effectual, support of his reluctant chief.
 Recovery of Antioch.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tumult of slaughter and rapine subsided; the reign of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was restored; and the efforts of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand Saracens, of the armies of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and the fleets of Africa, were consumed without effect before the walls of Antioch.
 The royal city of <GPE>Aleppo</GPE> was subject to Seifeddowlat, of the dynasty of Hamadan, who clouded his past glory by the precipitate retreat which abandoned his kingdom and capital to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> invaders.
 In his stately palace, that stood without the walls of Aleppo, they joyfully seized a well-furnished magazine of arms, a stable of fourteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> mules, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> bags of silver and gold.
 But the walls of the city withstood the strokes of their battering-rams: and the besiegers pitched their tents on the neighbouring mountain of Jaushan.
 Their retreat exasperated the quarrel of the townsmen and mercenaries; the guard of the gates and ramparts was deserted; and while they furiously charged each other in the market-place, they were surprised and destroyed by the sword of a common enemy.
 The male sex was exterminated by the sword; <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand youths were led into captivity; the weight of the precious spoil exceeded the strength and number of the beasts of burden; the superfluous remainder was burnt; and, after a licentious possession of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> marched away from the naked and bleeding city.
 In their <NORP>Syrian</NORP> inroads they commanded the husbandmen to cultivate their lands, that they themselves, in the ensuing season, might reap the benefit; more than a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> cities were reduced to obedience; and <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> pulpits of the principal moschs were committed to the flames to expiate the sacrilege of the disciples of Mahomet.
 The classic names of Hierapolis, Apamea, and Emesa, revive for a moment in the list of conquest: the emperor <NORP>Zimisces</NORP> encamped in the paradise of Damascus, and accepted the ransom of a submissive people; and the torrent was only stopped by the impregnable fortress of Tripoli, on the sea-coast of Phoenicia.
 Passage of the Euphrates.
 Since the days of Heraclius, the Euphrates, below the passage of Mount Taurus, had been impervious, and almost invisible, to the Greeks.
 The river yielded a free passage to the victorious Zimisces; and the historian may imitate the speed with which he overran the once famous cities of Samosata, Edessa, Martyropolis, Amida, (116) and Nisibis, the ancient limit of the empire in the neighbourhood of the Tigris.
 His ardour was quickened by the desire of grasping the virgin treasures of Ecbatana, (117) a well-known name, under which the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> writer has concealed the capital of the Abbassides.
 The consternation of the fugitives had already diffused the terror of his name; but the fancied riches of <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> had already been dissipated by the avarice and prodigality of domestic tyrants.
 Danger of Bagdad.
 The prayers of the people, and the stern demands of the lieutenant of the Bowides, required the caliph to provide for the defence of the city.
 The helpless <PERSON>Mothi</PERSON> replied, that his arms, his revenues, and his provinces, had been torn from his hands, and that he was ready to abdicate a dignity which he was unable to support.
 The emir was inexorable; the furniture of the palace was sold; and the paltry price of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> thousand pieces of gold was instantly consumed in private luxury.
 But the apprehensions of <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> were relieved by the retreat of the Greeks: thirst and hunger guarded the desert of Mesopotamia; and the emperor, satiated with glory, and laden with <NORP>Oriental</NORP> spoils, returned to Constantinople, and displayed, in his triumph, the silk, the aromatics, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> myriads of gold and silver.
 Yet the powers of the <LOC>East</LOC> had been bent, not broken, by this transient hurricane.
 After the departure of the Greeks, the fugitive princes returned to their capitals; the subjects disclaimed their involuntary oaths of allegiance; the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> again purified their temples, and overturned the idols of the saints and martyrs; the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> and <NORP>Jacobites</NORP> preferred a <NORP>Saracen</NORP> to an orthodox master; and the numbers and spirit of the <PERSON>Melchites</PERSON> were inadequate to the support of the church and state.
 Of these extensive conquests, Antioch, with the cities of <GPE>Cilicia</GPE> and the Isle of Cyprus, was alone restored, a permanent and useful accession to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (118)
