D.
 <CARDINAL>533</CARDINAL> When <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> ascended the throne, about <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years after the fall of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, the kingdoms of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and <NORP>Vandals</NORP> had obtained a solid, and, as it might seem, a legal establishment both in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Africa.
 The titles, which <NORP>Roman</NORP> victory had inscribed, were erased with equal justice by the sword of the Barbarians; and their successful rapine derived a more venerable sanction from time, from treaties, and from the oaths of fidelity, already repeated by a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> or <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> generation of obedient subjects.
 Experience and <NORP>Christianity</NORP> had refuted the superstitious hope, that <GPE>Rome</GPE> was founded by the gods to reign forever over the nations of the earth.
 But the proud claim of perpetual and indefeasible dominion, which her soldiers could no longer maintain, was firmly asserted by her statesmen and lawyers, whose opinions have been sometimes revived and propagated in the modern schools of jurisprudence.
 After <GPE>Rome</GPE> herself had been stripped of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> purple, the princes of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> assumed the sole and sacred sceptre of the monarchy; demanded, as their rightful inheritance, the provinces which had been subdued by the consuls, or possessed by the Caesars; and feebly aspired to deliver their faithful subjects of the <LOC>West</LOC> from the usurpation of heretics and Barbarians.
 The execution of this splendid design was in some degree reserved for Justinian.
 During the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> years of his reign, he reluctantly waged a costly and unprofitable war against the Persians; till his pride submitted to his ambition, and he purchased at the price of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred and forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling, the benefit of a precarious truce, which, in the language of both nations, was dignified with the appellation of the endless peace.
 The safety of the <LOC>East</LOC> enabled the emperor to employ his forces against the Vandals; and the internal state of <LOC>Africa</LOC> afforded an honourable motive, and promised a powerful support, to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms.
 (1) State of the VandalsDebates on the <NORP>African</NORP> war.
 The report of an <NORP>African</NORP> war was grateful only to the vain and idle populace of Constantinople, whose poverty exempted them from tribute, and whose cowardice was seldom exposed to military service.
 But the wiser citizens, who judged of the future by the past, revolved in their memory the immense loss, both of men and money, which the empire had sustained in the expedition of Basiliscus.
 The troops, which, after <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> laborious campaigns, had been recalled from the <NORP>Persian</NORP> frontier, dreaded the sea, the climate, and the arms of an unknown enemy.
 The ministers of the finances computed, as far as they might compute, the demands of an <NORP>African</NORP> war; the taxes which must be found and levied to supply those insatiate demands; and the danger, lest their own lives, or at least their lucrative employments, should be made responsible for the deficiency of the supply.
 Inspired by such selfish motives, (for we may not suspect him of any zeal for the public good,) <PERSON>John</PERSON> of <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> ventured to oppose in full council the inclinations of his master.
 He confessed, that a victory of such importance could not be too dearly purchased; but he represented in a grave discourse the certain difficulties and the uncertain event.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> felt the weight of this salutary advice; he was confounded by the unwonted freedom of an obsequious servant; and the design of the war would perhaps have been relinquished, if his courage had not been revived by a voice which silenced the doubts of profane reason.
 The emperor, might be tempted, and his counsellors were constrained, to give credit to this seasonable revelation: but they derived more rational hope from the revolt, which the adherents of <PERSON>Hilderic</PERSON> or <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> had already excited on the borders of the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> monarchy.
 Pudentius, an <NORP>African</NORP> subject, had privately signified his loyal intentions, and a small military aid restored the province of <GPE>Tripoli</GPE> to the obedience of the Romans.
 The government of <GPE>Sardinia</GPE> had been entrusted to Godas, a valiant <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> he suspended the payment of tribute, disclaimed his allegiance to the usurper, and gave audience to the emissaries of Justinian, who found him master of that fruitful island, at the head of his guards, and proudly invested with the ensigns of royalty.
 The forces of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> were diminished by discord and suspicion; the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies were animated by the spirit of Belisarius; <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of those heroic names which are familiar to every age and to every nation.
 Character and choice of Belisarius.
 The <PERSON>Africanus</PERSON> of new <GPE>Rome</GPE> was born, and perhaps educated, among the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> peasants, (5) without any of those advantages which had formed the virtues of the elder and younger Scipio; a noble origin, liberal studies, and the emulation of a free state.
 The silence of a loquacious secretary may be admitted, to prove that the youth of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> could not afford any subject of praise: he served, most assuredly with valour and reputation, among the private guards of Justinian; and when his patron became emperor, the domestic was promoted to military command.
 After a bold inroad into Persarmenia, in which his glory was shared by a colleague, and his progress was checked by an enemy, <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> repaired to the important station of Dara, where he <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> accepted the service of Procopius, the faithful companion, and diligent historian, of his exploits.
 (6) His services in the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war, A.
D.
 529-532.
 The <PERSON>Mirranes</PERSON> of <GPE>Persia</GPE> advanced, with forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of her best troops, to raze the fortifications of Dara; and signified the day and the hour on which the citizens should prepare a bath for his refreshment, after the toils of victory.
 He encountered an adversary equal to himself, by the new title of General of the East; his superior in the science of war, but much inferior in the number and quality of his troops, which amounted only to twenty-five <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Romans</NORP> and strangers, relaxed in their discipline, and humbled by recent disasters.
 As the level plain of <PERSON>Dara</PERSON> refused all shelter to stratagem and ambush, <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> protected his front with a deep trench, which was prolonged at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> in perpendicular, and afterwards in parallel, lines, to cover the wings of cavalry advantageously posted to command the flanks and rear of the enemy.
 When the <NORP>Roman</NORP> centre was shaken, their well-timed and rapid charge decided the conflict: the standard of <GPE>Persia</GPE> fell; the immortals fled; the infantry threw away their bucklers, and eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the vanquished were left on the field of battle.
 In the next campaign, <GPE>Syria</GPE> was invaded on the side of the desert; and Belisarius, with twenty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men, hastened from <PERSON>Dara</PERSON> to the relief of the province.
 During the whole summer, the designs of the enemy were baffled by his skilful dispositions: he pressed their retreat, occupied each night their camp of the preceding day, and would have secured a bloodless victory, if he could have resisted the impatience of his own troops.
 Their valiant promise was faintly supported in the hour of battle; the right wing was exposed by the treacherous or cowardly desertion of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> Arabs; the Huns, a veteran band of eight hundred warriors, were oppressed by superior numbers; the flight of the <NORP>Isaurians</NORP> was intercepted; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> infantry stood firm on the left; for <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> himself, dismounting from his horse, showed them that intrepid despair was their only safety.
 They turned their backs to the Euphrates, and their faces to the enemy: innumerable arrows glanced without effect from the compact and shelving order of their bucklers; an impenetrable line of pikes was opposed to the repeated assaults of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> cavalry; and after a resistance of many hours, the remaining troops were skilfully embarked under the shadow of the night.
 The <NORP>Persian</NORP> commander retired with disorder and disgrace, to answer a strict account of the lives of so many soldiers, which he had consumed in a barren victory.
 But the fame of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was not sullied by a defeat, in which he alone had saved his army from the consequences of their own rashness: the approach of peace relieved him from the guard of the eastern frontier, and his conduct in the sedition of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> amply discharged his obligations to the emperor.
 When the <NORP>African</NORP> war became the topic of popular discourse and secret deliberation, each of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals was apprehensive, rather than ambitious, of the dangerous honour; but as soon as <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> had declared his preference of superior merit, their envy was rekindled by the unanimous applause which was given to the choice of Belisarius.
 The temper of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court may encourage a suspicion, that the hero was darkly assisted by the intrigues of his wife, the fair and subtle Antonina, who alternately enjoyed the confidence, and incurred the hatred, of the empress Theodora.
 The birth of <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> was ignoble; she descended from a family of charioteers; and her chastity has been stained with the foulest reproach.
 Yet she reigned with long and absolute power over the mind of her illustrious husband; and if <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> disdained the merit of conjugal fidelity, she expressed a manly friendship to Belisarius, whom she accompanied with undaunted resolution in all the hardships and dangers of a military life.
 (7) Preparations for the <NORP>African</NORP> war, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>533</CARDINAL> The preparations for the <NORP>African</NORP> war were not unworthy of the last contest between <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Carthage.
 The pride and flower of the army consisted of the guards of Belisarius, who, according to the pernicious indulgence of the times, devoted themselves, by a particular oath of fidelity, to the service of their patrons.
 Their strength and stature, for which they had been curiously selected, the goodness of their horses and armour, and the assiduous practice of all the exercises of war, enabled them to act whatever their courage might prompt; and their courage was exalted by the social honour of their rank, and the personal ambition of favour and fortune.
 Four hundred of the bravest of the <PERSON>Heruli</PERSON> marched under the banner of the faithful and active Pharas; their untractable valour was more highly prized than the tame submission of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Syrians; and of such importance was it deemed to procure a reinforcement of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred Massagetae, or Huns, that they were allured by fraud and deceit to engage in a naval expedition.
 Five <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot were embarked at Constantinople, for the conquest of Africa; but the infantry, for the most part levied in <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Isauria, yielded to the more prevailing use and reputation of the cavalry; and the <PERSON>Scythian</PERSON> bow was the weapon on which the armies of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were now reduced to place their principal dependence.
 From a laudable desire to assert the dignity of his theme, <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> defends the soldiers of his own time against the morose critics, who confined that respectable name to the heavy-armed warriors of antiquity, and maliciously observed, that the word archer is introduced by <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> (8) as a term of contempt.
 Five hundred transports, navigated by twenty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> mariners of Egypt, Cilicia, and Ionia, were collected in the harbour of Constantinople.
 The smallest of these vessels may be computed at thirty, the largest at <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred, tons; and the fair average will supply an allowance, liberal, but not profuse, of about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> tons, (10) for the reception of thirty-five <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers and sailors, of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horses, of arms, engines, and military stores, and of a sufficient stock of water and provisions for a voyage, perhaps, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months.
 The proud galleys, which in former ages swept the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> with so many hundred oars, had long since disappeared; and the fleet of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was escorted only by <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> light brigantines, covered from the missile weapons of the enemy, and rowed by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the brave and robust youth of Constantinople.
 <CARDINAL>Twenty-two</CARDINAL> generals are named, most of whom were afterwards distinguished in the wars of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Italy: but the supreme command, both by land and sea, was delegated to <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> alone, with a boundless power of acting according to his discretion, as if the emperor himself were present.
 The separation of the naval and military professions is at once the effect and the cause of the modern improvements in the science of navigation and maritime war.
 Departure of the fleet, A.
D.
 533, June.
 In the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> year of the reign of Justinian, and about the time of the <DATE>summer</DATE> solstice, the whole fleet of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred ships was ranged in martial pomp before the gardens of the palace.
 The patriarch pronounced his benediction, the emperor signified his last commands, the general's trumpet gave the signal of departure, and every heart, according to its fears or wishes, explored, with anxious curiosity, the omens of misfortune and success.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> halt was made at <GPE>Perinthus</GPE> or Heraclea, where <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> waited <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> days to receive some <NORP>Thracian</NORP> horses, a military gift of his sovereign.
 From thence the fleet pursued their course through the midst of the Propontis; but as they struggled to pass the <LOC>Straits</LOC> of the Hellespont, an unfavourable wind detained them <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> days at Abydus, where the general exhibited a memorable lesson of firmness and severity.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> of the Huns, who in a drunken quarrel had slain <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their fellow-soldiers, were instantly shown to the army suspended on a lofty gibbet.
 The national dignity was resented by their countrymen, who disclaimed the servile laws of the empire, and asserted the free privilege of Scythia, where a small fine was allowed to expiate the hasty sallies of intemperance and anger.
 Their complaints were specious, their clamours were loud, and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were not averse to the example of disorder and impunity.
 But the rising sedition was appeased by the authority and eloquence of the general: and he represented to the assembled troops the obligation of justice, the importance of discipline, the rewards of piety and virtue, and the unpardonable guilt of murder, which, in his apprehension, was aggravated rather than excused by the vice of intoxication.
 (11) In the navigation from the <PRODUCT>Hellespont</PRODUCT> to Peloponnesus, which the Greeks, after the siege of Troy, had performed in <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> days, (12) the fleet of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was guided in their course by his master-galley, conspicuous in the day by the redness of the sails, and in the night by the torches blazing from the mast head.
 It was the duty of the pilots, as they steered between the islands, and turned the Capes of Malea and Taenarium, to preserve the just order and regular intervals of such a multitude of ships: as the wind was fair and moderate, their labours were not unsuccessful, and the troops were safely disembarked at <GPE>Methone</GPE> on the Messenian coast, to repose themselves for a while after the fatigues of the sea.
 In this place they experienced how avarice, invested with authority, may sport with the lives of <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> which are bravely exposed for the public service.
 According to military practice, the bread or biscuit of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was twice prepared in the oven, and the diminution of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> fourth was cheerfully allowed for the loss of weight.
 To gain this miserable profit, and to save the expense of wood, the praefect <PERSON>John</PERSON> of <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> had given orders that the flour should be slightly baked by the same fire which warmed the baths of Constantinople; and when the sacks were opened, a soft and mouldy paste was distributed to the army.
 Such unwholesome food, assisted by the heat of the climate and season, soon produced an epidemical disease, which swept away <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers.
 Their health was restored by the diligence of Belisarius, who provided fresh bread at Methone, and boldly expressed his just and humane indignation the emperor heard his complaint; the general was praised but the minister was not punished.
 From the port of Methone, the pilots steered along the western coast of Peloponnesus, as far as the Isle of Zacynthus, or Zante, before they undertook the voyage (in their eyes a most arduous voyage) of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred leagues over the Ionian Sea.
 As the fleet was surprised by a calm, <DATE>sixteen</DATE> days were consumed in the slow navigation; and even the general would have suffered the intolerable hardship of thirst, if the ingenuity of <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> had not preserved the water in glass bottles, which she buried deep in the sand in a part of the ship impervious to the rays of the sun.
 At length the harbour of Caucana, (13) on the southern side of Sicily, afforded a secure and hospitable shelter.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> officers who governed the island in the name of the daughter and grandson of Theodoric, obeyed their imprudent orders, to receive the troops of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> like friends and allies: provisions were liberally supplied, the cavalry was remounted, (14) and <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> soon returned from <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> with correct information of the state and designs of the Vandals.
 His intelligence determined <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> to hasten his operations, and his wise impatience was seconded by the winds.
 The fleet lost sight of Sicily, passed before the Isle of Malta, discovered the capes of Africa, ran along the coast with a strong gale from the north-east, and finally cast anchor at the promontory of Caput Vada, about <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> days' journey to the south of Carthage.
 (15) <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> lands on the coast of <LOC>Africa</LOC> - September If <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> had been informed of the approach of the enemy, he must have delayed the conquest of <GPE>Sardinia</GPE> for the immediate defence of his person and kingdom.
 A detachment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and twenty galleys, would have joined the remaining forces of the Vandals; and the descendant of <NORP>Genseric</NORP> might have surprised and oppressed a fleet of deep laden transports, incapable of action, and of light brigantines that seemed only qualified for flight.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> had secretly trembled when he overheard his soldiers, in the passage, emboldening each other to confess their apprehensions: if they were once on shore, they hoped to maintain the honour of their arms; but if they should be attacked at sea, they did not blush to acknowledge that they wanted courage to contend at the same time with the winds, the waves, and the Barbarians.
 (16) The knowledge of their sentiments decided <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> to seize the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> opportunity of landing them on the coast of Africa; and he prudently rejected, in a council of war, the proposal of sailing with the fleet and army into the port of Carthage.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> months after their departure from Constantinople, the men and horses, the arms and military stores, were safely disembarked, and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> soldiers were left as a guard on board each of the ships, which were disposed in the form of a semicircle.
 The remainder of the troops occupied a camp on the sea- shore, which they fortified, according to ancient discipline, with a ditch and rampart; and the discovery of a source of fresh water, while it allayed the thirst, excited the superstitious confidence, of the Romans.
 The next morning, some of the neighbouring gardens were pillaged; and Belisarius, after chastising the offenders, embraced the slight occasion, but the decisive moment, of inculcating the maxims of justice, moderation, and genuine policy.
 These exhortations were enforced by a rigid discipline, of which the soldiers themselves soon felt and praised the salutary effects.
 The inhabitants, instead of deserting their houses, or hiding their corn, supplied the <NORP>Romans</NORP> with a fair and liberal market: the civil officers of the province continued to exercise their functions in the name of Justinian: and the clergy, from motives of conscience and interest, assiduously labored to promote the cause of a <NORP>Catholic</NORP> emperor.
 The small town of Sullecte, (17) <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day's journey from the camp, had the honour of being foremost to open her gates, and to resume her ancient allegiance: the larger cities of <GPE>Leptis</GPE> and <GPE>Adrumetum</GPE> imitated the example of loyalty as soon as <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> appeared; and he advanced without opposition as far as Grasse, a palace of the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> kings, at the distance of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> miles from Carthage.
 The weary <NORP>Romans</NORP> indulged themselves in the refreshment of shady groves, cool fountains, and delicious fruits; and the preference which <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> allows to these gardens over any that he had seen, either in the <LOC>East</LOC> or West, may be ascribed either to the taste, or the fatigue, or the historian.
 In <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> generations, prosperity and a warm climate had dissolved the hardy virtue of the Vandals, who insensibly became the most luxurious of mankind.
 In their villas and gardens, which might deserve the <NORP>Persian</NORP> name of Paradise, (18) they enjoyed a cool and elegant repose; and, after the daily use of the bath, the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were seated at a table profusely spread with the delicacies of the land and sea.
 Their silken robes loosely flowing, after the fashion of the Medes, were embroidered with gold; love and hunting were the labours of their life, and their vacant hours were amused by pantomimes, chariot-races, and the music and dances of the theatre.
 Defeats the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> battle.
 In a march of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> days, the vigilance of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was constantly awake and active against his unseen enemies, by whom, in every place, and at every hour, he might be suddenly attacked.
 An officer of confidence and merit, <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Armenian, led the vanguard of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred horse; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred <PERSON>Massagetae</PERSON> covered at a certain distance the left flank; and the whole fleet, steering along the coast, seldom lost sight of the army, which moved each day about <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, and lodged in the <TIME>evening</TIME> in strong camps, or in friendly towns.
 The near approach of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to <GPE>Carthage</GPE> filled the mind of <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> with anxiety and terror.
 He prudently wished to protract the war till his brother, with his veteran troops, should return from the conquest of Sardinia; and he now lamented the rash policy of his ancestors, who, by destroying the fortifications of Africa, had left him only the dangerous resource of risking a battle in the neighbourhood of his capital.
 The <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> conquerors, from their original number of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand, were multiplied, without including their women and children, to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men: and such forces, animated with valour and union, might have crushed, at their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> landing, the feeble and exhausted bands of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general.
 But the friends of the captive king were more inclined to accept the invitations, than to resist the progress, of Belisarius; and many a proud <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> disguised his aversion to war under the more specious name of his hatred to the usurper.
 Yet the authority and promises of <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> collected a formidable army, and his plans were concerted with some degree of military skill.
 An order was despatched to his brother Ammatas, to collect all the forces of Carthage, and to encounter the van of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army at the distance of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> miles from the city: his nephew Gibamund, with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse, was destined to attack their left, when the monarch himself, who silently followed, should charge their rear, in a situation which excluded them from the aid or even the view of their fleet.
 But the rashness of <PERSON>Ammatas</PERSON> was fatal to himself and his country.
 He anticipated the hour of the attack, outstripped his tardy followers, and was pierced with a mortal wound, after he had slain with his own hand <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> of his boldest antagonists.
 His <NORP>Vandals</NORP> fled to Carthage; the highway, almost <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> miles, was strewed with dead bodies; and it seemed incredible that such multitudes could be slaughtered by the swords of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred Romans.
 The nephew of <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> was defeated, after a slight combat, by the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred Massagetae: they did not equal the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> part of his numbers; but each <PERSON>Scythian</PERSON> was fired by the example of his chief, who gloriously exercised the privilege of his family, by riding, foremost and alone, to shoot the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arrow against the enemy.
 In the mean while, <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> himself, ignorant of the event, and misguided by the windings of the hills, inadvertently passed the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army, and reached the scene of action where <PERSON>Ammatas</PERSON> had fallen.
 He wept the fate of his brother and of Carthage, charged with irresistible fury the advancing squadrons, and might have pursued, and perhaps decided, the victory, if he had not wasted those inestimable moments in the discharge of a vain, though pious, duty to the dead.
 While his spirit was broken by this mournful office, he heard the trumpet of Belisarius, who, leaving <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> and his infantry in the camp, pressed forwards with his guards and the remainder of the cavalry to rally his flying troops, and to restore the fortune of the day.
 Much room could not be found, in this disorderly battle, for the talents of a general; but the king fled before the hero; and the Vandals, accustomed only to a <NORP>Moorish</NORP> enemy, were incapable of withstanding the arms and discipline of the Romans.
 <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> retired with hasty steps towards the desert of Numidia: but he had soon the consolation of learning that his private orders for the execution of <PERSON>Hilderic</PERSON> and his captive friends had been faithfully obeyed.
 The tyrant's revenge was useful only to his enemies.
 The death of a lawful prince excited the compassion of his people; his life might have perplexed the victorious Romans; and the lieutenant of Justinian, by a crime of which he was innocent, was relieved from the painful alternative of forfeiting his honour or relinquishing his conquests.
 Reduction of Carthage, A.
D.
 533, Sept 15.
 As soon as the tumult had subsided, the several parts of the army informed each other of the accidents of the day; and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> pitched his camp on the field of victory, to which the <ORDINAL>tenth</ORDINAL> mile-stone from <GPE>Carthage</GPE> had applied the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> appellation of Decimus.
 From a wise suspicion of the stratagems and resources of the Vandals, he marched the next day in order of battle, halted in the <TIME>evening</TIME> before the gates of Carthage, and allowed a night of repose, that he might not, in darkness and disorder, expose the city to the license of the soldiers, or the soldiers themselves to the secret ambush of the city.
 But as the fears of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> were the result of calm and intrepid reason, he was soon satisfied that he might confide, without danger, in the peaceful and friendly aspect of the capital.
 <GPE>Carthage</GPE> blazed with innumerable torches, the signals of the public joy; the chain was removed that guarded the entrance of the port; the gates were thrown open, and the people, with acclamations of gratitude, hailed and invited their <NORP>Roman</NORP> deliverers.
 The defeat of the Vandals, and the freedom of Africa, were announced to the city on the eve of St.
 Cyprian, when the churches were already adorned and illuminated for the festival of the martyr whom <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> centuries of superstition had almost raised to a local deity.
 The Arians, conscious that their reign had expired, resigned the temple to the Catholics, who rescued their saint from profane hands, performed the holy rites, and loudly proclaimed the creed of <PERSON>Athanasius</PERSON> and Justinian.
 One awful hour reversed the fortunes of the contending parties.
 The suppliant Vandals, who had so lately indulged the vices of conquerors, sought an humble refuge in the sanctuary of the church; while the merchants of the <LOC>East</LOC> were delivered from the deepest dungeon of the palace by their affrighted keeper, who implored the protection of his captives, and showed them, through an aperture in the wall, the sails of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> fleet.
 After their separation from the army, the naval commanders had proceeded with slow caution along the coast till they reached the Hermaean promontory, and obtained the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> intelligence of the victory of Belisarius.
 Faithful to his instructions, they would have cast anchor about twenty miles from Carthage, if the more skilful seamen had not represented the perils of the shore, and the signs of an impending tempest.
 Still ignorant of the revolution, they declined, however, the rash attempt of forcing the chain of the port; and the adjacent harbour and suburb of <GPE>Mandracium</GPE> were insulted only by the rapine of a private officer, who disobeyed and deserted his leaders.
 But the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> fleet, advancing with a fair wind, steered through the narrow entrance of the Goletta, and occupied, in the deep and capacious lake of Tunis, a secure station about <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> miles from the capital.
 (19) No sooner was <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> informed of their arrival, than he despatched orders that the greatest part of the mariners should be immediately landed to join the triumph, and to swell the apparent numbers, of the Romans.
 Before he allowed them to enter the gates of Carthage, he exhorted them, in a discourse worthy of himself and the occasion, not to disgrace the glory of their arms; and to remember that the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> had been the tyrants, but that they were the deliverers, of the Africans, who must now be respected as the voluntary and affectionate subjects of their common sovereign.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> marched through the streets in close ranks prepared for battle if an enemy had appeared: the strict order maintained by the general imprinted on their minds the duty of obedience; and in an age in which custom and impunity almost sanctified the abuse of conquest, the genius of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> man repressed the passions of a victorious army.
 The voice of menace and complaint was silent; the trade of <GPE>Carthage</GPE> was not interrupted; while <LOC>Africa</LOC> changed her master and her government, the shops continued open and busy; and the soldiers, after sufficient guards had been posted, modestly departed to the houses which were allotted for their reception.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> fixed his residence in the palace; seated himself on the throne of Genseric; accepted and distributed the <NORP>Barbaric</NORP> spoil; granted their lives to the suppliant Vandals; and labored to repair the damage which the suburb of <GPE>Mandracium</GPE> had sustained in the preceding night.
 At supper he entertained his principal officers with the form and magnificence of a royal banquet.
 (20) The victor was respectfully served by the captive officers of the household; and in the moments of festivity, when the impartial spectators applauded the fortune and merit of Belisarius, his envious flatterers secretly shed their venom on every word and gesture which might alarm the suspicions of a jealous monarch.
 One day was given to these pompous scenes, which may not be despised as useless, if they attracted the popular veneration; but the active mind of Belisarius, which in the pride of victory could suppose a defeat, had already resolved that the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire in <LOC>Africa</LOC> should not depend on the chance of arms, or the favour of the people.
 The fortifications of <GPE>Carthage</GPE> had alone been exempted from the general proscription; but in the reign of ninety-five years they were suffered to decay by the thoughtless and indolent Vandals.
 A wiser conqueror restored, with incredible despatch, the walls and ditches of the city.
 His liberality encouraged the workmen; the soldiers, the mariners, and the citizens, vied with each other in the salutary labor; and Gelimer, who had feared to trust his person in an open town, beheld with astonishment and despair, the rising strength of an impregnable fortress.
 Final defeat of <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> and the Vandals, A.
D.
 533, November.
 That unfortunate monarch, after the loss of his capital, applied himself to collect the remains of an army scattered, rather than destroyed, by the preceding battle; and the hopes of pillage attracted some <NORP>Moorish</NORP> bands to the standard of Gelimer.
 He encamped in the fields of Bulla, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> days' journey from Carthage; insulted the capital, which he deprived of the use of an aqueduct; proposed a high reward for the head of every Roman; affected to spare the persons and property of his <NORP>African</NORP> subjects, and secretly negotiated with the <NORP>Arian</NORP> sectaries and the confederate Huns.
 Under these circumstances, the conquest of <GPE>Sardinia</GPE> served only to aggravate his distress: he reflected, with the deepest anguish, that he had wasted, in that useless enterprise, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of his bravest troops; and he read, with grief and shame, the victorious letters of his brother Zano, who expressed a sanguine confidence that the king, after the example of their ancestors, had already chastised the rashness of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> invader.
 On the receipt of this epistle, <PERSON>Zano</PERSON> imparted his grief to the principal Vandals; but the intelligence was prudently concealed from the natives of the island.
 The troops embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and twenty galleys at the port of Caghari, cast anchor the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day on the confines of Mauritania, and hastily pursued their march to join the royal standard in the camp of Bulla.
 <PERSON>Mournful</PERSON> was the interview: the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers embraced; they wept in silence; no questions were asked of the <NORP>Sardinian</NORP> victory; no inquiries were made of the <NORP>African</NORP> misfortunes: they saw before their eyes the whole extent of their calamities; and the absence of their wives and children afforded a melancholy proof that either death or captivity had been their lot.
 The languid spirit of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> was at length awakened and united by the entreaties of their king, the example of Zano, and the instant danger which threatened their monarchy and religion.
 The military strength of the nation advanced to battle; and such was the rapid increase, that before their army reached Tricameron, about twenty miles from Carthage, they might boast, perhaps with some exaggeration, that they surpassed, in a tenfold proportion, the diminutive powers of the Romans.
 But these powers were under the command of Belisarius; and, as he was conscious of their superior merit, he permitted the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> to surprise him at an unseasonable hour.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> were instantly under arms; a rivulet covered their front; the cavalry formed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> line, which <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> supported in the centre, at the head of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred guards; the infantry, at some distance, was posted in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line; and the vigilance of the general watched the separate station and ambiguous faith of the Massagetae, who secretly reserved their aid for the conquerors.
 The historian has inserted, and the reader may easily supply, the speeches (21) of the commanders, who, by arguments the most apposite to their situation, inculcated the importance of victory, and the contempt of life.
 Zano, with the troops which had followed him to the conquest of Sardinia, was placed in the centre; and the throne of <NORP>Genseric</NORP> might have stood, if the multitude of <NORP>Vandals</NORP> had imitated their intrepid resolution.
 Casting away their lances and missile weapons, they drew their swords, and expected the charge: the <NORP>Roman</NORP> cavalry thrice passed the rivulet; they were thrice repulsed; and the conflict was firmly maintained, till <PERSON>Zano</PERSON> fell, and the standard of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was displayed.
 <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> retreated to his camp; the <PERSON>Huns</PERSON> joined the pursuit; and the victors despoiled the bodies of the slain.
 Yet no more than <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> Romans, and eight hundred <NORP>Vandals</NORP> were found on the field of battle; so inconsiderable was the carnage of a day, which extinguished a nation, and transferred the empire of Africa.
 In the <TIME>evening</TIME> <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> led his infantry to the attack of the camp; and the pusillanimous flight of <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> exposed the vanity of his recent declarations, that to the vanquished, death was a relief, life a burden, and infamy the only object of terror.
 His departure was secret; but as soon as the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> discovered that their king had deserted them, they hastily dispersed, anxious only for their personal safety, and careless of every object that is dear or valuable to mankind.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> entered the camp without resistance; and the wildest scenes of disorder were veiled in the darkness and confusion of the night.
 Every <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> who met their swords was inhumanly massacred; their widows and daughters, as rich heirs, or beautiful concubines, were embraced by the licentious soldiers; and avarice itself was almost satiated with the treasures of gold and silver, the accumulated fruits of conquest or economy in a long period of prosperity and peace.
 In this frantic search, the troops, even of Belisarius, forgot their caution and respect.
 Intoxicated with lust and rapine, they explored, in small parties, or alone, the adjacent fields, the woods, the rocks, and the caverns, that might possibly conceal any desirable prize: laden with booty, they deserted their ranks, and wandered without a guide, on the high road to Carthage; and if the flying enemies had dared to return, very few of the conquerors would have escaped.
 Deeply sensible of the disgrace and danger, <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> passed an apprehensive night on the field of victory: at the dawn of day, he planted his standard on a hill, recalled his guardians and veterans, and gradually restored the modesty and obedience of the camp.
 It was equally the concern of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general to subdue the hostile, and to save the prostrate, Barbarian; and the suppliant Vandals, who could be found only in churches, were protected by his authority, disarmed, and separately confined, that they might neither disturb the public peace, nor become the victims of popular revenge.
 After despatching a light detachment to tread the footsteps of Gelimer, he advanced, with his whole army, about <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' march, as far as Hippo Regius, which no longer possessed the relics of St.
 Augustin.
 (22) The season, and the certain intelligence that the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> had fled to an inaccessible country of the Moors, determined <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> to relinquish the vain pursuit, and to fix his <DATE>winter</DATE> quarters at Carthage.
 From thence he despatched his principal lieutenant, to inform the emperor, that in the space of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months he had achieved the conquest of Africa.
 Conquest of <LOC>Africa</LOC> by Belisarius, A.
D.
 534.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> spoke the language of truth.
 The surviving <NORP>Vandals</NORP> yielded, without resistance, their arms and their freedom; the neighbourhood of <GPE>Carthage</GPE> submitted to his presence; and the more distant provinces were successively subdued by the report of his victory.
 <GPE>Tripoli</GPE> was confirmed in her voluntary allegiance; <GPE>Sardinia</GPE> and <GPE>Corsica</GPE> surrendered to an officer, who carried, instead of a sword, the head of the valiant Zano; and the Isles of Majorca, Minorca, and <ORG>Yvica</ORG> consented to remain an humble appendage of the <NORP>African</NORP> kingdom.
 Caesarea, a royal city, which in looser geography may be confounded with the modern Algiers, was situate <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> days' march to the westward of Carthage: by land, the road was infested by the Moors; but the sea was open, and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were now masters of the sea.
 An active and discreet tribune sailed as far as the Straits, where he occupied <LOC>Septem</LOC> or Ceuta, (23) which rises opposite to <GPE>Gibraltar</GPE> on the <NORP>African</NORP> coast; that remote place was afterwards adorned and fortified by Justinian; and he seems to have indulged the vain ambition of extending his empire to the columns of Hercules.
 He received the messengers of victory at the time when he was preparing to publish the <WORK_OF_ART>Pandects</WORK_OF_ART> of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> laws; and the devout or jealous emperor celebrated the divine goodness, and confessed, in silence, the merit of his successful general.
 (24) Impatient to abolish the temporal and spiritual tyranny of the Vandals, he proceeded, without delay, to the full establishment of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 Her jurisdiction, wealth, and immunites, perhaps the most essential part of episcopal religion, were restored and amplified with a liberal hand; the <NORP>Arian</NORP> worship was suppressed; the <NORP>Donatist</NORP> meetings were proscribed; (25) and the synod of Carthage, by the voice of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and seventeen bishops, (26) applauded the just measure of pious retaliation.
 On such an occasion, it may not be presumed, that many orthodox prelates were absent; but the comparative smallness of their number, which in ancient councils had been twice or even thrice multiplied, most clearly indicates the decay both of the church and state.
 While <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> approved himself the defender of the faith, he entertained an ambitious hope, that his victorious lieutenant would speedily enlarge the narrow limits of his dominion to the space which they occupied before the invasion of the <NORP>Moors</NORP> and Vandals; and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was instructed to establish <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> dukes or commanders in the convenient stations of Tripoli, Leptis, Cirta, Caesarea, and Sardinia, and to compute the military force of palatines or borderers that might be sufficient for the defence of Africa.
 The kingdom of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> was not unworthy of the presence of a <PERSON>Praetorian</PERSON> praefect; and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> consulars, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> presidents, were appointed to administer the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces under his civil jurisdiction.
 The number of their subordinate officers, clerks, messengers, or assistants, was minutely expressed; <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred and ninety-six for the praefect himself, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> for each of his vicegerents; and the rigid definition of their fees and salaries was more effectual to confirm the right than to prevent the abuse.
 These magistrates might be oppressive, but they were not idle; and the subtile questions of justice and revenue were infinitely propagated under the new government, which professed to revive the freedom and equity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic.
 The conqueror was solicitous to extract a prompt and plentiful supply from his <NORP>African</NORP> subjects; and he allowed them to claim, even in the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> degree, and from the collateral line, the houses and lands of which their families had been unjustly despoiled by the Vandals.
 After the departure of Belisarius, who acted by a high and special commission, no ordinary provision was made for a master- general of the forces; but the office of <PERSON>Praetorian</PERSON> praefect was entrusted to a soldier; the civil and military powers were united, according to the practice of Justinian, in the chief governor; and the representative of the emperor in Africa, as well as in Italy, was soon distinguished by the appellation of Exarch.
 (27) Distress and captivity of Gelimer, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>534</CARDINAL> - the Spring.
 Yet the conquest of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was imperfect till her former sovereign was delivered, either alive or dead, into the hands of the Romans.
 Doubtful of the event, <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> had given secret orders that a part of his treasure should be transported to Spain, where he hoped to find a secure refuge at the court of the king of the Visigoths.
 But these intentions were disappointed by accident, treachery, and the indefatigable pursuit of his enemies, who intercepted his flight from the sea-shore, and chased the unfortunate monarch, with some faithful followers, to the inaccessible mountain of Papua, (28) in the inland country of Numidia.
 He was immediately besieged by Pharas, an officer whose truth and sobriety were the more applauded, as such qualities could seldom be found among the Heruli, the most corrupt of the <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> tribes.
 To his vigilance <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> had entrusted this important charge and, after a bold attempt to scale the mountain, in which he lost a hundred and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> soldiers, <PERSON>Pharas</PERSON> expected, during a <DATE>winter</DATE> siege, the operation of distress and famine on the mind of the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> king.
 From the softest habits of pleasure, from the unbounded command of industry and wealth, he was reduced to share the poverty of the Moors, (29) supportable only to themselves by their ignorance of a happier condition.
 In their rude hovels, of mud and hurdles, which confined the smoke and excluded the light, they promiscuously slept on the ground, perhaps on a sheep-skin, with their wives, their children, and their cattle.
 Sordid and scanty were their garments; the use of bread and wine was unknown; and their oaten or barley cakes, imperfectly baked in the ashes, were devoured almost in a crude state, by the hungry savages.
 The health of <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> must have sunk under these strange and unwonted hardships, from whatsoever cause they had been endured; but his actual misery was embittered by the recollection of past greatness, the daily insolence of his protectors, and the just apprehension, that the light and venal <NORP>Moors</NORP> might be tempted to betray the rights of hospitality.
 The knowledge of his situation dictated the humane and friendly epistle of Pharas.
 From the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> messenger, <PERSON>Pharas</PERSON> was informed of the motives of this singular request.
 It was long since the king of <LOC>Africa</LOC> had tasted bread; a defluxion had fallen on his eyes, the effect of fatigue or incessant weeping; and he wished to solace the melancholy hours, by singing to the lyre the sad story of his own misfortunes.
 The humanity of <PERSON>Pharas</PERSON> was moved; he sent the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> extraordinary gifts; but even his humanity prompted him to redouble the vigilance of his guard, that he might sooner compel his prisoner to embrace a resolution advantageous to the Romans, but salutary to himself.
 The obstinacy of <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> at length yielded to reason and necessity; the solemn assurances of safety and honourable treatment were ratified in the emperor's name, by the ambassador of Belisarius; and the king of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> descended from the mountain.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> public interview was in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Carthage; and when the royal captive accosted his conqueror, he burst into a fit of laughter.
 The crowd might naturally believe, that extreme grief had deprived <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> of his senses: but in this mournful state, unseasonable mirth insinuated to more intelligent observers, that the vain and transitory scenes of human greatness are unworthy of a serious thought.
 (31) Return and triumph of Belisarius, A.
D.
 534.
 <DATE>Autumn</DATE> .
 Their contempt was soon justified by a new example of a vulgar truth; that flattery adheres to power, and envy to superior merit.
 The chiefs of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army presumed to think themselves the rivals of a hero.
 Their private despatches maliciously affirmed, that the conqueror of Africa, strong in his reputation and the public love, conspired to seat himself on the throne of the Vandals.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> listened with too patient an ear; and his silence was the result of jealousy rather than of confidence.
 An honourable alternative, of remaining in the province, or of returning to the capital, was indeed submitted to the discretion of Belisarius; but he wisely concluded, from intercepted letters and the knowledge of his sovereign's temper, that he must either resign his head, erect his standard, or confound his enemies by his presence and submission.
 Innocence and courage decided his choice; his guards, captives, and treasures, were diligently embarked; and so prosperous was the navigation, that his arrival at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> preceded any certain account of his departure from the port of Carthage.
 Such unsuspecting loyalty removed the apprehensions of Justinian; envy was silenced and inflamed by the public gratitude; and the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Africanus</PERSON> obtained the honours of a triumph, a ceremony which the city of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had never seen, and which ancient Rome, since the reign of Tiberius, had reserved for the auspicious arms of the Caesars.
 (32) From the palace of Belisarius, the procession was conducted through the principal streets to the hippodrome; and this memorable day seemed to avenge the injuries of Genseric, and to expiate the shame of the Romans.
 The wealth of nations was displayed, the trophies of martial or effeminate luxury; rich armour, golden thrones, and the chariots of state which had been used by the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> queen; the massy furniture of the royal banquet, the splendour of precious stones, the elegant forms of statues and vases, the more substantial treasure of gold, and the holy vessels of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> temple, which after their long peregrination were respectfully deposited in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> church of Jerusalem.
 A long train of the noblest <NORP>Vandals</NORP> reluctantly exposed their lofty stature and manly countenance.
 <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> slowly advanced: he was clad in a purple robe, and still maintained the majesty of a king.
 Not a tear escaped from his eyes, not a sigh was heard; but his pride or piety derived some secret consolation from the words of Solomon, (33) which he repeatedly pronounced, VANITY! VANITY! ALL IS VANITY! Instead of ascending a triumphal car drawn by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> horses or elephants, the modest conqueror marched on foot at the head of his brave companions; his prudence might decline an honour too conspicuous for a subject; and his magnanimity might justly disdain what had been so often sullied by the vilest of tyrants.
 The glorious procession entered the gate of the hippodrome; was saluted by the acclamations of the senate and people; and halted before the throne where <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> were seated to receive homage of the captive monarch and the victorious hero.
 They both performed the customary adoration; and falling prostrate on the ground, respectfully touched the footstool of a prince who had not unsheathed his sword, and of a prostitute who had danced on the theatre; some gentle violence was used to bend the stubborn spirit of the grandson of Genseric; and however trained to servitude, the genius of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> must have secretly rebelled.
 His sole consulship, A.
D.
 535, January 1.
 He was immediately declared consul for the ensuing year, and the day of his inauguration resembled the pomp of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> triumph: his curule chair was borne aloft on the shoulders of captive Vandals; and the spoils of war, gold cups, and rich girdles, were profusely scattered among the populace.
 End of <PERSON>Gelimer</PERSON> and the Vandals.
 But the purest reward of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was in the faithful execution of a treaty for which his honour had been pledged to the king of the Vandals.
 The religious scruples of Gelimer, who adhered to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy, were incompatible with the dignity of senator or patrician: but he received from the emperor an ample estate in the province of Galatia, where the abdicated monarch retired, with his family and friends, to a life of peace, of affluence, and perhaps of content.
 (34) The daughters of <PERSON>Hilderic</PERSON> were entertained with the respectful tenderness due to their age and misfortune; and <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> accepted the honour of educating and enriching the female descendants of the great Theodosius.
 The bravest of the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> youth were distributed into <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> squadrons of cavalry, which adopted the name of their benefactor, and supported in the <NORP>Persian</NORP> wars the glory of their ancestors.
 But these rare exceptions, the reward of birth or valour, are insufficient to explain the fate of a nation whose numbers, before a short and bloodless war amounted to more than <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> persons.
 After the exile of their king and nobles, the servile crowd might purchase their safety by adjuring their character, religion, and language; and their degenerate posterity would be insensibly mingled with the common herd of <NORP>African</NORP> subjects.
 Yet even in the present age, and in the heart of the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> tribes, a curious traveller has discovered the white complexion and long flaxen hair of a northern race;(35) and it was formerly believed that the boldest of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> fled beyond the power, or even the knowledge, of the Romans, to enjoy their solitary freedom on the shores of the <LOC>Atlantic</LOC> ocean.
(36) <LOC>Africa</LOC> had been their empire, it became their prison; nor could they entertain a hope, or even a wish, of returning to the banks of the Elbe, where their brethren, of a spirit less adventurous, still wandered in their native forests.
 It was impossible for cowards te surmount the barriers of unknown seas and hostile barbarians - it was impossible for brave men to expose their nakedness and defeat before the eyes of their countrymen, to describe the kingdoms which they had lost, and to claim a share of the humble inheritance which, in a happier hour, they had almost unanimously renounced.
(37) In the country between the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and the <LOC>Oder</LOC> several populous villages of <GPE>Lusatia</GPE> are inhabited by the Vandals: they still preserve their language, their customs, and the purity of their blood; support, with some impatience, the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> or <NORP>Prussian</NORP> yoke; and serve, with secret and voluntary allegiance, the descendant of their ancient kings, who in his garb and present fortune is confounded with the meanest of his vassals.
(38) The name and situation of this unhappy people might indicate their descent from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> common stock with the conquerors of Africa.
 But the use of a <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> dialect more clearly represents them as the last remnant of the new colonies who succeeded to the genuine Vandals, already scattered or destroyed in the age of Procopius.
 (39) Manners and defeat of the Moors, A.
D.
 535.
 If <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> had been tempted to hesitate in his allegiance, he might have urged, even against the emperor himself, the indispensable duty of saving <LOC>Africa</LOC> from an enemy more barbarous than the Vandals.
 The origin of the <NORP>Moors</NORP> is involved in darkness: they were ignorant of the use of letters.
(40) Their limits cannot be precisely defined; a boundless continent was open to the <NORP>Libyan</NORP> shepherds; the change of seasons and pastures regulated their motions; and their rude huts and slender furniture were transported with the same ease as their arms, their families, and their cattle, which consisted of sheep, oxen, and camels.
(41) During the vigour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> power they observed a respectful distance from <GPE>Carthage</GPE> and the sea-shore; under the feeble reign of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> they invaded the cities of Numidia, occupied the sea-coast from <GPE>Tangier</GPE> to Caesarea, and pitched their camps, with impunity, in the fertile province of Pyzacium.
 The formidable strength and artful conduct of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> secured the neutrality of the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> princes, whose vanity aspired to receive in the emperor's name the ensigns of their regal dignity.
(42) They were astonished by the rapid event, and trembled in the presence of their conqueror.
 But his approaching departure soon relieved the apprehensions of a savage and superstitious people; the number of their wives allowed them to disregard the safety of their infant hostages; and when the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general hoisted sail in the port of Carthage, he heard the cries and almost beheld the flames of the desolated province.
 Yet he persisted in his resolution; and leaving only a part of his guards to reinforce the feeble garrisons, he entrusted the command of <LOC>Africa</LOC> to the eunuch Solomon,(43) who proved himself not unworthy to be the successor of Belisarius.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invasion some detachments, with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> officers of merit, were surprised and intercepted; but <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON> speedily assembled his troops, marched from <GPE>Carthage</GPE> into the heart of the country, and in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great battles destroyed sixty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the barbarians.
 The <NORP>Moors</NORP> depended on their multitude, their swiftness, and their inaccessible mountains, and the aspect and smell of their camels are said to have produced some confusion in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> cavalry.
(44) But as soon as they were commanded to dismount, they derided this contemptible obstacle: as soon as the columns ascended the hills, the naked and disorderly crowd was dazzled by glittering arms and regular evolutions - and the menace of their female prophets was repeatedly fulfilled, that the <NORP>Moors</NORP> should be discomfited by a beardless antagonist.
 The victorious eunuch advanced <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> days' journey from <GPE>Carthage</GPE> to besiege Mount Aurasius,(45) the citadel, and at the same time the gar den, of Numidia.
 That range of hills, a branch of the great Atlas, contains, within a circumference of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and twenty miles, a rare variety of soil and climate; the intermediate valleys and elevated plains abound with rich pastures, perpetual streams, and fruits of a delicious taste and uncommon magnitude.
 This fair solitude is decorated with the ruins of Lambesa, a <NORP>Roman</NORP> city, once the seat of a legion, and the residence of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> inhabitants.
 The Ionic temple of <GPE>Aesculapius</GPE> is encompassed with <NORP>Moorish</NORP> huts; and the cattle now graze in the midst of an amphitheatre, under the shade of <NORP>Corinthian</NORP> columns.
 A sharp perpendicular rock rises above the level of the mountain, where the <NORP>African</NORP> princes deposited their wives and treasure; and a proverb is familiar to the Arabs, that the man may eat fire who dares to attack the craggy cliffs and inhospitable natives of Mount Aurasius.
 This hardy enterprise was twice attempted by the eunuch Solomon: from the first, he retreated with some disgrace; and in the second, his patience and provisions were almost exhausted; and he must again have retired, if he had not yielded to the impetuous courage of his troops, who audaciously scaled, to the astonishment of the Moors, the mountain, the hostile camp, and the summit of the <NORP>Geminian</NORP> rock.
 A citadel was erected to secure this important conquest, and to remind the barbarians of their defeat; and as <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON> pursued his march to the west, the long-lost province of Mauritanian Sitifi was again annexed to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The <NORP>Moorish</NORP> war continued several years after the departure of Belisarius; but the laurels which he resigned to a faithful lieutenant may be justly ascribed to his own triumph.
 Neutrality of the Visigoths.
 The experience of past faults, which may sometimes correct the mature age of an individual, is seldom profitable to the successive generations of mankind.
 The nations of antiquity, careless of each other's safety, were separately vanquished and enslaved by the Romans.
 This awful lesson might have instructed the barbarians of the <LOC>West</LOC> to oppose, with timely counsels and confederate arms, the unbounded ambition of Justinian.
 Yet the same error was repeated, the same consequences were felt, and the Goths, both of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Spain, insensible of their approaching danger, beheld with indifference, and even with joy, the rapid downfall of the Vandals.
 After the failure of the royal line, Theudes, a valiant and powerful chief, ascended the throne of <GPE>Spain</GPE> which he had formerly administered in the name of <NORP>Theodoric</NORP> and his infant grandson.
 Under his command the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> besieged the fortress of Ceuta, on the <NORP>African</NORP> coast; but, while they spent the Sabbath-day in peace and devotion, the pious security of their camp was invaded by a sally from the town, and the king himself, with some difficulty and danger, escaped from the hands of a sacrilegious enemy.
(46) It was not long before his pride and resentment were gratified by a suppliant embassy from the unfortunate Gelimer, who implored, in his distress, the aid of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> monarch.
 But instead of sacrificing these unworthy passions to the dictates of generosity and prudence, <PERSON>Theudes</PERSON> amused the ambassadors till he was secretly informed of the loss of Carthage, and then dismissed them, with obscure and contemptuous advice, to seek in their native country a true knowledge of the state of the Vandals.
(47) Conquests of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> in Spain, A.
D.
 550-620.
 The long continuance of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> war delayed the punishment of the Visigoths, and the eyes of <PERSON>Theudes</PERSON> were closed before they tasted the fruits of his mistaken policy.
 After his death the sceptre of <GPE>Spain</GPE> was disputed by a civil war.
 The weaker candidate solicited the protection of Justinian, and ambitiously subscribed a treaty of alliance which deeply wounded the independence and happiness of his country.
 Several cities, both on the ocean and the Mediterranean, were ceded to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops, who afterwards refused to evacuate those pledges, as it should seem, either of safety or payment; and as they were fortified by perpetual supplies from Africa, they maintained their impregnable stations for the mischievous purpose of inflaming the civil and religious factions of the barbarians.
 Seventy years elapsed before this painful thorn could be extirpated from the bosom of the monarchy; and as long as the emperors retained any share of these remote and useless possessions, their vanity might number <GPE>Spain</GPE> in the list of their provinces, and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in the rank of their vassals.

 534.
 The error of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> who reigned in <GPE>Italy</GPE> was less excusable than that of their <NORP>Spanish</NORP> brethren, and their punishment was still more immediate and terrible.
 From a motive of private revenge, they enabled their most dangerous enemy to destroy their most valuable ally.
 A sister of the great <NORP>Theodoric</NORP> had been given in marriage to <PERSON>Thrasimond</PERSON> the <NORP>African</NORP> king: (49) on this occasion the fortress of Lilybaeum,(50) in Sicily, was resigned to the Vandals, and the princess <GPE>Amalafrida</GPE> was attended by a martial train of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> nobles and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers, who signalised their valour in the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> wars.
 Their merit was over-rated by themselves, and perhaps neglected by the Vandals: they viewed the country with envy, and the conquerors with disdain; but their real or fictitious conspiracy was prevented by a massacre; the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were oppressed, and the captivity of <GPE>Amalafrida</GPE> was soon followed by her secret and suspicious death.
 The eloquent pen of <PERSON>Cassiodorus</PERSON> was employed to reproach the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> court with the cruel violation of every social and public duty; but the vengeance which he threatened in the name of his sovereign might be derided with impunity as long as <LOC>Africa</LOC> was protected by the sea, and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were destitute of a navy.
 In the blind impotence of grief and indignation they joyfully saluted the approach of the Romans, entertained the fleet of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> in the ports of Sicily, and were speedily delighted or alarmed by the surprising intelligence that their revenge was executed beyond the measure of their hopes, or perhaps of their wishes.
 To their friendship the emperor was indebted for the kingdom of Africa, and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> might reasonably think that they were entitled to resume the possession of a barren rock, so recently separated as a nuptial gift from the island of Sicily.
 They were soon undeceived by the haughty mandate of Belisarius, which excited their tardy and unavailing repentance.
 A nation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers might have smiled at the vain menace of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and his lieutenant but a spirit of discord and disaffection prevailed in Italy, and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> supported with reluctance the indignity of a female reign.
(51) Government and death of Amalasontha, queen of Italy, A.
D.
 522-534.
 The birth of Amalasontha, the regent and queen of Italy,(52) united the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most illustrious families of the barbarians.
 Her mother, the sister of Clovis, was descended from the long-haired kings of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> race,(53) and the regal succession of the <PERSON>Amali</PERSON> was illustrated in the <ORDINAL>eleventh</ORDINAL> generation by her father, the great Theodoric, whose merit might have ennobled a plebeian origin.
 The sex of his daughter excluded her from the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne; but his vigilant tenderness for his family and his people discovered the last heir of the royal line, whose ancestors had taken refuge in Spain, and the fortunate <PERSON>Eutharic</PERSON> was suddenIy exalted to the rank of a consul and a prince.
 He enjoyed only a short time the charms of <PERSON>Amalasontha</PERSON> and the hopes of the succes sion; and his widow, after the death of her husband and father, was left the guardian of her son <PERSON>Athalaric</PERSON> and the kingdom of Italy.
 At the age of about twenty-eight years, the endowments of her mind and person had attained their perfect maturity.
 Her beauty, which, in the apprehension of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> herself, might have disputed the conquest of an emperor, was animated by manly sense, activity, and resolution.
 Education and experience had cultivated her talents; her philosophic studies were exempt from vanity; and, though she expressed herself with equal elegance and ease in the Greek, the Latin, and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> tongues, the daughter of <NORP>Theodoric</NORP> maintained in her counsels a discreet and impenetrable silence.
 By a faithful imitation of the virtues, she revived the prosperity of his reign; while she strove, with pious care, to expiate the faults and to obliterate the darker memory of his declining age.
 The children of <PERSON>Boethius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Symmachus</PERSON> were restored to their paternal inheritance; her extreme lenity never consented to inflict any corporal or pecuniary penalties on her <NORP>Roman</NORP> subjects; and she generously despised the clamours of the Goths, who, at the end of forty years, still considered the people of <GPE>Italy</GPE> as their slaves or their enemies.
 Her salutary measures were directed by the wisdom and celebrated by the eloquence of Cassiodorus; she solicited and deserved the friendship of the emperor; and the kingdoms of <LOC>Europe</LOC> respected, both in peace and war, the majesty of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 But the future happiness of the queen of <GPE>Italy</GPE> depended on the education of her son, who was destined, by his birth, to support the different and almost incompatible characters of the chief of a barbarian camp and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate of a civilised nation.
 From the age of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years (54) <PERSON>Athalaric</PERSON> was diligently instructed in the arts and sciences either useful or ornamental for a <NORP>Roman</NORP> prince, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> venerable <NORP>Goths</NORP> were chosen to instil the principles of honour and virtue into the mind of their young king.
 But the pupil who is insensible of the benefits must abhor the restraints of education; and the solicitude of the queen, which affection rendered anxious and severe, offended the untractable nature of her son and his subjects.
 On a solemn festival, when the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were assembled in the palace of Ravenna, the royal youth escaped from his mother's apartment, and, with tears of pride and anger, complained of a blow which his stubborn disobedience had provoked her to inflict.
 The barbarians resented the indignity which had been offered to their king, accused the regent of conspiring against his life and crown, and imperiously demanded that the grandson of <NORP>Theodoric</NORP> should be rescued from the dastardly discipline of women and pedants, and educated, like a valiant Goth, in the socicty of his equals and the glorious ignorance of his ancestors.
 To this rude clamour, importunately urged as the voice of the nation, <PERSON>Amalasontha</PERSON> was compelled to yield her reason and the dearest wishes of her heart.
 The king of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was abandoned to wine, to women, and to rustic sports; and the indiscreet contempt of the ungrateful youth betrayed the mischievous designs of his favourites and her enemies.
 Encompassed with domestic foes, she entered into a secret negotiation with the emperor Justinian, obtained the assurance of a friendly reception, and had actually deposited at Dyrrachium, in Epirus, a treasure of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold.
 Happy would it have been for her fame and safety if she had calmly retired from barbarous faction to the peace and splendour of Constantinople.
 But the mind of <PERSON>Amalasontha</PERSON> was inflamed by ambition and revenge; and while her ships lay at anchor in the port, she waited for the success of a crime which her passions excused or applauded as an act of justice.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> of the most dangerous malcontents had been separately removed, under the pretence of trust and command, to the frontiers of Italy: they were assassinated by her private emissaries; and the blood of these noble <NORP>Goths</NORP> rendered the queen-mother absolute in the court of Ravenna, and justly odious to a free people.
 But if she had lamented the disorders of her son, she soon wept his irreparable loss; and the death of Athalaric, who, at the age of sixteen, was consumed by premature intemperance, left her destitute of any firm support or legal authority.
 Instead of submitting to the laws of her country, which held as a fundamental maxim that the succession could never pass from the lance to the distaff, the daughter of <NORP>Theodoric</NORP> conceived the impracticable design of sharing, with <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of her cousins, the regal title, and of reserving in her own hands the substance of supreme power.
 He received the proposal with profound respect and affected gratitude; and the eloquent <PERSON>Cassiodorus</PERSON> announced to the senate and the emperor that <PERSON>Amalasontha</PERSON> and <PERSON>Theodatus</PERSON> had ascended the throne of Italy.
 His birth (for his mother was the sister of Theodoric) might be considered as an imperfect title; and the choice of <PERSON>Amalasontha</PERSON> was more strongly directed by her contempt of his avarice and pusillanimity, which had deprived him of the love of the <NORP>Italians</NORP> and the esteem of the barbarians.
 But <PERSON>Theodatus</PERSON> was exasperated by the contempt which he deserved: her justice had repressed and reproached the oppression which he exercised against his <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> neighbours; and the principal Goths, united by common guilt and resentment, conspired to instigate his slow and timid disposition.
 Her exile and death, A.
D.
 535, April 30.
 The letters of congratulation were scarcely dispatched before the queen of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was imprisoned in a small island of the lake of Bolsena,(55) where, after a short confinement, she was strangled in the bath, by the order or with the connivance of the new king, who instructed his turbulent subjects to shed the blood of their sovereigns.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> invades and subdues Siciliy, A.
D.
 535, Dec.
 31.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> beheld with joy the dissensions of the Goths, and the mediation of an ally concealed and promoted the ambitious views of the conqueror.
 His ambassadors, in their public audience, demanded the fortress of Lilybaeum, <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> barbarian fugitives, and a just compensation for the pillage of a small town on the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> borders; but they secretly negotiated with <PERSON>Theodatus</PERSON> to betray the province of Tuscany, and tempted <PERSON>Amalasontha</PERSON> to extricate herself from danger and perplexity by a free surrender of the kingdom of Italy.
 A false and servile epistle was subscribed by the reluctant hand of the captive queen; but the confession of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators who were sent to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> revealed the truth of her deplorable situation, and Justinian, by the voice of a new ambassador, most powerfully interceded for her life and liberty.
 Yet the secret instructions of the same minister were adapted to serve the cruel jealousy of Theodora, who dreaded the presence and superior charms of a rival: he prompted, with artful and ambiguous hints, the execution of a crime so useful to the Romans,(56) received the intelligence of her death with grief and indignation, and denounced, in his master's name, immortal war against the perfidious assassin.
 In Italy, as well as in Africa, the guilt of a usurper appeared to justify the arms of Justinian; but the forces which he prepared were insufficient for the subversion of a mighty kingdom, if their feeble numbers had not been multiplied by the name, the spirit, and the conduct of a hero.
 A chosen troop of guards, who served on horseback and were armed with lances and bucklers, attended the person of Belisarius; his cavalry was composed of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred Huns, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred Moors, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> confederates, and the infantry consisted only of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Isaurians.
 Steering the same course as in his former expedition, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul cast anchor before Catana, in Sicily, to survey the strength of the island, and to decide whether he should attempt the conquest or peaceably pursue his voyage for the <NORP>African</NORP> coast.
 He found a fruitful land and a friendly people.
 Notwithstanding the decay of agriculture, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> still supplied the granaries of Rome; the farmers were graciously exempted from the oppression of military quarters; and the Goths, who trusted the defence of the island to the inhabitants, had some reason to complain that their confidence was ungratefully betrayed.
 Instead of soliciting and expecting the aid of the king of Italy, they yielded to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> summons a cheerful obedience; and this province, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fruits of the Punic wars, was again, after a long separation, united to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
(57) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> garrison of Palermo, which alone attempted to resist, was reduced, after a short siege, by a singular stratagem.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> introduced his ships into the deepest recess of the harbour; their boats were laboriously hoisted with ropes and pulleys to the top-mast head, and he filled them with archers, who, from that superior station, commanded the ramparts of the city.
 After this easy though successful campaign, the conqueror entered <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> in triumph, at the head of his victorious bands, distributing gold medals to the people, on the day which so gloriously terminated the year of the consulship.
 He passed the <DATE>winter</DATE> season in the palace of ancient kings, amidst the ruins of a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> colony which once extended to a circumference of two-and-twenty miles;(58) but in the spring, about the festival of Easter, the prosecution of his designs was interrupted by a dangerous revolt of the <NORP>African</NORP> forces.
 <GPE>Carthage</GPE> was saved by the presence of Belisarius, who suddenly landed with a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> guards.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers of doubtful faith returned to the standard of their old commander, and he marched, without hesitation, above <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> miles, to seek an enemy whom he affected to pity and despise.
 Eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> rebels trembled at his approach; they were routed at the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset by the dexterity of their master, and this ignoble victory would have restored the peace of Africa, if the conqueror had not been hastily recalled to <GPE>Sicily</GPE> to appease a sedition which was kindled during his absence in his own camp.
(59) Disorder and disobedi ence were the common malady of the times: the genius to command and the virtue to obey resided only in the mind of Belisarius.
 Reign and weakness of Theodatus, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king of Italy, A.
D.
 534, October - A.
D.
 536, August.
.
 Although <PERSON>Theodatus</PERSON> descended from a race of heroes, he was ignorant of the art, and averse to the dangers, of war.
 Although he had studied the writings of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> and Tully, philosophy was incapable of purifying his mind from the basest passions, avarice and fear.
 He had purchased a sceptre by ingratitude and murder: at the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> menace of an enemy, he degraded his own majesty and that of a nation, which already disdained their unworthy sovereign.
 Astonished by the recent example of Gelimer, he saw himself dragged in chains through the streets of Constantinople: the terrors which <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> inspired were heightened by the eloquence of Peter, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> ambassador; and that bold and subtle advocate persuaded him to sign a treaty, too ignominious to become the foundation of a lasting peace.
 It was stipulated, that in the acclamations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, the name of the emperor should be always proclaimed before that of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king; and that as often as the statue of <PERSON>Theodatus</PERSON> was erected in brass on marble, the divine image of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> should be placed on its right hand.
 Instead of conferring, the king of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was reduced to solicit, the honours of the senate; and the consent of the emperor was made indispensable before he could execute, against a priest or senator, the sentence either of death or confiscation.
 The feeble monarch resigned the possession of Sicily; offered, as the annual mark of his dependence, a crown of gold of the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred pounds; and promised to supply, at the requisition of his sovereign, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Gothic</NORP> auxiliaries, for the service of the empire.
 Satisfied with these extraordinary concessions, the successful agent of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> hastened his journey to Constantinople; but no sooner had he reached the <PERSON>Alban</PERSON> villa, (60) than he was recalled by the anxiety of Theodatus; and the dialogue which passed between the king and the ambassador deserves to be represented in its original simplicity.
 This reasoning might not convince, but it was sufficient to alarm and subdue the weakness of Theodatus; and he soon descended to his last offer, that for the poor equivalent of a pension of forty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling, he would resign the kingdom of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Italians, and spend the remainder of his days in the innocent pleasures of philosophy and agriculture.
 Both treaties were entrusted to the hands of the ambassador, on the frail security of an oath not to produce the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> till the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> had been positively rejected.
 The event may be easily foreseen: <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> required and accepted the abdication of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king.
 His indefatigable agent returned from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to Ravenna, with ample instructions; and a fair epistle, which praised the wisdom and generosity of the royal philosopher, granted his pension, with the assurance of such honours as a subject and a <NORP>Catholic</NORP> might enjoy; and wisely referred the final execution of the treaty to the presence and authority of Belisarius.
 But in the interval of suspense, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals, who had entered the province of Dalmatia, were defeated and slain by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> troops.
 From blind and abject despair, <PERSON>Theodatus</PERSON> capriciously rose to groundless and fatal presumption, (61) and dared to receive, with menace and contempt, the ambassador of Justinian; who claimed his promise, solicited the allegiance of his subjects, and boldly asserted the inviolable privilege of his own character.
 The march of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> dispelled this visionary pride; and as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> campaign (62) was employed in the reduction of Sicily, the invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> is applied by <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> to the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> year of the GOTHIC WAR.
 (63) <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> invades Italy, and reducces Naples, A.
D.
 537.
.
 After <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> had left sufficient garrisons in <GPE>Palermo</GPE> and Syracuse, he embarked his troops at Messina, and landed them, without resistance, on the opposite shores of Rhegium.
 A <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince, who had married the daughter of Theodatus, was stationed with an army to guard the entrance of Italy; but he imitated, without scruple, the example of a sovereign faithless to his public and private duties.
 The perfidious <PERSON>Ebermor</PERSON> deserted with his followers to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> camp, and was dismissed to enjoy the servile honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (64) From <GPE>Rhegium</GPE> to Naples, the fleet and army of Belisarius, almost always in view of each other, advanced near <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred miles along the sea-coast.
 The people of Bruttium, Lucania, and Campania, who abhorred the name and religion of the Goths, embraced the specious excuse, that their ruined walls were incapable of defence: the soldiers paid a just equivalent for a plentiful market; and curiosity alone interrupted the peaceful occupations of the husbandman or artificer.
 Naples, which has swelled to a great and populous capital, long cherished the language and manners of a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> colony; (65) and the choice of <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> had ennobled this elegant retreat, which attracted the lovers of repose and study, elegant retreat, which attracted the lovers of repose and study, from the noise, the smoke, and the laborious opulence of Rome.
 (66) As soon as the place was invested by sea and land, <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> gave audience to the deputies of the people, who exhorted him to disregard a conquest unworthy of his arms, to seek the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king in a field of battle, and, after his victory, to claim, as the sovereign of Rome, the allegiance of the dependent cities.
 The impatience of delay urged him to grant the most liberal terms; his honour secured their performance: but <GPE>Naples</GPE> was divided into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> democracy was inflamed by their orators, who, with much spirit and some truth, represented to the multitude that the <NORP>Goths</NORP> would punish their defection, and that <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> himself must esteem their loyalty and valour.
 Their deliberations, however, were not perfectly free: the city was commanded by eight hundred Barbarians, whose wives and children were detained at <PERSON>Ravenna</PERSON> as the pledge of their fidelity; and even the Jews, who were rich and numerous, resisted, with desperate enthusiasm, the intolerant laws of Justinian.
 In a much later period, the circumference of <GPE>Naples</GPE> (67) measured only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> paces: (68) the fortifications were defended by precipices or the sea; when the aqueducts were intercepted, a supply of water might be drawn from wells and fountains; and the stock of provisions was sufficient to consume the patience of the besiegers.
 At the end of twenty days, that of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was almost exhausted, and he had reconciled himself to the disgrace of abandoning the siege, that he might march, before the <DATE>winter</DATE> season, against <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king.
 But his anxiety was relieved by the bold curiosity of an Isaurian, who explored the dry channel of an aqueduct, and secretly reported, that a passage might be perforated to introduce a file of armed soldiers into the heart of the city.
 When the work had been silently executed, the humane general risked the discovery of his secret by a last and fruitless admonition of the impending danger.
 In the darkness of the night, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Romans</NORP> entered the aqueduct, raised themselves by a rope, which they fastened to an olive-tree, into the house or garden of a solitary matron, sounded their trumpets, surprised the sentinels, and gave admittance to their companions, who on all sides scaled the walls, and burst open the gates of the city.
 Every crime which is punished by social justice was practised as the rights of war; the <PERSON>Huns</PERSON> were distinguished by cruelty and sacrilege, and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> alone appeared in the streets and churches of <GPE>Naples</GPE> to moderate the calamities which he predicted.
 The city was saved by the virtue and authority of its conqueror; (69) and when the <NORP>Neapolitans</NORP> returned to their houses, they found some consolation in the secret enjoyment of their hidden treasures.
 The <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> garrison enlisted in the service of the emperor; <PERSON>Apulia</PERSON> and Calabria, delivered from the odious presence of the Goths, acknowledged his dominion; and the tusks of the <NORP>Calydonian</NORP> boar, which were still shown at Beneventum, are curiously described by the historian of Belisarius.
 (70) Vitigese, king of Italy, A.
D.
 536, <DATE>August</DATE> - A.
D.
 540.
 The faithful soldiers and citizens of <GPE>Naples</GPE> had expected their deliverance from a prince, who remained the inactive and almost indifferent spectator of their ruin.
 <PERSON>Theodatus</PERSON> secured his person within the walls of Rome, whilst his cavalry advanced forty miles on the <NORP>Appian</NORP> way, and encamped in the Pomptine marshes; which, by a canal of nineteen miles in length, had been recently drained and converted into excellent pastures.
 (71) But the principal forces of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were dispersed in Dalmatia, Venetia, and Gaul; and the feeble mind of their king was confounded by the unsuccessful event of a divination, which seemed to presage the downfall of his empire.
 (72) The most abject slaves have arraigned the guilt or weakness of an unfortunate master.
 The character of <PERSON>Theodatus</PERSON> was rigorously scrutinized by a free and idle camp of Barbarians, conscious of their privilege and power: he was declared unworthy of his race, his nation, and his throne; and their general Vitiges, whose valour had been signalized in the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> war, was raised with unanimous applause on the bucklers of his companions.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rumor, the abdicated monarch fled from the justice of his country; but he was pursued by private revenge.
 A Goth, whom he had injured in his love, overtook <PERSON>Theodatus</PERSON> on the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way, and, regardless of his unmanly cries, slaughtered him, as he lay, prostrate on the ground, like a victim (says the historian) at the foot of the altar.
 The choice of the people is the best and purest title to reign over them; yet such is the prejudice of every age, that <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> impatiently wished to return to Ravenna, where he might seize, with the reluctant hand of the daughter of Amalasontha, some faint shadow of hereditary right.
 A national council was immediately held, and the new monarch reconciled the impatient spirit of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> to a measure of disgrace, which the misconduct of his predecessor rendered wise and indispensable.
 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> consented to retreat in the presence of a victorious enemy; to delay till the next <DATE>spring</DATE> the operations of offensive war; to summon their scattered forces; to relinquish their distant possessions, and to trust even <GPE>Rome</GPE> itself to the faith of its inhabitants.
 Leuderis, an ancient warrior, was left in the capital with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers; a feeble garrison, which might have seconded the zeal, though it was incapable of opposing the wishes, of the Romans.
 But a momentary enthusiasm of religion and patriotism was kindled in their minds.
 They furiously exclaimed, that the apostolic throne should no longer be profaned by the triumph or toleration of Arianism; that the tombs of the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> should no longer be trampled by the savages of the North; and, without reflecting, that <GPE>Italy</GPE> must sink into a province of Constantinople, they fondly hailed the restoration of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor as a new aera of freedom and prosperity.
 The deputies of the pope and clergy, of the senate and people, invited the lieutenant of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> to accept their voluntary allegiance, and to enter the city, whose gates would be thrown open for his reception.
 As soon as <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> had fortified his new conquests, <GPE>Naples</GPE> and Cumae, he advanced about twenty miles to the banks of the Vulturnus, contemplated the decayed grandeur of Capua, and halted at the separation of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> and <NORP>Appian</NORP> ways.
 The work of the censor, after the incessant use of nine centuries, still preserved its primaeval beauty, and not a flaw could be discovered in the large polished stones, of which that solid, though narrow road, was so firmly compacted.
 (73) Belisarius, however, preferred the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> way, which, at a distance from the sea and the marshes, skirted in a space of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and twenty miles along the foot of the mountains.
 His enemies had disappeared: <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> enters Rome, A.
D.
 536, Dec.
 10.
 when he made his entrance through the <NORP>Asinarian</NORP> gate, the garrison departed without molestation along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way; and the city, after sixty years' servitude, was delivered from the yoke of the Barbarians.
 <PERSON>Leuderis</PERSON> alone, from a motive of pride or discontent, refused to accompany the fugitives; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> chief, himself a trophy of the victory, was sent with the keys of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the throne of the emperor Justinian.
 (74) Siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 537, March.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days, which coincided with the old Saturnalia, were devoted to mutual congratulation and the public joy; and the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> prepared to celebrate, without a rival, the approaching festival of the nativity of Christ.
 In the familiar conversation of a hero, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> acquired some notion of the virtues which history ascribed to their ancestors; they were edified by the apparent respect of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> for the successor of St.
 Peter, and his rigid discipline secured in the midst of war the blessings of tranquillity and justice.
 They applauded the rapid success of his arms, which overran the adjacent country, as far as Narni, Perusia, and Spoleto; but they trembled, the senate, the clergy, and the unwarlike people, as soon as they understood that he had resolved, and would speedily be reduced, to sustain a siege against the powers of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> monarchy.
 The designs of <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> were executed, during the <DATE>winter</DATE> season, with diligence and effect.
 From their rustic habitations, from their distant garrisons, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> assembled at <PERSON>Ravenna</PERSON> for the defence of their country; and such were their numbers, that, after an army had been detached for the relief of Dalmatia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men marched under the royal standard.
 According to the degrees of rank or merit, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king distributed arms and horses, rich gifts, and liberal promises; he moved along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way, declined the useless sieges of <GPE>Perusia</GPE> and Spoleto, respected he impregnable rock of Narni, and arrived within <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at the foot of the <GPE>Milvian</GPE> bridge.
 The narrow passage was fortified with a tower, and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> had computed the value of the twenty days which must be lost in the construction of another bridge.
 But the consternation of the soldiers of the tower, who either fled or deserted, disappointed his hopes, and betrayed his person into the most imminent danger.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general sallied from the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> gate to mark the ground of an advantageous position, and to survey the camp of the Barbarians; but while he still believed them on the other side of the Tyber, he was suddenly encompassed and assaulted by their numerous squadrons.
 The fate of <GPE>Italy</GPE> depended on his life; and the deserters pointed to the conspicuous horse a bay, (75) with a white face, which he rode on that memorable day.
 "Aim at the bay horse," was the universal cry.
 Every bow was bent, every javelin was directed, against that fatal object, and the command was repeated and obeyed by <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> who were ignorant of its real motive.
 The bolder <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> advanced to the more honourable combat of swords and spears; and the praise of an enemy has graced the fall of Visandus, the standard-bearer, (76) who maintained his foremost station, till he was pierced with <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> wounds, perhaps by the hand of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> himself.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general was strong, active, and dexterous; on every side he discharged his weighty and mortal strokes: his faithful guards imitated his valour, and defended his person; and the Goths, after the loss of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men, fled before the arms of a hero.
 They were rashly pursued to their camp; and the Romans, oppressed by multitudes, made a gradual, and at length a precipitate retreat to the gates of the city: the gates were shut against the fugitives; and the public terror was increased, by the report that <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was slain.
 <PERSON>Valour</PERSON> of Belisarius.
 His countenance was indeed disfigured by sweat, dust, and blood; his voice was hoarse, his strength was almost exhausted; but his unconquerable spirit still remained; he imparted that spirit to his desponding companions; and their last desperate charge was felt by the flying Barbarians, as if a new army, vigorous and entire, had been poured from the city.
 The <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> gate was thrown open to a real triumph; but it was not before <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> had visited every post, and provided for the public safety, that he could be persuaded, by his wife and friends, to taste the needful refreshments of food and sleep.
 In the more improved state of the art of war, a general is seldom required, or even permitted to display the personal prowess of a soldier; and the example of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> may be added to the rare examples of Henry IV.
, of Pyrrhus, and of Alexander.
 His defence of Rome.
 After this <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and unsuccessful trial of their enemies, the whole army of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> passed the Tyber, and formed the siege of the city, which continued above a year, till their final departure.
 Whatever fancy may conceive, the severe compass of the geographer defines the circumference of <GPE>Rome</GPE> within a line of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-five paces; and that circumference, except in the Vatican, has invariably been the same from the triumph of <GPE>Aurelian</GPE> to the peaceful but obscure reign of the modern popes.
 (77) But in the day of her greatness, the space within her walls was crowded with habitations and inhabitants; and the populous suburbs, that stretched along the public roads, were darted like so many rays from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> common centre.
 Adversity swept away these extraneous ornaments, and left naked and desolate a considerable part even of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hills.
 Yet <GPE>Rome</GPE> in its present state could send into the field about <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> males of a military age; (78) and, notwithstanding the want of discipline and exercise, the far greater part, inured to the hardships of poverty, might be capable of bearing arms for the defence of their country and religion.
 The prudence of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> did not neglect this important resource.
 His soldiers were relieved by the zeal and diligence of the people, who watched while they slept, and labored while they reposed: he accepted the voluntary service of the bravest and most indigent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> youth; and the companies of townsmen sometimes represented, in a vacant post, the presence of the troops which had been drawn away to more essential duties.
 But his just confidence was placed in the veterans who had fought under his banner in the <NORP>Persian</NORP> and <NORP>African</NORP> wars; and although that gallant band was reduced to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men, he undertook, with such contemptible numbers, to defend a circle of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, against an army of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Barbarians.
 In the walls of Rome, which <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> constructed or restored, the materials of ancient architecture may be discerned; (79) and the whole fortification was completed, except in a chasm still extant between the <NORP>Pincian</NORP> and <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> gates, which the prejudices of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and <NORP>Romans</NORP> left under the effectual guard of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> the apostle.
 (80) The battlements or bastions were shaped in sharp angles a ditch, broad and deep, protected the foot of the rampart; and the archers on the rampart were assisted by military engines; the balista, a powerful cross-bow, which darted short but massy arrows; the onagri, or wild asses, which, on the principle of a sling, threw stones and bullets of an enormous size.
 (81) A chain was drawn across the Tyber; the arches of the aqueducts were made impervious, and the mole or sepulchre of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> (82) was converted, for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time, to the uses of a citadel.
 That venerable structure, which contained the ashes of the Antonines, was a circular turret rising from a quadrangular basis; it was covered with the white marble of Paros, and decorated by the statues of gods and heroes; and the lover of the arts must read with a sigh, that the works of <NORP>Praxiteles</NORP> or <PERSON>Lysippus</PERSON> were torn from their lofty pedestals, and hurled into the ditch on the heads of the besiegers.
 (83) To each of his lieutenants <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> assigned the defence of a gate, with the wise and peremptory instruction, that, whatever might be the alarm, they should steadily adhere to their respective posts, and trust their general for the safety of Rome.
 The formidable host of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was insufficient to embrace the ample measure of the city, of the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> gates, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> only were invested from the <NORP>Proenestine</NORP> to the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way; and <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> divided his troops into <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> camps, each of which was fortified with a ditch and rampart.
 On the <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> side of the river, a <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> encampment was formed in the field or circus of the Vatican, for the important purpose of commanding the <GPE>Milvian</GPE> bridge and the course of the Tyber; but they approached with devotion the adjacent church of St.
 Peter; and the threshold of the holy apostles was respected during the siege by a <NORP>Christian</NORP> enemy.
 In the ages of victory, as often as the senate decreed some distant conquest, the consul denounced hostilities, by unbarring, in solemn pomp, the gates of the temple of Janus.
 (84) Domestic war now rendered the admonition superfluous, and the ceremony was superseded by the establishment of a new religion.
 But the brazen temple of <PERSON>Janus</PERSON> was left standing in the forum; of a size sufficient only to contain the statue of the god, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> cubits in height, of a human form, but with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> faces directed to the east and west.
 The double gates were likewise of brass; and a fruitless effort to turn them on their rusty hinges revealed the scandalous secret that some <NORP>Romans</NORP> were still attached to the superstition of their ancestors.
 Repulses a general assault of the Goths.
 Eighteen days were employed by the besiegers, to provide all the instruments of attack which antiquity had invented.
 Fascines were prepared to fill the ditches, scaling-ladders to ascend the walls.
 The largest trees of the forest supplied the timbers of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> battering-rams: their heads were armed with iron; they were suspended by ropes, and each of them was worked by the labor of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> men.
 The lofty wooden turrets moved on wheels or rollers, and formed a spacious platform of the level of the rampart.
 On the morning of the nineteenth day, a general attack was made from the <NORP>Praenestine</NORP> gate to the Vatican: <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <NORP>Gothic</NORP> columns, with their military engines, advanced to the assault; and the Romans, who lined the ramparts, listened with doubt and anxiety to the cheerful assurances of their commander.
 As soon as the enemy approached the ditch, <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> himself drew the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> arrow; and such was his strength and dexterity, that he transfixed the foremost of the <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> leaders.
 As shout of applause and victory was reechoed along the wall.
 He drew a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> arrow, and the stroke was followed with the same success and the same acclamation.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general then gave the word, that the archers should aim at the teams of oxen; they were instantly covered with mortal wounds; the towers which they drew remained useless and immovable, and a single moment disconcerted the laborious projects of the king of the Goths.
 After this disappointment, <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> still continued, or feigned to continue, the assault of the <NORP>Salarian</NORP> gate, that he might divert the attention of his adversary, while his principal forces more strenuously attacked the <NORP>Praenestine</NORP> gate and the sepulchre of Hadrian, at the distance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles from each other.
 Near the former, the double walls of the <FAC>Vivarium</FAC> (85) were low or broken; the fortifications of the latter were feebly guarded: the vigor of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was excited by the hope of victory and spoil; and if a single post had given way, the Romans, and <GPE>Rome</GPE> itself, were irrecoverably lost.
 This perilous day was the most glorious in the life of Belisarius.
 Amidst tumult and dismay, the whole plan of the attack and defence was distinctly present to his mind; he observed the changes of each instant, weighed every possible advantage, transported his person to the scenes of danger, and communicated his spirit in calm and decisive orders.
 The contest was fiercely maintained from the morning to the evening; the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were repulsed on all sides; and each <NORP>Roman</NORP> might boast that he had vanquished <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> Barbarians, if the strange disproportion of numbers were not counterbalanced by the merit of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> man.
 Thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Goths, according to the confession of their own chiefs, perished in this bloody action; and the multitude of the wounded was equal to that of the slain.
 When they advanced to the assault, their close disorder suffered not a javelin to fall without effect; and as they retired, the populace of the city joined the pursuit, and slaughtered, with impunity, the backs of their flying enemies.
 His sallies.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> instantly sallied from the gates; and while the soldiers chanted his name and victory, the hostile engines of war were reduced to ashes.
 Such was the loss and consternation of the Goths, that, from this day, the siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> degenerated into a tedious and indolent blockade; and they were incessantly harassed by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, who, in frequent skirmishes, destroyed above <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of their bravest troops.
 Their cavalry was unpractised in the use of the bow; their archers served on foot; and this divided force was incapable of contending with their adversaries, whose lances and arrows, at a distance, or at hand, were alike formidable.
 The consummate skill of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> embraced the favorable opportunities; and as he chose the ground and the moment, as he pressed the charge or sounded the retreat, (86) the squadrons which he detached were seldom unsuccessful.
 These partial advantages diffused an impatient ardor among the soldiers and people, who began to feel the hardships of a siege, and to disregard the dangers of a general engagement.
 Each plebeian conceived himself to be a hero, and the infantry, who, since the decay of discipline, were rejected from the line of battle, aspired to the ancient honours of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legion.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> praised the spirit of his troops, condemned their presumption, yielded to their clamours, and prepared the remedies of a defeat, the possibility of which he alone had courage to suspect.
 In the quarter of the Vatican, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> prevailed; and if the irreparable moments had not been wasted in the pillage of the camp, they might have occupied the <GPE>Milvian</GPE> bridge, and charged in the rear of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> host.
 On the other side of the Tyber, <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> advanced from the <NORP>Pincian</NORP> and <NORP>Salarian</NORP> gates.
 But his army, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers perhaps, was lost in a spacious plain; they were encompassed and oppressed by fresh multitudes, who continually relieved the broken ranks of the Barbarians.
 The valiant leaders of the infantry were unskilled to conquer; they died: the retreat (a hasty retreat) was covered by the prudence of the general, and the victors started back with affright from the formidable aspect of an armed rampart.
 The reputation of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was unsullied by a defeat; and the vain confidence of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was not less serviceable to his designs than the repentance and modesty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops.
 Distress of the city.
 From the moment that <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> had determined to sustain a siege, his assiduous care provided <GPE>Rome</GPE> against the danger of famine, more dreadful than the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms.
 An extraordinary supply of corn was imported from Sicily: the harvests of <LOC>Campania</LOC> and <GPE>Tuscany</GPE> were forcibly swept for the use of the city; and the rights of private property were infringed by the strong plea of the public safety.
 It might easily be foreseen that the enemy would intercept the aqueducts; and the cessation of the water-mills was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> inconvenience, which was speedily removed by mooring large vessels, and fixing mill-stones in the current of the river.
 The stream was soon embarrassed by the trunks of trees, and polluted with dead bodies; yet so effectual were the precautions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, that the waters of the <NORP>Tyber</NORP> still continued to give motion to the mills and drink to the inhabitants: the more distant quarters were supplied from domestic wells; and a besieged city might support, without impatience, the privation of her public baths.
 A large portion of Rome, from the <NORP>Praenestine</NORP> gate to the church of St.
 Paul, was never invested by the Goths; their excursions were restrained by the activity of the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> troops: the navigation of the Tyber, and the Latin, Appian, and <NORP>Ostian</NORP> ways, were left free and unmolested for the introduction of corn and cattle, or the retreat of the inhabitants, who sought refuge in <LOC>Campania</LOC> or Sicily.
 Anxious to relieve himself from a useless and devouring multitude, <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> issued his peremptory orders for the instant departure of the women, the children, and slaves; required his soldiers to dismiss their male and female attendants, and regulated their allowance that <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety should be given in provisions, and the other in money.
 His foresight was justified by the increase of the public distress, as soon as the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had occupied <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> important posts in the neighbourhood of Rome.
 By the loss of the port, or, as it is now called, the city of Porto, he was deprived of the country on the right of the Tyber, and the best communication with the sea; and he reflected, with grief and anger, that <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred men, could he have spared such a feeble band, might have defended its impregnable works.
 Seven miles from the capital, between the <NORP>Appian</NORP> and the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> ways, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal aqueducts crossing, and again crossing each other: enclosed within their solid and lofty arches a fortified space, (87) where <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> established a camp of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to intercept the convoy of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Campania.
 The granaries of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were insensibly exhausted, the adjacent country had been wasted with fire and sword; such scanty supplies as might yet be obtained by hasty excursions were the reward of valour, and the purchase of wealth: the forage of the horses, and the bread of the soldiers, never failed: but in the last months of the siege, the people were exposed to the miseries of scarcity, unwholesome food, (88) and contagious disorders.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> saw and pitied their sufferings; but he had foreseen, and he watched the decay of their loyalty, and the progress of their discontent.
 Adversity had awakened the <NORP>Romans</NORP> from the dreams of grandeur and freedom, and taught them the humiliating lesson, that it was of small moment to their real happiness, whether the name of their master was derived from the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> or the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> language.
 The lieutenant of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> listened to their just complaints, but he rejected with disdain the idea of flight or capitulation; repressed their clamorous impatience for battle; amused them with the prospect of a sure and speedy relief; and secured himself and the city from the effects of their despair or treachery.
 Twice in each month he changed the station of the officers to whom the custody of the gates was committed: the various precautions of patroles, watch words, lights, and music, were repeatedly employed to discover whatever passed on the ramparts; out-guards were posted beyond the ditch, and the trusty vigilance of dogs supplied the more doubtful fidelity of mankind.
 A letter was intercepted, which assured the king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> that the <NORP>Asinarian</NORP> gate, adjoining to the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> church, should be secretly opened to his troops.
 On the proof or suspicion of treason, several senators were banished, Exile of Pope sylverius, A.

 and the pope <PERSON>Sylverius</PERSON> was summoned to attend the representative of his sovereign, at his head-quarters in the <NORP>Pincian</NORP> palace.
 (89) The ecclesiastics, who followed their bishop, were detained in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> or <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> apartment, (90) and he alone was admitted to the presence of Belisarius.
 The conqueror of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Carthage</GPE> was modestly seated at the feet of Antonina, who reclined on a stately couch: the general was silent, but the voice of reproach and menace issued from the mouth of his imperious wife.
 Accused by credible witnesses, and the evidence of his own subscription, the successor of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> was despoiled of his pontifical ornaments, clad in the mean habit of a monk, and embarked, without delay, for a distant exile in the East.
 At the emperor's command, the clergy of <GPE>Rome</GPE> proceeded to the choice of a new bishop; and after a solemn invocation of the Holy Ghost, elected the deacon Vigilius, who had purchased the papal throne by a bribe of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred pounds of gold.
 The profit, and consequently the guilt, of this simony, was imputed to Belisarius: but the hero obeyed the orders of his wife; <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> served the passions of the empress; and <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> lavished her treasures, in the vain hope of obtaining a pontiff hostile or indifferent to the council of Chalcedon.
 (91) Deliverance of the city.
 The epistle of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> to the emperor announced his victory, his danger, and his resolution.
 Perhaps that reign would have been equally prosperous if the peaceful master of the <LOC>East</LOC> had abstained from the conquest of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Italy: but as <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was ambitious of fame, he made some efforts (they were feeble and languid) to support and rescue his victorious general.
 A reinforcement of <DATE>sixteen</DATE> hundred <NORP>Sclavonians</NORP> and <PERSON>Huns</PERSON> was led by <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> and Valerian; and as they reposed during the <DATE>winter</DATE> season in the harbours of Greece, the strength of the men and horses was not impaired by the fatigues of a sea-voyage; and they distinguished their valour in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> sally against the besiegers.
 About the time of the <DATE>summer</DATE> solstice, <PERSON>Euthalius</PERSON> landed at <GPE>Terracina</GPE> with large sums of money for the payment of the troops: he cautiously proceeded along the <NORP>Appian</NORP> way, and this convoy entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> through the gate Capena, (92) while Belisarius, on the other side, diverted the attention of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> by a vigorous and successful skirmish.
 These seasonable aids, the use and reputation of which were dexterously managed by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, revived the courage, or at least the hopes, of the soldiers and people.
 The historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> was despatched with an important commission to collect the troops and provisions which <LOC>Campania</LOC> could furnish, or <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had sent; and the secretary of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was soon followed by <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> herself, (93) who boldly traversed the posts of the enemy, and returned with the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> succours to the relief of her husband and the besieged city.
 A fleet of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Isaurians</NORP> cast anchor in the Bay of <GPE>Naples</GPE> and afterwards at Ostia.
 Above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse, of whom a part were Thracians, landed at Tarentum; and, after the junction of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers of Campania, and a train of wagons laden with wine and flour, they directed their march on the <NORP>Appian</NORP> way, from <GPE>Capua</GPE> to the neighbourhood of Rome.
 The forces that arrived by land and sea were united at the mouth of the Tyber.
 <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> convened a council of war: it was resolved to surmount, with sails and oars, the adverse stream of the river; and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were apprehensive of disturbing, by any rash hostilities, the negotiation to which <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> had craftily listened.
 They credulously believed that they saw no more than the vanguard of a fleet and army, which already covered the Ionian Sea and the plains of Campania; and the illusion was supported by the haughty language of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, when he gave audience to the ambassadors of Vitiges.
 After a specious discourse to vindicate the justice of his cause, they declared, that, for the sake of peace, they were disposed to renounce the possession of Sicily.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> rejected with equal firmness and contempt the offer of a tribute; but he allowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> ambassadors to seek their fate from the mouth of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> himself; and consented, with seeming reluctance, to a truce of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months, from the <DATE>winter</DATE> solstice to the equinox of spring.
 <PERSON>Prudence</PERSON> might not safely trust either the oaths or hostages of the Barbarians, and the conscious superiority of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> chief was expressed in the distribution of his troops.
Belisarius recovers many cities of Italy.
 As soon as fear or hunger compelled the <NORP>Goths</NORP> to evacuate Alba, Porto, and Centumcellae, their place was instantly supplied; the garrisons of Narni, Spoleto, and Perusia, were reinforced, and the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> camps of the besiegers were gradually encompassed with the calamities of a siege.
 The prayers and pilgrimage of Datius, bishop of Milan, were not without effect; and he obtained <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Thracians</NORP> and Isaurians, to assist the revolt of <GPE>Liguria</GPE> against her <NORP>Arian</NORP> tyrant.
 At the same time, <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Sanguinary, (94) the nephew of Vitalian, was detached with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> chosen horse, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to Alba, on the Fucine Lake, and afterwards to the frontiers of Picenum, on the <NORP>Hadriatic</NORP> Sea.
 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> raise the siege of Rome, A.
D.
 538, March.
 The whole nation of the <NORP>Ostrogoths</NORP> had been assembled for the attack, and was almost entirely consumed in the siege of Rome.
 If any credit be due to an intelligent spectator, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> at least of their enormous host was destroyed, in frequent and bloody combats under the walls of the city.
 The bad fame and pernicious qualities of the <DATE>summer</DATE> air might already be imputed to the decay of agriculture and population; and the evils of famine and pestilence were aggravated by their own licentiousness, and the unfriendly disposition of the country.
 While <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> struggled with his fortune, while he hesitated between shame and ruin, his retreat was hastened by domestic alarms.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was informed by trembling messengers, that <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Sanguinary spread the devastations of war from the <PRODUCT>Apennine</PRODUCT> to the Hadriatic; that the rich spoils and innumerable captives of <GPE>Picenum</GPE> were lodged in the fortifications of Rimini; and that this formidable chief had defeated his uncle, insulted his capital, and seduced, by secret correspondence, the fidelity of his wife, the imperious daughter of Amalasontha.
 Yet, before he retired, <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> made a last effort, either to storm or to surprise the city.
 A secret passage was discovered in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the aqueducts; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> citizens of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> were tempted by bribes to intoxicate the guards of the <GPE>Aurelian</GPE> gate; an attack was meditated on the walls beyond the Tyber, in a place which was not fortified with towers; and the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> advanced, with torches and scaling-ladders, to the assault of the <NORP>Pincian</NORP> gate.
 But every attempt was defeated by the intrepid vigilance of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> and his band of veterans, who, in the most perilous moments, did not regret the absence of their companions; and the Goths, alike destitute of hope and subsistence, clamorously urged their departure before the truce should expire, and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> cavalry should again be united.
 One year and nine days after the commencement of the siege, an army, so lately strong and triumphant, burnt their tents, and tumultuously repassed the <GPE>Milvian</GPE> bridge.
 They repassed not with impunity: their thronging multitudes, oppressed in a narrow passage, were driven headlong into the Tyber, by their own fears and the pursuit of the enemy; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, sallying from the <NORP>Pincian</NORP> gate, inflicted a severe and disgraceful wound on their retreat.
 The slow length of a sickly and desponding host was heavily dragged along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way; from whence the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were sometimes compelled to deviate, lest they should encounter the hostile garrisons that guarded the high road to <GPE>Rimini</GPE> and Ravenna.
 Yet so powerful was this flying army, that <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> spared <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men for the defence of the cities which he was most solicitous to preserve, and detached his nephew Uraias, with an adequate force, for the chastisement of rebellious Milan.
 At the head of his principal army, he besieged Rimini, only thirty-three miles distant from the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> capital.
 A feeble rampart, and a shallow ditch, were maintained by the skill and valour of <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Sanguinary, who shared the danger and fatigue of the meanest soldier, and emulated, on a theatre less illustrious, the military virtues of his great commander.
 Lose Rimini.
 The towers and battering-engines of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were rendered useless; their attacks were repulsed; and the tedious blockade, which reduced the garrison to the last extremity of hunger, afforded time for the union and march of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> forces.
 A fleet, which had surprised Ancona, sailed along the coast of the Hadriatic, to the relief of the besieged city.
 The eunuch <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> landed in <GPE>Picenum</GPE> with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Heruli</PERSON> and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the bravest troops of the East.
 The rock of the <PRODUCT>Apennine</PRODUCT> was forced; <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans moved round the foot of the mountains, under the command of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> himself; and a new army, whose encampment blazed with innumerable lights, appeared to advance along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way.
 retire to Ravenna.
 Overwhelmed with astonishment and despair, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> abandoned the siege of Rimini, their tents, their standards, and their leaders; and Vitiges, who gave or followed the example of flight, never halted till he found a shelter within the walls and morasses of Ravenna.
 Jealousy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals, A.
D.
 538.
 To these walls, and to some fortresses destitute of any mutual support, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> monarchy was now reduced.
 The provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had embraced the party of the emperor and his army, gradually recruited to the number of twenty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men, must have achieved an easy and rapid conquest, if their invincible powers had not been weakened by the discord of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> chiefs.
 Before the end of the siege, an act of blood, ambiguous and indiscreet, sullied the fair fame of Belisarius.
 Presidius, a loyal Italian, as he fled from <PERSON>Ravenna</PERSON> to Rome, was rudely stopped by Constantine, the military governor of Spoleto, and despoiled, even in a church, of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> daggers richly inlaid with gold and precious stones.
 As soon as the public danger had subsided, <PERSON>Presidius</PERSON> complained of the loss and injury: his complaint was heard, but the order of restitution was disobeyed by the pride and avarice of the offender.
 Exasperated by the delay, <PERSON>Presidius</PERSON> boldly arrested the general's horse as he passed through the forum; and, with the spirit of a citizen, demanded the common benefit of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> laws.
 The honour of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was engaged; he summoned a council; claimed the obedience of his subordinate officer; and was provoked, by an insolent reply, to call hastily for the presence of his guards.
 Constantine, viewing their entrance as the signal of death, drew his sword, and rushed on the general, who nimbly eluded the stroke, and was protected by his friends;Death of Constantine.
 while the desperate assassin was disarmed, dragged into a neighbouring chamber, and executed, or rather murdered, by the guards, at the arbitrary command of Belisarius.
 (95) In this hasty act of violence, the guilt of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was no longer remembered; the despair and death of that valiant officer were secretly imputed to the revenge of Antonina; and each of his colleagues, conscious of the same rapine, was apprehensive of the same fate.
 The fear of a common enemy suspended the effects of their envy and discontent; but in the confidence of approaching victory, they instigated a powerful rival to oppose the conqueror of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Africa.

 From the domestic service of the palace, and the administration of the private revenue, <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> the eunuch was suddenly exalted to the head of an army; and the spirit of a hero, who afterwards equalled the merit and glory of Belisarius, served only to perplex the operations of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war.
 To his prudent counsels, the relief of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was ascribed by the leaders of the discontented faction, who exhorted <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> to assume an independent and separate command.
 The epistle of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> had indeed enjoined his obedience to the general; but the dangerous exception, "as far as may be advantageous to the public service," reserved some freedom of judgment to the discreet favorite, who had so lately departed from the sacred and familiar conversation of his sovereign.
 In the exercise of this doubtful right, the eunuch perpetually dissented from the opinions of Belisarius; and, after yielding with reluctance to the siege of Urbino, he deserted his colleague in the night, and marched away to the conquest of the <NORP>Aemilian</NORP> province.
 The fierce and formidable bands of the <PERSON>Heruli</PERSON> were attached to the person of Narses; (96) <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Romans</NORP> and confederates were persuaded to march under his banners; every malecontent embraced the fair opportunity of revenging his private or imaginary wrongs; and the remaining troops of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> were divided and dispersed from the garrisons of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> to the shores of the Hadriatic.
 Firmness and authority of Belisarius.
 His skill and perseverance overcame every obstacle: <GPE>Urbino</GPE> was taken, the sieges of <NORP>Faesulae</NORP> Orvieto, and Auximum, were undertaken and vigorously prosecuted; and the eunuch <PERSON>Narses</PERSON> was at length recalled to the domestic cares of the palace.
 All dissensions were healed, and all opposition was subdued, by the temperate authority of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, to whom his enemies could not refuse their esteem; and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> inculcated the salutary lesson that the forces of the state should compose <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> body, and be animated by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> soul.
 But in the interval of discord, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were permitted to breathe; an important season was lost, <GPE>Milan</GPE> was destroyed, and the northern provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> were afflicted by an inundation of the Franks.
 Invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Franks, A.
D.
 538, 539.
 When <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> meditated the conquest of Italy, he sent ambassadors to the kings of the Franks, and adjured them, by the common ties of alliance and religion, to join in the holy enterprise against the Arians.
 The Goths, as their wants were more urgent, employed a more effectual mode of persuasion, and vainly strove, by the gift of lands and money, to purchase the friendship, or at least the neutrality, of a light and perfidious nation.
 (97) But the arms of Belisarius, and the revolt of the Italians, had no sooner shaken the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> monarchy, than <PERSON>Theodebert</PERSON> of Austrasia, the most powerful and warlike of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> kings, was persuaded to succor their distress by an indirect and seasonable aid.
 Without expecting the consent of their sovereign, the <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Burgundians, his recent subjects, descended from the Alps, and joined the troops which <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> had sent to chastise the revolt of Milan.
 After an obstinate siege, the capital of <GPE>Liguria</GPE> was reduced by famine; but no capitulation could be obtained, except for the safe retreat of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> garrison.
 Datius, the orthodox bishop, who had seduced his countrymen to rebellion (98) and ruin, escaped to the luxury and honours of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court; (99) but the clergy, perhaps the <NORP>Arian</NORP> clergy, were slaughtered at the foot of their own altars by the defenders of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> faith.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> males were reported to be slain; (100) the female sex, and the more precious spoil, was resigned to the Burgundians; Destruction of Milan.
 and the houses, or at least the walls, of Milan, were levelled with the ground.
 The Goths, in their last moments, were revenged by the destruction of a city, <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> only to <GPE>Rome</GPE> in size and opulence, in the splendour of its buildings, or the number of its inhabitants; and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> sympathized alone in the fate of his deserted and devoted friends.
 Encouraged by this successful inroad, <PERSON>Theodebert</PERSON> himself, in the ensuing spring, invaded the plains of <GPE>Italy</GPE> with an army of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Barbarians.
 (101) The king, and some chosen followers, were mounted on horseback, and armed with lances; the infantry, without bows or spears, were satisfied with a shield, a sword, and a double-edged battle-axe, which, in their hands, became a deadly and unerring weapon.
 <GPE>Italy</GPE> trembled at the march of the Franks; and both the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, alike ignorant of their designs, solicited, with hope and terror, the friendship of these dangerous allies.
 Till he had secured the passage of the <PERSON>Po</PERSON> on the bridge of Pavia, the grandson of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> dissembled his intentions, which he at length declared, by assaulting, almost at the same instant, the hostile camps of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and Goths.
 Instead of uniting their arms, they fled with equal precipitation; and the fertile, though desolate provinces of <GPE>Liguria</GPE> and Aemilia, were abandoned to a licentious host of Barbarians, whose rage was not mitigated by any thoughts of settlement or conquest.
 Among the cities which they ruined, Genoa, not yet constructed of marble, is particularly enumerated; and the deaths of thousands, according to the regular practice of war, appear to have excited less horror than some idolatrous sacrifices of women and children, which were performed with impunity in the camp of the most <NORP>Christian</NORP> king.
 If it were not a melancholy truth, that the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most cruel sufferings must be the lot of the innocent and helpless, history might exult in the misery of the conquerors, who, in the midst of riches, were left destitute of bread or wine, reduced to drink the waters of the Po, and to feed on the flesh of distempered cattle.
 The dysentery swept away <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of their army; and the clamours of his subjects, who were impatient to pass the Alps, disposed <PERSON>Theodebert</PERSON> to listen with respect to the mild exhortations of Belisarius.
 The memory of this inglorious and destructive warfare was perpetuated on the medals of Gaul; and Justinian, without unsheathing his sword, assumed the title of conqueror of the Franks.
 The <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> prince was offended by the vanity of the emperor; he affected to pity the fallen fortunes of the Goths; and his insidious offer of a foederal union was fortified by the promise or menace of descending from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> at the head of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men.
 His plans of conquest were boundless, and perhaps chimerical.
 The king of <PERSON>Austrasia</PERSON> threatened to chastise Justinian, and to march to the gates of Constantinople: (102) he was overthrown and slain (103) by a wild bull, (104) as he hunted in the <NORP>Belgic</NORP> or <NORP>German</NORP> forests.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> besieges Ravenna; As soon as <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was delivered from his foreign and domestic enemies, he seriously applied his forces to the final reduction of Italy.
 In the siege of Osimo, the general was nearly transpierced with an arrow, if the mortal stroke had not been intercepted by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his guards, who lost, in that pious office, the use of his hand.
 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> of Osimo, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, with those of <NORP>Faesulae</NORP> and the Cottian Alps, were among the last who maintained their independence; and their gallant resistance, which almost tired the patience, deserved the esteem, of the conqueror.
 His prudence refused to subscribe the safe conduct which they asked, to join their brethren of Ravenna; but they saved, by an honourable capitulation, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety at least of their wealth, with the free alternative of retiring peaceably to their estates, or enlisting to serve the emperor in his <NORP>Persian</NORP> wars.
 The multitudes which yet adhered to the standard of <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> far surpassed the number of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops; but neither prayers nor defiance, nor the extreme danger of his most faithful subjects, could tempt the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king beyond the fortifications of Ravenna.
 These fortifications were, indeed, impregnable to the assaults of art or violence; and when <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> invested the capital, he was soon convinced that famine only could tame the stubborn spirit of the Barbarians.
 The sea, the land, and the channels of the Po, were guarded by the vigilance of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general; and his morality extended the rights of war to the practice of poisoning the waters, (105) and secretly firing the granaries (106) of a besieged city.
 (107) While he pressed the blockade of Ravenna, he was surprised by the arrival of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors from Constantinople, with a treaty of peace, which <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> had imprudently signed, without deigning to consult the author of his victory.
 By this disgraceful and precarious agreement, <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasure were divided, and the provinces beyond the <PERSON>Po</PERSON> were left with the regal title to the successor of Theodoric.
 The ambassadors were eager to accomplish their salutary commission; the captive <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> accepted, with transport, the unexpected offer of a crown; honour was less prevalent among the Goths, than the want and appetite of food; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> chiefs, who murmured at the continuance of the war, professed implicit submission to the commands of the emperor.
 If <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> had possessed only the courage of a soldier, the laurel would have been snatched from his hand by timid and envious counsels; but in this decisive moment, he resolved, with the magnanimity of a statesman, to sustain alone the danger and merit of generous disobedience.
 Each of his officers gave a written opinion that the siege of <PERSON>Ravenna</PERSON> was impracticable and hopeless: the general then rejected the treaty of partition, and declared his own resolution of leading <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> in chains to the feet of Justinian.
 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired with doubt and dismay: this peremptory refusal deprived them of the only signature which they could trust, and filled their minds with a just apprehension, that a sagacious enemy had discovered the full extent of their deplorable state.
 They compared the fame and fortune of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> with the weakness of their ill-fated king; and the comparison suggested an extraordinary project, to which Vitiges, with apparent resignation, was compelled to acquiesce.
 Partition would ruin the strength, exile would disgrace the honour, of the nation; but they offered their arms, their treasures, and the fortifications of Ravenna, if <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> would disclaim the authority of a master, accept the choice of the Goths, and assume, as he had deserved, the kingdom of Italy.
 If the false lustre of a diadem could have tempted the loyalty of a faithful subject, his prudence must have foreseen the inconstancy of the Barbarians, and his rational ambition would prefer the safe and honourable station of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general.
 Even the patience and seeming satisfaction with which he entertained a proposal of treason, might be susceptible of a malignant interpretation.
 But the lieutenant of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was conscious of his own rectitude; he entered into a dark and crooked path, as it might lead to the voluntary submission of the Goths; and his dexterous policy persuaded them that he was disposed to comply with their wishes, without engaging an oath or a promise for the performance of a treaty which he secretly abhorred.
 The day of the surrender of <PERSON>Ravenna</PERSON> was stipulated by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> ambassadors: a fleet, laden with provisions, sailed as a welcome guest into the deepest recess of the harbour: subdues the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kingdom 0f Italy, A.
D.
 539, December.
 the gates were opened to the fancied king of Italy; and Belisarius, without meeting an enemy, triumphantly marched through the streets of an impregnable city.
 (108) The <NORP>Romans</NORP> were astonished by their success; the multitudes of tall and robust <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were confounded by the image of their own patience and the masculine females, spitting in the faces of their sons and husbands, most bitterly reproached them for betraying their dominion and freedom to these pygmies of the south, contemptible in their numbers, diminutive in their stature.
 Before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> could recover from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> surprise, and claim the accomplishment of their doubtful hopes, the victor established his power in Ravenna, beyond the danger of repentance and revolt.
 Captivity of Vitiges.
 Vitiges, who perhaps had attempted to escape, was honorably guarded in his palace; (109) the flower of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> youth was selected for the service of the emperor; the remainder of the people was dismissed to their peaceful habitations in the southern provinces; and a colony of <NORP>Italians</NORP> was invited to replenish the depopulated city.
 The submission of the capital was imitated in the towns and villages of Italy, which had not been subdued, or even visited, by the Romans; and the independent Goths, who remained in arms at <GPE>Pavia</GPE> and Verona, were ambitious only to become the subjects of Belisarius.
 But his inflexible loyalty rejected, except as the substitute of Justinian, their oaths of allegiance; and he was not offended by the reproach of their deputies, that he rather chose to be a slave than a king.
 Return and glory of Belisarius, A.
D.
 540 etc.
 After the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> victory of Belisarius, envy again whispered, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> listened, and the hero was recalled.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> understood the suspicion, accepted the excuse, embarked at <PERSON>Ravenna</PERSON> his spoils and trophies; and proved, by his ready obedience, that such an abrupt removal from the government of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was not less unjust than it might have been indiscreet.
 The emperor received with honourable courtesy both <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> and his more noble consort; and as the king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> conformed to the <NORP>Athanasian</NORP> faith, he obtained, with a rich inheritance of land in Asia, the rank of senator and patrician.
 (110) Every spectator admired, without peril, the strength and stature of the young Barbarians: they adored the majesty of the throne, and promised to shed their blood in the service of their benefactor.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> deposited in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace the treasures of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> monarchy.
 A flattering senate was sometime admitted to gaze on the magnificent spectacle; but it was enviously secluded from the public view: and the conqueror of <GPE>Italy</GPE> renounced, without a murmur, perhaps without a sigh, the well-earned honours of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> triumph.
 His glory was indeed exalted above all external pomp; and the faint and hollow praises of the court were supplied, even in a servile age, by the respect and admiration of his country.
 Whenever he appeared in the streets and public places of Constantinople, <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> attracted and satisfied the eyes of the people.
 His lofty stature and majestic countenance fulfilled their expectations of a hero; the meanest of his fellow-citizens were emboldened by his gentle and gracious demeanor; and the martial train which attended his footsteps left his person more accessible than in a day of battle.
 Seven <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horsemen, matchless for beauty and valour, were maintained in the service, and at the private expense, of the general.
 (111) Their prowess was always conspicuous in single combats, or in the foremost ranks; and both parties confessed that in the siege of Rome, the guards of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> had alone vanquished the <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> host.
 Their numbers were continually augmented by the bravest and most faithful of the enemy; and his fortunate captives, the Vandals, the Moors, and the Goths, emulated the attachment of his domestic followers.
 By the union of liberality and justice, he acquired the love of the soldiers, without alienating the affections of the people.
 The sick and wounded were relieved with medicines and money; and still more efficaciously, by the healing visits and smiles of their commander.
 The loss of a weapon or a horse was instantly repaired, and each deed of valour was rewarded by the rich and honourable gifts of a bracelet or a collar, which were rendered more precious by the judgment of Belisarius.
 He was endeared to the husbandmen by the peace and plenty which they enjoyed under the shadow of his standard.
 Instead of being injured, the country was enriched by the march of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies; and such was the rigid discipline of their camp, that not an apple was gathered from the tree, not a path could be traced in the fields of corn.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was chaste and sober.
 In the license of a military life, none could boast that they had seen him intoxicated with wine: the most beautiful captives of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> or <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> race were offered to his embraces; but he turned aside from their charms, and the husband of <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> was never suspected of violating the laws of conjugal fidelity.
 The spectator and historian of his exploits has observed, that amidst the perils of war, he was daring without rashness, prudent without fear, slow or rapid according to the exigencies of the moment; that in the deepest distress he was animated by real or apparent hope, but that he was modest and humble in the most prosperous fortune.
 By these virtues, he equalled or excelled the ancient masters of the military art.
 Victory, by sea and land, attended his arms.
 He subdued Africa, Italy, and the adjacent islands; led away captives the successors of <NORP>Genseric</NORP> and Theodoric; filled <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with the spoils of their palaces; and in the space of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years recovered <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> the provinces of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 In his fame and merit, in wealth and power, he remained without a rival, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> subjects; the voice of envy could only magnify his dangerous importance; and the emperor might applaud his own discerning spirit, which had discovered and raised the genius of Belisarius.
 Secret history of his wife Antonina.
 It was the custom of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> triumphs, that a slave should be placed behind the chariot to remind the conqueror of the instability of fortune, and the infirmities of human nature.
 Procopius, in his Anecdotes, has assumed that servile and ungrateful office.
 The generous reader may cast away the libel, but the evidence of facts will adhere to his memory; and he will reluctantly confess, that the fame, and even the virtue, of Belisarius, were polluted by the lust and cruelty of his wife; and that hero deserved an appellation which may not drop from the pen of the decent historian.
 The mother of <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> (112) was a theatrical prostitute, and both her father and grandfather exercised, at <GPE>Thessalonica</GPE> and Constantinople, the vile, though lucrative, profession of charioteers.
 In the various situations of their fortune she became the companion, the enemy, the servant, and the favorite of the empress Theodora: these loose and ambitious females had been connected by similar pleasures; they were separated by the jealousy of vice, and at length reconciled by the partnership of guilt.
 Before her marriage with Belisarius, <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> had <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> husband and many lovers: Photius, the son of her former nuptials, was of an age to distinguish himself at the siege of Naples; and it was not till the autumn of her age and beauty (113) that she indulged a scandalous attachment to a <NORP>Thracian</NORP> youth.
 Her lover Theodosius.
 <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> had been educated in the <NORP>Eunomian</NORP> heresy; the <NORP>African</NORP> voyage was consecrated by the baptism and auspicious name of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> soldier who embarked; and the proselyte was adopted into the family of his spiritual parents, (114) <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> and Antonina.
 Before they touched the shores of Africa, this holy kindred degenerated into sensual love: and as <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> soon overleaped the bounds of modesty and caution, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general was alone ignorant of his own dishonor.
 During their residence at Carthage, he surprised the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> lovers in a subterraneous chamber, solitary, warm, and almost naked.
 Anger flashed from his eyes.
 The youth resumed his garments, and the pious husband consented to disbelieve the evidence of his own senses.
 From this pleasing and perhaps voluntary delusion, <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was awakened at Syracuse, by the officious information of Macedonia; and that female attendant, after requiring an oath for her security, produced <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> chamberlains, who, like herself, had often beheld the adulteries of Antonina.
 A hasty flight into <LOC>Asia</LOC> saved <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> from the justice of an injured husband, who had signified to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his guards the order of his death; but the tears of Antonina, and her artful seductions, assured the credulous hero of her innocence: and he stooped, against his faith and judgment, to abandon those imprudent friends, who had presumed to accuse or doubt the chastity of his wife.
 The revenge of a guilty woman is implacable and bloody: the unfortunate Macedonia, with the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> witnesses, were secretly arrested by the minister of her cruelty; their tongues were cut out, their bodies were hacked into small pieces, and their remains were cast into the Sea of Syracuse.
 A rash though judicious saying of Constantine, "I would sooner have punished the adulteress than the boy," was deeply remembered by Antonina; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years afterwards, when despair had armed that officer against his general, her sanguinary advice decided and hastened his execution.
 Even the indignation of <PERSON>Photius</PERSON> was not forgiven by his mother; the exile of her son prepared the recall of her lover; and <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> condescended to accept the pressing and humble invitation of the conqueror of Italy.
 In the absolute direction of his household, and in the important commissions of peace and war, (115) the favorite youth most rapidly acquired a fortune of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling; and after their return to Constantinople, the passion of Antonina, at least, continued ardent and unabated.
 But fear, devotion, and lassitude perhaps, inspired <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> with more serious thoughts.
 He dreaded the busy scandal of the capital, and the indiscreet fondness of the wife of Belisarius; escaped from her embraces, and retiring to Ephesus, shaved his head, and took refuge in the sanctuary of a monastic life.
 The despair of the new <PERSON>Ariadne</PERSON> could scarcely have been excused by the death of her husband.
 She wept, she tore her hair, she filled the palace with her cries; "she had lost the dearest of friends, a tender, a faithful, a laborious friend!" But her warm entreaties, fortified by the prayers of Belisarius, were insufficient to draw the holy monk from the solitude of Ephesus.
 It was not till the general moved forward for the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war, that <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> could be tempted to return to Constantinople; and the short interval before the departure of <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> herself was boldly devoted to love and pleasure.
 Resentment of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> and her son Photius.
 A philosopher may pity and forgive the infirmities of female nature, from which he receives no real injury: but contemptible is the husband who feels, and yet endures, his own infamy in that of his wife.
 <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> pursued her son with implacable hatred; and the gallant <PERSON>Photius</PERSON> (116) was exposed to her secret persecutions in the camp beyond the Tigris.
 Enraged by his own wrongs, and by the dishonor of his blood, he cast away in his turn the sentiments of nature, and revealed to <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> the turpitude of a woman who had violated all the duties of a mother and a wife.
 From the surprise and indignation of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, his former credulity appears to have been sincere: he embraced the knees of the son of Antonina, adjured him to remember his obligations rather than his birth, and confirmed at the altar their holy vows of revenge and mutual defence.
 The dominion of <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> was impaired by absence; and when she met her husband, on his return from the <NORP>Persian</NORP> confines, Belisarius, in his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and transient emotions, confined her person, and threatened her life.
 <PERSON>Photius</PERSON> was more resolved to punish, and less prompt to pardon: he flew to Ephesus; extorted from a trusty eunuch of his another the full confession of her guilt; arrested <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> and his treasures in the church of St.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Apostle, and concealed his captives, whose execution was only delayed, in a secure and sequestered fortress of Cilicia.
 Such a daring outrage against public justice could not pass with impunity; and the cause of <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> was espoused by the empress, whose favour she had deserved by the recent services of the disgrace of a praefect, and the exile and murder of a pope.
 At the end of the campaign, <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was recalled; he complied, as usual, with the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> mandate.
 His mind was not prepared for rebellion: his obedience, however adverse to the dictates of honour, was consonant to the wishes of his heart; and when he embraced his wife, at the command, and perhaps in the presence, of the empress, the tender husband was disposed to forgive or to be forgiven.
 The bounty of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> reserved for her companion a more precious favour.
 As soon as the curiosity and impatience of <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> were kindled, the door of a bed-chamber was thrown open, and she beheld her lover, whom the diligence of the eunuchs had discovered in his secret prison.
 Her silent wonder burst into passionate exclamations of gratitude and joy, and she named <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> her queen, her benefactress, and her savior.
 The monk of <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> was nourished in the palace with luxury and ambition; but instead of assuming, as he was promised, the command of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies, <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> expired in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fatigues of an amorous interview.
 The grief of <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> could only be assuaged by the sufferings of her son.
 Persecution of her son.
 A youth of consular rank, and a sickly constitution, was punished, without a trial, like a malefactor and a slave: yet such was the constancy of his mind, that <PERSON>Photius</PERSON> sustained the tortures of the scourge and the rack, ! without violating the faith which he had sworn to Belisarius.
 After this fruitless cruelty, the son of Antonina, while his mother feasted with the empress, was buried in her subterraneous prisons, which admitted not the distinction of night and day.
 He twice escaped to the most venerable sanctuaries of Constantinople, the churches of St.
 Sophia, and of the Virgin: but his tyrants were insensible of religion as of pity; and the helpless youth, amidst the clamours of the clergy and people, was twice dragged from the altar to the dungeon.
 His <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> attempt was more successful.
 At the end of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the prophet Zachariah, or some mortal friend, indicated the means of an escape: he eluded the spies and guards of the empress, reached the holy sepulchre of Jerusalem, embraced the profession of a monk; and the abbot <PERSON>Photius</PERSON> was employed, after the death of Justinian, to reconcile and regulate the churches of Egypt.
 The son of <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> suffered all that an enemy can inflict: her patient husband imposed on himself the more exquisite misery of violating his promise and deserting his friend.
 Disgrace and submission of Belisarius.
 In the succeeding campaign, <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was again sent against the Persians: he saved the East, but he offended Theodora, and perhaps the emperor himself.
 The malady of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> had countenanced the rumor of his death; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, on the supposition of that probable event spoke the free language of a citizen and a soldier.
 His colleague Buzes, who concurred in the same sentiments, lost his rank, his liberty, and his health, by the persecution of the empress: but the disgrace of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was alleviated by the dignity of his own character, and the influence of his wife, who might wish to humble, but could not desire to ruin, the partner of her fortunes.
 Even his removal was colored by the assurance, that the sinking state of <GPE>Italy</GPE> would be retrieved by the single presence of its conqueror.
 But no sooner had he returned, alone and defenceless, than a hostile commission was sent to the East, to seize his treasures and criminate his actions; the guards and veterans, who followed his private banner, were distributed among the chiefs of the army, and even the eunuchs presumed to cast lots for the partition of his martial domestics.
 When he passed with a small and sordid retinue through the streets of Constantinople, his forlorn appearance excited the amazement and compassion of the people.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> received him with cold ingratitude; the servile crowd, with insolence and contempt; and in the <TIME>evening</TIME> he retired with trembling steps to his deserted palace.
 An indisposition, feigned or real, had confined <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> to her apartment; and she walked disdainfully silent in the adjacent portico, while <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> threw himself on his bed, and expected, in an agony of grief and terror, the death which he had so often braved under the walls of Rome.
 Long after sunset a messenger was announced from the empress: he opened, with anxious curiosity, the letter which contained the sentence of his fate.
 I know not how to believe or to relate the transports with which the hero is said to have received this ignominious pardon.
 He fell prostrate before his wife, he kissed the feet of his saviour, and he devoutly promised to live the grateful and submissive slave of Antonina.
 A fine of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and twenty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling was levied on the fortunes of Belisarius; and with the office of count, or master of the royal stables, he accepted the conduct of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> war.
 At his departure from Constantinople, his friends, and even the public, were persuaded that as soon as he regained his freedom, he would renounce his dissimulation, and that his wife, Theodora, and perhaps the emperor himself, would be sacrificed to the just revenge of a virtuous rebel.
 Their hopes were deceived; and the unconquerable patience and loyalty of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> appear either below or above the character of a MAN.
 (117)
