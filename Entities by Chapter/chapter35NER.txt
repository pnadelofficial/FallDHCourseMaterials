Attila threatens both empires, and prepares to invade Gaul, A.
D.
 450.
 IT was the opinion of Marcian, that war should be avoided as long as it is possible to preserve a secure and honourable peace; but it was likewise his opinion that peace cannot be honourable or secure, if the sovereign betrays a pusillanimous aversion to war.
 This temperate courage dictated his reply to the demands of Attila, who insolently pressed the payment of the <DATE>annual</DATE> tribute.
 The emperor signified to the barbarians that they must no longer insult the majesty of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the mention of a tribute; that he was disposed to reward, with becoming liberality, the faithful friendship of his allies; but that, if they presumed to violate the public peace, they should feel that he possessed troops, and arms, and resolution, to repel their attacks.
 The same language, even in the camp of the Huns, was used by his ambassador Apollonius, whose bold refusal to deliver the presents, till he had been admitted to a personal interview, displayed a sense of dignity, and a contempt of danger, which <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> was not prepared to expect from the degenerate Romans.
(1) He threatened to chastise the rash successor of Theodosius; but he hesitated, whether he should <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> direct his invincible arms against the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> or the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 While mankind awaited his decision with awful suspense, he sent an equal defiance to the courts of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Constantinople; and his ministers saluted the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors with the same haughty declaration.
 "Attila, my lord, and thy lord, commands thee to provide a palace for his immediate reception.
" (2) But as the barbarian despised, or affected to despise, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> of the East, whom he had so often vanquished, he soon declared his resolution of suspending the easy conquest till he had achieved a more glorious and important enterprise.
 In the memorable invasions of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> and Italy, the <NORP>Huns</NORP> were naturally attracted by the wealth and fertility of those provinces; but the particular motives and provocations of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> can only be explained by the state of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of Valentinian, or, to speak more correctly, under the administration of Aetius.
 (3) Character and administration of Aetius, A.
D.
 433-454.
 After the death of his rival Boniface, <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> had prudently retired to the tents of the Huns; and he was indebted to their alliance for his safety and his restoration.
 Instead of the suppliant language of a guilty exile, he solicited his pardon at the head of sixty thousand barbarians; and the empress <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> confessed, by a feeble resistance, that the condescension which might have been ascribed to clemency was the effect of weakness or fear.
 She delivered herself, her son Valentinian, and the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, into the hands of an insolent subject; nor could <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> protect the son-in-law of Boniface, the virtuous and faithful Sebastian, (4) from the implacable persecution which urged him from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> kingdom to another, till he miserably perished in the service of the Vandals.
 The fortunate Aetius, who was immediately promoted to the rank of patrician, and thrice invested with the honours of the consulship, assumed, with the title of master of the cavalry and infantry, the whole military power of the state; and he is sometimes styled, by contemporary writers, the duke, or general, of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> of the West.
 His prudence, rather than his virtue, engaged him to leave the grandson of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> in the possession of the purple; and <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was permitted to enjoy the peace and luxury of Italy, while the patrician appeared in the glorious light of a hero and a patriot, who supported near twenty years the ruins of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> historian ingenuously confesses that <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> was born for the salvation of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic; (5) and the following portrait, though it is drawn in the fairest colours, must be allowed to contain a much larger proportion of truth than of flattery.
 The barbarians, who had seated themselves in the <NORP>Western</NORP> provinces, were insensibly taught to respect the faith and valour of the patrician Aetius.
 He soothed their passions, consulted their prejudices, balanced their interest, and checked their ambition.
 A seasonable treaty which he concluded with <EVENT>Genseric</EVENT> protected <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the depredations of the Vandals; the independent <NORP>Britons</NORP> implored and acknowledged his salutary aid; the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> authority was restored and maintained in <LOC>Gaul</LOC> and Spain; and he compelled the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and the Suevi, whom he had vanquished in the field, to become the useful confederates of the republic.
 His connection with the <NORP>Huns</NORP> and Alani.
 From a principle of interest, as well as gratitude, <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> assiduously cultivated the alliance of the Huns.
 While he resided in their tents as an hostage or an exile, he had familiarly conversed with <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> himself, the nephew of his benefactor; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> famous antagonists appear to have been connected by a personal and military friendship, which they afterwards confirmed by mutual gifts, frequent embassies, and the education of Carpilio, the son of Aetius, in the camp of Attila.
 By the specious professions of gratitude and voluntary attachment, the patrician might disguise his apprehensions of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> conqueror, who pressed the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires with his innumerable armies.
 His demands were obeyed or eluded.
 When he claimed the spoils of a vanquished city, some vases of gold, which had been fraudulently embezzled, the civil and military governors of <GPE>Noricum</GPE> were immediately despatched to satisfy his complaints:(7) and it is evident, from their conversation with <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Priscus</PERSON> in the royal village, that the valour and prudence of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> had not saved the <NORP>Western</NORP> <NORP>Romans</NORP> from the common ignominy of tribute.
 Yet his dexterous policy prolonged the advantages of a salutary peace; and a numerous army of <NORP>Huns</NORP> and Alani, whom he had attached to his person, was employed in the defence of Gaul.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> colonies of these barbarians were judiciously fixed in the territories of <LOC>Valence</LOC> and Orleans;(8) and their active cavalry secured the important passages of the <PERSON>Rhine</PERSON> and of the Loire.
 These savage allies were not indeed less formidable to the subjects than to the enemies of Rome.
 Their original settlement was enforced with the licentious violence of conquest; and the province through which they marched was exposed to all the calamities of an hostile invasion.
(9) Strangers to the emperor or the republic, the <NORP>Alani</NORP> of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> were devoted to the ambition of Aetius; and though he might suspect that, in a contest with <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> himself, they would revolt to the standard of their national king, the patrician laboured to restrain, rather than to excite, their zeal and resentment against the Goths, the Burgundians, and the Franks.
 The <PERSON>Visigoths</PERSON> in <LOC>Gaul</LOC> under the reign of Theoderic, A.
D.
 419-451.
 The kingdom established by the <PERSON>Visigoths</PERSON> in the southern provinces of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> had gradually acquired strength and maturity; and the conduct of those ambitious barbarians, either in peace or war, engaged the perpetual vigilance of Aetius.
 After the death of Wallia, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre devolved to Theodoric, the son of the great Alaric;(10) and his prosperous reign of more than thirty years over a turbulent people may be allowed to prove that his prudence was supported by uncommon vigour, both of mind and body.
 Impatient of his narrow limits, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> aspired to the possession of Arles, the wealthy seat of government and commerce; but the city was saved by the timely approach of Aetius; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who had raised the siege with some loss and disgrace, was persuaded, for an adequate subsidy, to divert the martial valour of his subjects in a Spanish war.
 Yet <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> still watched, and eagerly seized, the favourable moment of renewing his hostile attempts.
 A.
D.
 435-439.
 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> besieged Narbonne, while the <NORP>Belgic</NORP> provinces were invaded by the Burgundians; and the public safety was threatened on every side by the apparent union of the enemies of Rome.
 On every side, the activity of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> and his <NORP>Scythian</NORP> cavalry opposed a firm and successful resistance.
 Twenty thousand <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> were slain in battle, and the remains of the nation humbly accepted a ependent seat in the mountains of Savoy.
(11) The walls of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> had been shaken by the battering engines, and the inhabitants had endured the last extremities of famine, when Count Litorius, approaching in silence, and directing each horseman to carry behind him <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sacks of flour, cut his way through the entrenchments of the besiegers.
 The siege was immediately raised; and the more decisive victory, which is ascribed to the personal conduct of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> himself, was marked with the blood of eight thousand Goths.
 But in the absence of the patrician, who was hastily summoned to <GPE>Italy</GPE> by some public or private interest, Count <PERSON>Litorius</PERSON> succeeded to the command; and his presumption soon discovered that far different talents are required to lead a wing of cavalry, or to direct the operations of an important war.
 At the head of an army of Huns, he rashly advanced to the gates of Toulouse, full of careless contempt for an enemy whom his misfortunes had rendered prudent, and his situation made desperate.
 The predictions of the augurs had inspired <PERSON>Litorius</PERSON> with the profane confidence that he should enter the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> capital in triumph; and the trust which he reposed in his <NORP>Pagan</NORP> allies encouraged him to reject the fair conditions of peace which were repeatedly proposed by the bishops in the name of Theodoric.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> exhibited in his distress the edifying contrast of <NORP>Christian</NORP> piety and moderation; nor did he lay aside his sackcloth and ashes till he was prepared to arm for the combat.
 His soldiers, animated with martial and religious enthusiasm, assaulted the camp of Litorius.
 The conflict was obstinate; the slaughter was mutual.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, after a total defeat, which could be imputed only to his unskilful rashness, was actually led through the streets of Toulouse, not in his own, but in an hostile triumph; and the misery which he experienced, in a long and ignominious captivity, excited the compassion of the barbarians themselves.
(12) Such a loss, in a country whose spirit and finances were long since exhausted, could not easily be repaired; and the Goths, assuming, in their turn, the sentiments of ambition and revenge, would have planted their victorious standards on the banks of the Rhone, if the presence of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> had not restored strength and discipline to the Romans.
(13) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies expected the signal of a decisive action; but the generals, who were conscious of each other's force, and doubtful of their own superiority, prudently sheathed their swords in the field of battle; and their reconciliation was permanent and sincere.
 Theodoric; king of the Visigoths, appears to have deserved the love of his subjects, the confidence of his allies, and the esteem of mankind.
 His throne was surrounded by <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> valiant sons, who were educated with equal care in the exercises of the barbarian camp, and in those of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> schools: from the study of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence they acquired the theory, at least, of law and justice; and the harmonious sense of <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> contributed to soften the asperity of their native manners.
 (14) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> daughters of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king were given in marriage to the eldest sons of the kings of the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and of the Vandals, who reigned in <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Africa; but these illustrious alliances were pregnant with guilt and discord.
 The queen of the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> bewailed the death of an husband, inhumanly massacred by her brother.
 The princess of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> was the victim of a jealous tyrant, whom she called her father.
 The cruel <EVENT>Genseric</EVENT> suspected that his son's wife had conspired to poison him; the supposed crime was punished by the amputation of her nose and ears; and the unhappy daughter of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> was ignominiously returned to the court of <GPE>Toulouse</GPE> in that deformed and mutilated condition.
 This horrid act, which must seem incredible to a civilised age, drew tears from every spectator; but <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> was urged, by the feelings of a parent and a king, to revenge such irreparable injuries.
 The <ORG>Imperial</ORG> ministers, who always cherished the discord of the barbarians, would have supplied the <NORP>Goths</NORP> with arms, and ships, and treasures, for the African war; and the cruelty of <EVENT>Genseric</EVENT> might have been fatal to himself, if the artful <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> had not armed, in his cause, the formidable power of the Huns.
 His rich gifts and pressing solicitations inflamed the ambition of Attila; and the designs of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> were prevented by the invasion of Gaul.
(15) The <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> in Gaul, under the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> kings, A.
D.
 420-451.
 The Franks, whose monarchy was still confined to the neighbourhood of the Lower Rhine, had wisely established the right of hereditary succession in the noble family of the Merovingians.
(16) These princes were elevated on a buckler, the symbol of military command;(17) and the royal fashion of long hair was the ensign of their birth and dignity.
 Their flaxen locks, which they combed and dressed with singular care, hung down in flowing ringlets on their back and shoulders; while the rest of the nation were obliged, either by law or custom, to shave the hinder part of their head, to comb their hair over the forehead, and to content themselves with the ornament of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> small whiskers.
 (18) The lofty stature of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and their blue eyes denoted a <NORP>Germanic</NORP> origin; their close apparel accurately expressed the figure of their limbs; a weighty sword was suspended from a broad belt; their bodies were protected by a large shield: and these warlike barbarians were trained from their earliest youth to run, to leap, to swim; to dart the javelin or battle-axe with unerring aim; to advance without hesitation against a superior enemy; and to maintain, either in life or death, the invincible reputation of their ancestors.
 (19) Clodion, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of their long-haired kings whose name and actions are mentioned in authentic history, held his residence at Dispargum, (20) a village or fortress, whose place may be assigned between <GPE>Louvain</GPE> and Brussels.
 From the report of his spies the king of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> was informed that the defenceless state of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> <NORP>Belgic</NORP> must yield, on the slightest attack, to the valour of his subjects.
 He boldly penetrated through the thickets and morasses of the <NORP>Carbonarian</NORP> forest,(21) occupied <LOC>Tournay</LOC> and Cambray, the only cities which existed in the fifth century; and extended his conquests as far as the river Somme, over a desolate country whose cultivation and populousness are the effects of more recent industry.
 (22) While <PERSON>Clodion</PERSON> lay encamped in the plains of Artois, (23) and celebrated with vain and ostentatious security the marriage perhaps of his son, the nuptial feast was interrupted by the unexpected and unwelcome presence of Aetius, who had passed the <LOC>Somme</LOC> at the head of his light cavalry.
 The tables, which had been spread under the shelter of a hill along the banks of a pleasant stream, were rudely overturned; the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> were oppressed before they could recover their arms or their ranks, and their unavailing valour was fatal only to themselves.
 The loaded waggons which had followed their march afforded a rich booty; and the virgin-bride with her female attendants submitted to the new lovers who were imposed on them by the chance of war.
 This advantage, which had been obtained by the skill and activity of Aetius, might reflect some disgrace on the military prudence of Clodion; but the king of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> soon regained his strength and reputation, and still maintained the possession of his <NORP>Gallic</NORP> kingdom from the <PERSON>Rhine</PERSON> to the Somme.
(24) Under his reign, and most probably from the enterprising spirit of his subjects, the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> Capitals, Mentzs Treves, and Cologne, experienced the effects of hostile cruelty and avarice.
 The distress of <GPE>Cologne</GPE> was prolonged by the perpetual dominion of the same barbarians who evacuated the ruins of Treves, and Treves, which in the space of forty years had been <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> times besieged and pillaged, was disposed to lose the memory of her afflictions in the vain amusements of the circus.
(25) The death of Clodion, after a reign of twenty years, exposed his kingdom to the discord and ambition of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons.
 Meroveus, the younger, (26) was persuaded to implore the protection of Rome; he was received at the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court as the ally of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> and the adopted son of the patrician Aetius, and dismissed to his native country with splendid gifts and the strongest assurances of friendship and support.
 During his absence his elder brother had solicited with equal ardour the formidable aid of Attila; and the king of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> embraced an alliance which facilitated the passage of the Rhine, and justified by a specious and honourable pretence the invasion of Gaul.
(27) The adventures of the princess Honoria.
 When <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> declared his resolution of supporting the cause of his allies the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> and the Franks, at the same time, and almost in the spirit of romantic chivalry, the savage monarch professed himself the lover and the champion of the princess Honoria.
 The sister of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was educated in the palace of Ravenna; and as her marriage might be productive of some danger to the state, she was raised, by the title of Augusta, (28) above the hopes of the most presumptuous subject.
 But the fair <PERSON>Honoria</PERSON> had no sooner attained the sixteenth year of her age than she detested the importunate greatness which must for ever exclude her from the comforts of honourable love: in the midst of vain and unsatisfactory pomp <PERSON>Honoria</PERSON> sighed, yielded to the impulse of nature, and threw herself into the arms of her chamberlain Eugenius.
 Her guilt and shame (such is the absurd language of imperious man) were soon betrayed by the appearances of pregnancy: but the disgrace of the royal family was published to the world by the imprudence of the empress Placidia, who dismissed her daughter, after a strict and shameful confinement, to a remote exile at Constantinople.
 The unhappy princess passed <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> or fourteen years in the irksome society of the sisters of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> and their chosen virgins, to whose crown <PERSON>Honoria</PERSON> could no longer aspire, and whose monastic assiduity of prayer, fasting, and vigils she reluctantly imitated.
 Her impatience of long and hopeless celibacy urged her to embrace a strange and desperate resolution.
 The name of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> was familiar and formidable at Constantinople, and his frequent embassies entertained a perpetual intercourse between his camp and the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> palace.
 In the pursuit of love, or rather of revenge, the daughter of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> sacrificed every duty and every prejudice, and offered to deliver her person into the arms of a barbarian of whose language she was ignorant, whose figure was scarcely human, and whose religion and manners she abhorred.
 By the ministry of a faithful eunuch she transmitted to <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> a ring, the pledge of her affection, and earnestly conjured him to claim her as a lawful spouse to whom he had been secretly betrothed.
 These indecent advances were received, however, with coldness and disdain; and the king of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> continued to multiply the number of his wives till his love was awakened by the more forcible passions of ambition and avarice.
 The invasion of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> was preceded and justified by a formal demand of the princess Honoria, with a just and equal share of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> patrimony.
 His predecessors, the ancient Tanjous, had often addressed in the same hostile and peremptory manner the daughters of China; and the pretensions of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> were not less offensive to the majesty of Rome.
 A firm but temperate refusal was communicated to his ambassadors.
 The right of female succession, though it might derive a specious argument from the recent examples of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> and Pulcheria, was strenuously denied, and the indissoluble engagements of <PERSON>Honoria</PERSON> were opposed to the claims of her <NORP>Scythian</NORP> lover.
 (29) On the discovery of her connection with the king of the Huns, the guilty princess had been sent away, as an object of horror, from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to Italy: her life was spared, but the ceremony of her marriage was performed with some obscure and nominal husband before she was immured in a perpetual prison, to bewail those crimes and misfortunes which <PERSON>Honoria</PERSON> might have escaped had she not been born the daughter of an emperor.
(30) <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> invades Gaul, and besieges Orleans, A.
D.
 4501.
 A native of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> and a contemporary, the learned and eloquent Sidonius, who was afterwards bishop of Clermont, had made a promise to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his friends that he would compose a regular history of the war of Attila.
 If the modesty of <PERSON>Sidonius</PERSON> had not discouraged him from the prosecution of this interesting work,(31) the historian could have related with the simplicity of truth those memorable events to which the poet, in vague and doubtful metaphors, has concisely alluded.
 (32) The kings and nations of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia, from the <LOC>Volga</LOC> perhaps to the Danube, obeyed the warlike summons of Attila.
 From the royal village in the plains of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> his standard moved towards the <LOC>West</LOC> and after a march of seven or eight <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles he reached the conflux of the <PERSON>Rhine</PERSON> and the Neckar, where he was joined by the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who adhered to his ally, the elder of the sons of Clodion.
 A troop of light barbarians who roamed in quest of plunder might choose the winter for the convenience of passing the river on the ice, but the innumerable cavalry of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> required such plenty of forage and provisions as could be procured only in a milder season; the <NORP>Hercynian</NORP> forest supplied materials for a bridge of boats, and the hostile myriads were poured with resistless violence into the <NORP>Belgic</NORP> provinces.
 (33) The consternation of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> was universal, and the various fortunes of its cities have been adorned by tradition with martyrdoms and miracles.
(34) <WORK_OF_ART>Troyes</WORK_OF_ART> was saved by the merits of St.
 Lupus; St.
 Servatius was removed from the world that he might not behold the ruin of Tongres; and the prayers of St.
 Genevieve diverted the march of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> from the neighbourhood of Paris.
 But as the greatest part of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> cities were alike destitute of saints and soldiers, they were besieged and stormed by the Huns, who practised, in the example of Metz, (35) their customary maxims of war.
 They involved in a promiscuous massacre the priests who served at the altar and the infants who, in the hour of danger, had been providently baptised by the bishop; the flourishing city was delivered to the flames, and a solitary chapel of St.
 Stephen marked the place where it formerly stood.
 From the <PERSON>Rhine</PERSON> and the Moselle, <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> advanced into the heart of Gaul, crossed the <LOC>Seine</LOC> at Auxerre, and after a long and laborious march fixed his camp under the walls of Orleans.
 He was desirous of securing his conquests by the possession of an advantageous post which commanded the passage of the Loire; and he depended on the secret invitation of Sangiban, king of the Alani, who had promised to betray the city and to revolt from the service of the empire.
 But this treacherous conspiracy was detected and disappointed: <GPE>Orleans</GPE> had been strengthened with recent fortifications, and the assaults of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> were vigorously repelled by the faithful valour of the soldiers or citizens who defended the place.
 The pastoral diligence of Anianus, a bishop of primitive sanctity and consummate prudence, exhausted every art of religious policy to support their courage till the arrival of the expected succours.
 After an obstinate siege the walls were shaken by the battering rams; the <NORP>Huns</NORP> had already occupied the suburbs, and the people who were incapable of bearing arms lay prostrate in prayer.
 Anianus, who anxiously counted the days and hours! despatched a trusty messenger to observe from the rampart the face of the distant country.
 He returned twice without any intelligence that could inspire hope or comfort; but in his <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> report he mentioned a small cloud which he had faintly descried at the extremity of the horizon.
 "It is the aid of God!" exclaimed the bishop in a tone of pious confidence; and the whole multitude repeated after him "It is the aid of God.
" The remote object, on which every eye was fixed, became each moment larger and more distinct; the <NORP>Roman</NORP> and <NORP>Gothic</NORP> banners were gradually perceived; and a favourable wind, blowing aside the dust, discovered.
 in deep array, the impatient squadrons of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> and Theodoric, who pressed forwards to the relief of Orleans.
 Alliance of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and Visigoths.
 The facility with which <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> had penetrated into the heart of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> may be ascribed to his insidious policy as well as to the terror of his arms.
 His public declarations were skilfully mitigated by his private assurances; he alternately soothed and threatened the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Goths; and the courts of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Toulouse, mutually suspicious of each other's intentions, beheld with supine indifference the approach of their common enemy.
 <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> was the sole guardian of the public safety; but his wisest measures were embarrassed by a faction which, since the death of Placidia, infested the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> palace: the youth of <GPE>Italy</GPE> trembled at the sound of the trumpet; and the barbarians, who from fear or affection were inclined to the cause of Attila, awaited with doubtful and venal faith the event of the war.
 The patrician passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> at the head of some troops whose strength and numbers scarcely deserved the name of an army.
 (36) But on his arrival at <GPE>Arles</GPE> or <PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> he was confounded by the intelligence that the Visigoths, refusing to embrace the defence of Gaul, had determined to expect within their own territories the formidable invader whom they professed to despise.
 The senator Avitus, who after the honourable exercise of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefecture had retired to his estate in Auvergne, was persuaded to accept the important embassy, which he executed with ability and success.
 He represented to <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> that an ambitious conqueror who aspired to the dominion of the earth could be resisted only by the firm and unanimous alliance of the powers whom he laboured to oppress.
 The lively eloquence of <PERSON>Avitus</PERSON> inflamed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> warriors by the description of the injuries which their ancestors had suffered from the Huns, whose implacable fury still pursued them from the <PRODUCT>Dawe</PRODUCT> to the foot of the Pyrenees.
 He strenuously urged that it was the duty of every <NORP>Christian</NORP> to save from sacrilegious violation the churches of God and the relics of the saints; that it was the interest of every barbarian who had acquired a settlement in <LOC>Gaul</LOC> to defend the fields and vineyards, which were cultivated for his use, against the desolation of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> shepherds.
 <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> yielded to the evidence of truth, adopted the measure at once the most prudent and the most honourable, and declared that as the faithful ally of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> he was ready to expose his life and kingdom for the common safety of Gaul.
(37) The Visigoths, who at that time were in the mature vigour of their fame and power, obeyed with alacrity the signal of war, prepared their arms and horses, and assembled under the standard of their aged king, who was resolved, with his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> eldest sons, <PERSON>Torismond</PERSON> and Theodoric, to command in person his numerous and valiant people.
 The example of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> determined several tribes or nations that seemed to fluctuate between the <NORP>Huns</NORP> and the Romans.
 The indefatigable diligence of the patrician gradually collected the troops of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> and Germany, who had formerly acknowledged themselves the subjects or soldiers of the republic, but who now claimed the rewards of voluntary service and the rank of independent allies; the Laeti, the Armoricans, the Breones, the Saxons, the Burgundians, the <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> or Alani, the Ripuarians, and the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who followed <PERSON>Meroveus</PERSON> as their lawful prince.
 Such was the various army which, under the conduct of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> and Theodoric, advanced by rapid marches to relieve Orleans, and to give battle to the innumerable host of Attila.
(38) <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> retires to the plains of Champagne.
 On their approach the king of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> immediately raised the siege, and sounded a retreat to recall the foremost of his troops from the pillage of a city which they had already entered.
(39) The valour of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> was always guided by his prudence; and as he foresaw the fatal consequences of a defeat in the heart of Gaul, he repassed the Seine, and expected the enemy in the plains of Chalons, whose smooth and level surface was adapted to the operations of his <NORP>Scythian</NORP> cavalry.
 But in this tumultuary retreat the vanguard of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and their allies continually pressed, and sometimes engaged, the troops whom <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> had posted in the rear; the hostile columns, in the darkness of the night and the perplexity of the roads, might encounter each other without design; and the bloody conflict of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Gepidae, in which fifteen thousand(40) barbarians were slain, was a prelude to a more general and decisive action.
 The <NORP>Catalaunian</NORP> fields(41) spread themselves round Chalons, and extend, according to the vague measurement of Jornandes, to the length of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty, and the breadth of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles, over the whole province, which is entitled to the appellation of a 'champaign' country.
 (42) This spacious plain was distinguished, however, by some inequalities of ground; and the importance of an height which commanded the camp of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> was understood and disputed by the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals.
 The young and valiant <PERSON>Torismond</PERSON> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> occupied the summit; the <NORP>Goths</NORP> rushed with irresistible weight on the Huns, who laboured to ascend from the opposite side: and the possession of this advantageous post inspired both the troops and their leaders with a fair assurance of victory.
 The anxiety of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> prompted him to consult his priests and haruspices.
 It was reported that, after scrutinising the entrails of victims and scraping their bones, they revealed, in mysterious language, his own defeat, with the death of his principal adversary; and that the barbarian, by accepting the equivalent, expressed his involuntary esteem for the superior merit of Aetius.
 But the unusual despondency which seemed to prevail among the <NORP>Huns</NORP> engaged <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> to use the expedient, so familiar to the generals of antiquity, of animating his troops by a military oration; and his language was that of a king who had often fought and conquered at their head.
 (43) He pressed them to consider their past glory, their actual danger, and their future hopes.
 The same fortune which opened the deserts and morasses of <GPE>Scythia</GPE> to their unarmed valour, which had laid so many warlike nations prostrate at their feet, had reserved the joys of this memorable field for the consummation of their victories.
 The cautious steps of their enemies, their strict alliance, and their advantageous posts, he artfully represented as the effects, not of prudence, but of fear.
 The <PERSON>Visigoths</PERSON> alone were the strength and nerves of the opposite army, and the <NORP>Huns</NORP> might securely trample on the degenerate Romans, whose close and compact order betrayed their apprehensions, and who were equally incapable of supporting the dangers or the fatigues of a day of battle.
 The doctrine of predestination, so favourable to martial virtue, was carefully inculcated by the king of the Huns; who assured his subjects that the warriors, protected by Heaven, were safe and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy; but that the unerring <PERSON>Fates</PERSON> would strike their victims in the bosom of inglorious peace.
 The spirit of the barbarians was rekindled by the presence, the voice and the example of their intrepid leader and Attila, yielding to their impatience, immediately formed his order of battle.
 At the head of his brave and faithful Huns, he occupied in person the centre of the line.
 The nations subject to his empire, the Rugians, the Heruli, the Thuringians, the Franks, the Burgundians, were extended, on either hand, over the ample space of the <NORP>Catalaunian</NORP> fields; the right wing was commanded by Ardaric, king of the Gepidae; and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> valiant brothers who reigned over the <NORP>Ostrogoths</NORP> were posted on the left to oppose the kindred tribes of the Visigoths.
 The disposition of the allies was regulated by a different principle.
 Sangiban, the faithless king of the Alani, was placed in the centre: where his motions might be strictly watched, and his treachery might be instantly punished.
 <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> assumed the command of the left, and <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> of the right wing; while <PERSON>Torismond</PERSON> still continued to occupy the heights which appear to have stretched on the flank, and perhaps the rear, of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> army.
 The nations from the <LOC>Volga</LOC> to the <LOC>Atlantic</LOC> were assembled on the plain of Chalons; but many of these nations had been divided by faction, or conquest, or emigration; and the appearance of similar arms and ensigns, which threatened each other, presented the image of a civil war.
 Battle of Chalons.
 The discipline and tactics of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and <NORP>Romans</NORP> form an interesting part of their national manners.
 The attentive study of the military operations of Xenophon, or Caesar, or Frederic, when they are described by the same genius which conceived and executed them, may tend to improve (if such improvement can be wished) the art of destroying the human species.
 But the battle of <NORP>Chalons</NORP> can only excite our curiosity by the magnitude of the object; since it was decided by the blind impetuosity of barbarians, and has been related by partial writers, whose civil and ecclesiastical profession secluded them from the knowledge of military affairs.
 Cassiodorus, however, had familiarly conversed with many <NORP>Gothic</NORP> warriors who served in that memorable engagement; The number of the slain amounted to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-two thousand, or, according to another account, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand persons; (44) and these incredible exaggerations suppose a real and effective loss, sufficient to justify the historian's remark that whole generations may be swept away by the madness of kings in the space of a single hour.
 After the mutual and repeated discharge of missile weapons, in which the archers of <GPE>Scythia</GPE> might signalise their superior dexterity, the cavalry and infantry of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies were furiously mingled in closer combat.
 The Huns, who fought under the eyes of their king, pierced through the feeble and doubtful centre of the allies, separated their wings from each other, and wheeling, with a rapid effort, to the left, directed their whole force against the Visigoths.
 As <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> rode along the ranks to animate his troops, he received a mortal stroke from the javelin of Andaires, a noble Ostrogoth, and immediately fell from his horse.
 The wounded king was oppressed in the general disorder and trampled under the feet of his own cavalry; and this important death served to explain the ambiguous prophecy of the haruspices.
 <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> already exulted in the confidence of victory, when the valiant <PERSON>Torismond</PERSON> descended from the hills, and verified the remainder of the prediction.
 The Visigoths, who had been thrown into confusion by the flight, or defection, of the Alani, gradually restored their order of battle; and the <NORP>Huns</NORP> were undoubtedly vanquished, since <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> was compelled to retreat.
 He had exposed his person with the rashness of a private soldier, but the intrepid troops of the centre had pushed forwards beyond the rest of the line; their attack was faintly supported; their flanks were unguarded; and the conquerors of <GPE>Scythia</GPE> and <GPE>Germany</GPE> were saved by the approach of the night from a total defeat.
 They retired within the circle of wagons that fortified their camp; and the dismounted squadrons prepared themselves for a defence to which neither their arms or their temper were adapted.
 The event was doubtful but <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> had secured a last and honourable resource.
 The saddles and rich furniture of the cavalry were collected by his order into a funeral pile; and the magnanimous barbarian had resolved, if his entrenchments should be forced, to rush headlong into the flames, and deprive his enemies of the glory which they might have acquired by the death or captivity of Attila.
 (45) Retreat of Attila.
 But his enemies had passed the night in equal disorder and anxiety.
 The inconsiderate courage of <PERSON>Torismond</PERSON> was tempted to urge the pursuit, till he unexpectedly found himself, with a few followers, in the midst of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> waggons.
 In the confusion of a nocturnal combat he was thrown from his horse; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince must have perished like his father, if his youthful strength and the intrepid zeal of his companions had not rescued him from this dangerous situation.
 In the same manner, but on the left of the line, <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> himself, separated from his allies, ignorant of their victory, and anxious for their fate, encountered and escaped the hostile troops that were scattered over the plains of Chalons; and at length reached the camp of the Goths, which he could only fortify with a slight rampart of shields till the dawn of day.
 The <ORG>Imperial</ORG> general was soon satisfied of the defeat of Attila, who still remained inactive within his entrenchments; and when he contemplated the bloody scene, he observed, with secret satisfaction, that the loss had principally fallen on the barbarians.
 The body of Theodoric, pierced with honourable wounds, was discovered under a heap of the slain: his subjects bewailed the death of their king and father; but their tears were mingled with songs and acclamations, and his funeral rites were performed in the face of a vanquished enemy.
 The Goths, clashing their arms, elevated on a buckler his eldest son Torismond, to whom they justly ascribed the glory of their success; and the new king accepted the obligation of revenge as a sacred portion of his paternal inheritance.
 Yet the <NORP>Goths</NORP> themselves were astonished by the fierce and undaunted aspect of their formidable antagonist; and their historian has compared <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> to a lion encompassed in his den and threatening his hunters with redoubled fury.
 The kings and nations who might have deserted his standard in the hour of distress were made sensible that the displeasure of their monarch was the most imminent and inevitable danger.
 All his instruments of martial music incessantly sounded a loud and animating strain of defiance; and the foremost troops, who advanced to the assault, were checked or destroyed by showers of arrows from every side of the entrenchments.
 It was determined in a general council of war to besiege the king of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> in his camp, to intercept his provisions, and to reduce him to the alternative of a disgraceful treaty or an unequal combat.
 But the impatience of the barbarians soon disdained these cautious and dilatory measures: and the mature policy of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> was apprehensive that, after the extirpation of the Huns, the republic would be oppressed by the pride and power of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation.
 The patrician exerted the superior ascendant of authority and reason to calm the passions which the son of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> considered as a duty; represented, with seeming affection and real truth, the dangers of absence and delay; and persuaded <PERSON>Torismond</PERSON> to disappoint, by his speedy return, the ambitious designs of his brothers, who might occupy the throne and treasures of Toulouse.
(46) After the departure of the Goths, and the separation of the allied army, <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> was surprised at the vast silence that reigned over the plains of Chalons: the suspicion of some hostile stratagem detained him several days within the circle of his waggons, and his retreat beyond the <PERSON>Rhine</PERSON> confessed the last victory which was achieved in the name of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 <PERSON>Meroveus</PERSON> and his Franks, observing a prudent distance, and magnifying the opinion of their strength by the numerous fires which they kindled every night, continued to follow the rear of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> till they reached the confines of Thuringia.
 The <NORP>Thuringians</NORP> served in the army of Attila: they traversed, both in their march and in their return, the territories of the Franks; and it was perhaps in this war that they exercised the cruelties which, about four-score years afterwards, were revenged by the son of Clovis.
 They massacred their hostages, as well as their captives: <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> young maidens were tortured with exquisite and unrelenting rage; their bodies were torn asunder by wild horses, or their bones were crushed under the weight of rolling waggons; and their unburied limbs were abandoned on the public roads as a prey to dogs and vultures.
 Such were those savage ancestors whose imaginary virtues have sometimes excited the praise and envy of civilised ages !(47) Invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by Attila, A.
D.
 452.
 Neither the spirit, nor the forces, nor the reputation of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> were impaired by the failure of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> expedition.
 In the ensuing spring he repeated his demand of the princess <PERSON>Honoria</PERSON> and her patrimonial treasures.
 The demand was again rejected or eluded; and the indignant lover immediately took the field, passed the Alps, invaded Italy, and besieged <GPE>Aquileia</GPE> with an innumerable host of barbarians.
 Those barbarians were unskilled in the methods of conducting a regular siege, which, even among the ancients, required some knowledge, or at least some practice, of the mechanic arts.
 But the labour of many thousand provincials and captives, whose lives were sacrificed without pity, might execute the most painful and dangerous work.
 The skill of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> artists might be corrupted to the destruction of their country.
 The walls of <GPE>Aquileia</GPE> were assaulted by a formidable train of battering rams, movable turrets, and engines that threw stones, darts, and fire;(48) and the monarch of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> employed the forcible impulse of hope, fear, emulation and interest, to subvert the only barrier which delayed the conquest of Italy.
 <GPE>Aquileia</GPE> was at that period <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the richest, the most Populous, and the strongest of the maritime cities of the <PERSON>Hadriatic</PERSON> coast.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> auxiliaries, who appear to have served under their native princes, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> and Antala, communicated their intrepid spirit; and the citizens still remembered the glorious and successful resistance which their ancestors had opposed to a fierce, inexorable barbarian, who disgraced the majesty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> purple.
 Three months were consumed without effect in the siege of Aquileia; till the want of provisions and the clamours of his army compelled <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> to relinquish the enterprise, and reluctantly to issue his orders that the troops should strike their tents the next morning, and begin their retreat.
 But as he rode round the walls, pensive, angry, and disappointed, he observed a stork preparing to leave her nest in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the towers, and to fly with her infant family towards the country.
 He seized, with the ready penetration of a statesman, this trifling incident which chance had offered to superstition; and exclaimed, in a loud and cheerful tone, that such a domestic bird, so constantly attached to human society, would never have abandoned her ancient seats unless those towers had been devoted to impending ruin and solitude.
(49) The favourable omen inspired an assurance of victory; the siege was renewed, and prosecuted with fresh vigour; a large breach was made in the part of the wall from whence the stork had taken her flight; the <NORP>Huns</NORP> mounted to the assault with irresistible fury; and the succeeding generation could scarcely discover the ruins of Aquileia.
(50) After this dreadful chastisement, <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> pursued his march; and as he passed, the cities of Altinumn Concordia, and <GPE>Padua</GPE> were reduced into heaps of stones and ashes.
 The inland towns, Vicenza, Verona, and Bergamo, were exposed to the rapacious cruelty of the Huns.
 <GPE>Milan</GPE> and <GPE>Pavia</GPE> submitted, without resistance, to the loss of their wealth; and applauded the unusual clemency which preserved from the flames the public as well as private buildings, and spared the lives of the captive multitude.
 The popular traditions of Comum, Turin, or <GPE>Modena</GPE> may justly be respected; yet they concur with more authentic evidence to prove that <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> spread his ravages over the rich plains of modern Lombardy, which are divided by the Po, and bounded by the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and Apennine.
 (51) When he took possession of the royal palace of Milan, he was surprised and offended at the sight of a picture which represented the <PERSON>Caesars</PERSON> seated on their throne, and the princes of <GPE>Scythia</GPE> prostrate at their feet.
 The revenge which <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> inflicted on this monument of <NORP>Roman</NORP> vanity was harmless and ingenious.
 He commanded a painter to reverse the figures and the attitudes; and the emperors were delineated on the same canvas approaching in a suppliant posture to empty their bags of tributary gold before the throne of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> monarch.
(52) The spectators must have confessed the truth and propriety of the alteration; and were perhaps tempted to apply, on this singular occasion, the well-known fable of the dispute between the lion and the man.
(53) Foundation of the republic of Venice.
 It is a saying worthy of the ferocious pride of Attila, that the grass never grew on the spot where his horse had trod.
 Yet the savage destroyer undesignedly laid the foundations of a republic which revived, in the feudal state of Europe, the art and spirit of a commercial industry.
 The celebrated name of Venice, or Venetia,(54) was formerly diffused over a larger and fertile province of Italy, from the confines of <GPE>Pannonia</GPE> to the river Addua, and from the <LOC>Po</LOC> to the <LOC>Rhaetian</LOC> and the Julian Alps.
 Before the irruption of the barbarians, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Venetian</NORP> cities flourished in peace and prosperity: <GPE>Aquileia</GPE> was placed in the most conspicuous station: but the ancient dignity of <GPE>Padua</GPE> was supported by agriculture and manufactures; and the property of five <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> citizens, who were entitled to the equestrian rank, must have amounted, at the strictest computation, to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> million seven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand pounds.
 Many families of .
Aquileia, Padua, and the adjacent towns, who fled from the sword of the Huns, found a safe, though obscure, refuge in the neighbouring islands.
(55) At the extremity of the Gulf, where the <PERSON>Hadriatic</PERSON> feebly imitates the tides of the ocean, near an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> small islands are separated by shallow water from the continent, and protected from the waves by several long slips of land, which admit the entrance of vessels through some secret and narrow channels.
(56) Till the middle of the fifth century these remote and sequestered spots remained without cultivation, with few inhabitants, and almost without a name.
 But the manners of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> fugitives, their arts and their government, were gradually formed by their new situation; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the epistles of Cassiodorus, (57) which describes their condition about seventy years afterwards, may be considered as the primitive monument of the republic.
 The minister of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> compares them, in his quaint declamatory style, to waterfowl, who had fixed their nests on the bosom of the waves; and though he allows that the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> provinces had formerly contained many noble families, he insinuates that they were now reduced by misfortune to the same level of humble poverty.
 Fish was the common, and almost the universal, food of every rank: their only treasure consisted in the plenty of salt which they extracted from the sea: and the exchange of that commodity, so essential to human life, was substituted in the neighbouring markets to the currency of gold and silver.
 A people whose habitations might be doubtfully assigned to the earth or water soon became alike familiar with the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> elements; and the demands of avarice succeeded to those of necessity.
 The islanders, who, from <LOC>Grado</LOC> to Chiozza, were intimately connected with each other, penetrated into the heart of Italy, by the secure, though laborious, navigation of the rivers and inland canals.
 Their vessels, which were continually increasing in size and number, visited all the harbours of the Gulf; and the marriage which <GPE>Venice</GPE> annually celebrates with the <PERSON>Hadriatic</PERSON> was contracted in her early infancy.
 The epistle of Cassiodorus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is addressed to the maritime tribunes; and he exhorts them, in a mild tone of authority, to animate the zeal of their countrymen for the public service, which required their assistance to transport the magazines of wine and oil from the province of <GPE>Istria</GPE> to the royal city of Ravenna.
 The ambiguous office of these magistrates is explained by the tradition, that, in the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal islands, <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> tribunes, or judges, were created by an <DATE>annual</DATE> and popular election.
 The existence of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> republic under the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kingdom of <GPE>Italy</GPE> is attested by the same authentic record which annihilates their lofty claim of original and perpetual independence.
(58) <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> gives peace to the Romans.
 The Italians, who had long since renounced the exercise of arms, were surprised, after forty years' peace, by the approach of a formidable barbarian, whom they abhorred as the enemy of their religion as well as of their republic.
 Amidst the general consternation, <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> alone was incapable of fear; but it was impossible that he should achieve alone and unassisted any military exploits worthy of his former renown.
 The barbarians who had defended <LOC>Gaul</LOC> refused to march to the relief of Italy; and the succours promised by the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> emperor were distant and doubtful.
 Since Aetius, at the head of his domestic troops, still maintained the field, and harassed or retarded the march of Attila, he never showed himself more truly great than at the time when his conduct was blamed by an ignorant and ungrateful people.
(59) If the mind of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> had been susceptible of any generous sentiments, he would have chosen such a general for his example and his guide.
 But the timid grandson of Theodosius, instead of sharing the dangers, escaped from the sound, of war; and his hasty retreat from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, from an impregnable fortress to an open capital, betrayed his secret intention of abandoning <GPE>Italy</GPE> as soon as the danger should approach his <ORG>Imperial</ORG> person.
 This shameful abdication was suspended, however, by the spirit of doubt and delay which commonly adheres to pusillanimous counsels, and sometimes corrects their pernicious tendency.
 The <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, with the senate and people of Rome, embraced the more salutary resolution of deprecating, by a solemn and suppliant embassy, the wrath of Attila.
 This important commission was accepted by Avienus, who, from his birth and riches, his consular dignity, the numerous train of his clients, and his personal abilities, held the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rank in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 The specious and artful character of Avienus(60) was admirably qualified to conduct a negotiation either of public or private interest: his colleague <PERSON>Trigetius</PERSON> had exercised the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefecture of Italy; and Leo, bishop of Rome, consented to expose his life for the safety of his flock.
 The genius of Leo(61) was exercised and displayed in the public misfortunes; and he has deserved the appellation of Great by the successful zeal with which he laboured to establish his opinions and his authority, under the venerable names of orthodox faith and ecclesiastical discipline.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassadors were introduced to the tent of Attila, as he lay encamped at the place where the slow-winding <GPE>Mincius</GPE> is lost in the foaming waves of the lake Benacus, (62) and trampled, with his <NORP>Scythian</NORP> cavalry, the farms of <GPE>Catullus</GPE> and Virgil.
(63) The barbarian monarch listened with favourable, and even respectful, attention; and the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was purchased by the immense ransom or dowry of the princess Honoria.
 The state of his army might facilitate the treaty and hasten his retreat.
 Their martial spirit was relaxed by the wealth and indolence of a warm climate.
 The shepherds of the North, whose ordinary food consisted of milk and raw flesh, indulged themselves too freely in the use of bread, of wine, and of meat prepared and seasoned by the arts of cookery; and the progress of disease revenged in some measure the injuries of the Italians.
 (64) When <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> declared his resolution of carrying his victorious arms to the gates of Rome, he was admonished by his friends, as well as by his enemies, that <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had not long survived the conquest of the eternal city.
 His mind, superior to real danger, was assaulted by imaginary terrors; nor could he escape the influence of superstition, which had so often been subservient to his designs.
(65) The pressing eloquence of Leo, his majestic aspect and sacerdotal robes, excited the veneration of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> for the spiritual father of the Christians.
 The apparition of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> apostles of St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul, who menaced the barbarian with instant death if he rejected the prayer of their successor, is <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the noblest legends of ecclesiastical tradition.
 The safety of <GPE>Rome</GPE> might deserve the interposition of celestial beings; and some indulgence is due to a fable which has been represented by the pencil of <PERSON>Raphael</PERSON> and the chisel of Algardi.
(66) The death of Attila, A.
D.
 453.
 Before the king of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> evacuated Italy, he threatened to return more dreadful, and more implacable, if his bride, the princess Honoria, were not delivered to his ambassadors within the term stipulated by the treaty.
 Yet, in the meanwhile, <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> relieved his tender anxiety, by adding a beautiful maid, whose name was Ildico, to the list of his innumerable wives.
(67) Their marriage was celebrated with barbaric pomp and festivity, at his wooden palace beyond the Danube; and the monarch, oppressed with wine and sleep, retired at a late hour from the banquet to the nuptial bed.
 His attendants continued to respect his pleasures or his repose the greatest part of the ensuing day, till the unusual silence alarmed their fears and suspicions; and, after attempting to awaken <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> by loud and repeated cries, they at length broke into the royal apartment.
 They found the trembling bride sitting by the bedside, hiding her face with her veil, and lamenting her own danger, as well as the death of the king, who had expired during the night.
(68) An artery had suddenly burst: and as <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> lay in a supine posture, he was suffocated by a torrent of blood, which, instead of finding a passage through the nostrils, regurgitated into the lungs and stomach.
 His body was solemnly exposed in the midst of the plain, under a silken pavilion; and the chosen squadrons of the Huns, wheeling round in measured evolutions, chanted a funeral song to the memory of a hero, glorious in his life, invincible in his death, the father of his people, the scourge of his enemies, and the terror of the world.
 According to their national custom, the barbarians cut off a part of their hair, gashed their faces with unseemly wounds, and bewailed their valiant leader as he deserved, not with the tears of women, but with the blood of warriors.
 The remains of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> were enclosed within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> coffins of gold, of silver, and of iron, and privately buried in the night: the spoils of nations were thrown into his grave; the captives who had opened the ground were inhumanly massacred; and the same Huns, who had indulged such excessive grief, feasted, with dissolute and intemperate mirth, about the recent sepulchre of their king.
 It was reported at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> that, on the fortunate night in which he expired, <PERSON>Marcian</PERSON> beheld in a dream the bow of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> broken asunder: and the report may be allowed to prove how seldom the image of that formidable barbarian was absent from the mind of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
(69) Destruction of his empire.
 The revolution which subverted the empire of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> established the fame of Attila, whose genius alone had sustained the huge and disjointed fabric.
 After his death the boldest chieftains aspired to the rank of kings; the most powerful kings refused to acknowledge a superior; and the numerous sons whom so many various mothers bore to the deceased monarch divided and disputed like a private inheritance the sovereign command of the nations of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
 The bold <PERSON>Ardaric</PERSON> felt and represented the disgrace of this servile partition and his subjects, the warlike Gepidae, with the Ostrogoths, under the conduct of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> valiant brothers, encouraged their allies to vindicate the rights of freedom and royalty.
 In a bloody and decisive conflict on the banks of the river <PERSON>Netad</PERSON> in Pannonia, the lance of the Gepidae, the sword of the Goths, the arrows of the Huns, the <NORP>Suevic</NORP> infantry, the light arms of the Heruli, and the heavy weapons of the Alani, encountered or supported each other; and the victory of <PERSON>Ardaric</PERSON> was accompanied with the slaughter of thirty thousand of his enemies.
 Ellac, the eldest on of Attila, lost his life and crown in the memorable battle of Netad; his early valour had raised him to the throne of the Acatzires, a <NORP>Scyhlan</NORP> people, whom he subdued; and his father, who loved the superior merit, would have envied the death, of Ellac.
(70) His brother Dengisich, with an army of <NORP>Huns</NORP> still formidable in their flight and ruin, maintained his ground above fifteen years on the banks of the Danube.
 The palace of Attila, with the old country of <GPE>Daciab</GPE> from the Carpathian hills to the Euxine, became the seat of a new power which was erected by Ardaric, king of the Gepidae.
 The <NORP>Pannonian</NORP> conquests, from <GPE>Vienna</GPE> to Sirmium, were occupied by the Ostrogoths; and the settlements of the tribes who had so bravely asserted their native freedom were irregularly distributed according to the measure of their respective strength.
 Surrounded and oppressed by the multitude of his father's slaves, the kingdom of <PERSON>Dengisich</PERSON> was confined to the circle of his waggons; his desperate courage urged him to invade the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire: he fell in battle, and his head, ignominiously exposed in the Hippodrome, exhibited a grateful spectacle to the people of Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> had fondly or superstitiously believed that Irnac, the youngest of his sons, was destined to perpetuate the glories of his race.
 The character of that prince, who attempted to moderate the rashness of his brother Dengisich, was more suitable to the declining condition of the Huns; and Irnac, with his subject hordes, retired into the heart of the Lesser Scythia.
 They were soon overwhelmed by a torrent of new barbarians, who followed the same road which their own ancestors had formerly discovered.
 The Geougen, or Avares, whose residence is assigned by the <NORP>Greek</NORP> writers to the shores of the ocean, impelled the adjacent tribes; till at length the <PERSON>Igours</PERSON> of the North, issuing from the cold <NORP>Siberian</NORP> regions which produce the most valuable furs, spread themselves over the desert as far as the <LOC>Borysthenes</LOC> and the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> gates, and finally extinguished the empire of the Huns.
(71) <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> murders the patrician Aetius, A.
D.
 454.
 Such an event might contribute to the safety of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire under the reign of a prince who conciliated the friendship, without forfeiting the esteem, of the barbarians.
 But the emperor of the West, the feeble and dissolute Valentinian, who had reached his thirty-fifth year without attaining the age of reason or courage, abused this apparent security to undermine the foundations of his own throne by the murder of the patrician Aetius.
 From the instinct of a base and jealous mind, he hated the man who was universally celebrated as the terror of the barbarians and the support of the republic; and his new favourite, the eunuch Heraclius, awakened the emperor from the supine lethargy which might be disguised during the life of Placidia(72) by the excuse of filial piety.
 The fame of Aetius, his wealth and dignity, the numerous and martial train of barbarian followers, his powerful dependents who filled the civil offices of the state, and the hopes of his son Gaudentius, who was already contracted to Eudoxia, the emperor's daughter, had raised him above the rank of a subject.
 The ambitious designs, of which he was secretly accused, excited the fears as well as the resentment of Valentinian.
 <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> himself, supported by the consciousness of his merit, his services, and perhaps his innocence, seems to have maintained a haughty and indiscreet behaviour.
 The patrician offended his sovereign by an hostile declaration; he aggravated the offence by compelling him to ratify with a solemn oath a treaty of reconciliation and alliance; he proclaimed his suspicions, he neglected his safety; and from a vain confidence that the enemy whom he despised was incapable even of a manly crime, he rashly ventured his person in the palace of Rome.
 Whilst he urged, perhaps with intemperate vehemence, the marriage of his son, Valentinian, drawing his sword - the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> sword he had ever drawn - plunged it in the breast of a general who had saved his empire: his courtiers and eunuchs ambitiously struggled to imitate their master; and Aetius, pierced with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> wounds, fell dead in the royal presence.
 Boethius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, was killed at the same moment; and before the event could be divulged, the principal friends of the patrician were summoned to the palace and separately murdered.
 The horrid deed, palliated by the specious names of justice and necessity, was immediately communicated by the emperor to his soldiers, his subjects, and his allies.
 The nations who were strangers or enemies to <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> generously deplored the unworthy fate of a hero; the barbarians who had been attached to his service dissembled their grief and resentment; and the public contempt which had been so long entertained for <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was at once converted into deep and universal abhorrence.
 Such sentiments seldom pervade the walls of a palace; yet the emperor was confounded by the honest reply of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> whose approbation he had not disdained to solicit.
 and ravishes the wife of Maximus.
 The luxury of <GPE>Rome</GPE> seems to have attracted the long and frequent visits of Valentinian, who was consequently more despised at <GPE>Rome</GPE> than in any other part of his dominions.
 A <NORP>republican</NORP> spirit was insensibly revived in the senate, as their authority, and even their supplies, became necessary for the support of his feeble government.
 The stately demeanour of an hereditary monarch offended their pride, and the pleasures of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> were injurious to the peace and honour of noble families.
 The birth of the empress <PERSON>Eudoxia</PERSON> was equal to his own, and her charms and tender affection deserved those testimonies of love which her inconstant husband dissipated in vague and unlawful amours.
 Petronius Maximus, a wealthy senator of the <PERSON>Anician</PERSON> family, who had been twice consul was possessed of a chaste and beautiful wife; her obstinate resistance served only to irritate the desires of Valentinian, and he resolved to accomplish them either by stratagem or force.
 Deep gaming was <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the vices of the court; the emperor, who, by chance or contrivance, had gained from <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> a considerable sum, uncourteously exacted his ring as a security for the debt, and sent it by a trusty messenger to his wife, with an order in her husband's name that she should immediately attend the empress Eudoxia.
 The unsuspecting wife of <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> was conveyed in her litter to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> palace; the emissaries of her impatient lover conducted her to a remote and silent bedchamber; and <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> violated, without remorse, the laws of hospitality.
 Her tears when she returned home, her deep affliction, and the bitter reproaches against a husband whom she considered as the accomplice of his own shame, excited <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> to a just revenge; the desire of revenge was stimulated by ambition; and he might reasonably aspire, by the free suffrage of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, to the throne of a detested and despicable rival.
 Valentinian, who supposed that every human breast was devoid like his own of friendship and gratitude, had imprudently admitted among his guards several domestics and followers of Aetius.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> of these, of barbarian race, were persuaded to execute a sacred and honourable duty by punishing with death the assassin of their patron, and their intrepid courage did not long expect a favourable moment.
 Death of Valentinian, A.
D.
 455, March 16.
 Whilst <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> amused himself in the field of <LOC>Mars</LOC> with the spectacle of some military sports, they suddenly rushed upon him with drawn weapons, despatched the guilty Heraclius, and stabbed the emperor to the heart, without the least opposition from his numerous train, who seemed to rejoice in the tyrant's death.
 Such was the fate of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> the Third, (74) the last <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor of the family of Theodosius.
 He faithfully imitated the hereditary weakness of his cousin and his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> uncles, without inheriting the gentleness, the purity, the innocence, which alleviate in their characters the want of spirit and ability.
 <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was less excusable, since he had passions without virtues: even his religion was questionable; and though he never deviated into the paths of heresy, he scandalised the pious <NORP>Christians</NORP> by his attachment to the profane arts of magic and divination.
 Symptoms of decay and ruin.
 As early as the time of <PERSON>Cicero</PERSON> and <PERSON>Varro</PERSON> it was the opinion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> augurs that the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> vultures which <PERSON>Romulus</PERSON> had seen, represented the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> centuries assigned for the fatal period of his city(75) This prophecy, disregarded perhaps in the season of health and prosperity, inspired the people with gloomy apprehensions when the twelfth century, clouded with disgrace and misfortune, was almost elapsed;(76) and even posterity must acknowledge with some surprise that the arbitrary interpretation of an accidental or fabulous circumstance has been seriously verified in the downfall of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 But its fall was announced by a clearer omen than the flight of vultures: the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government appeared every day less formidable to its enemies, more odious and oppressive to its subjects.
 (77) The taxes were multiplied with the public distress; economy was neglected in proportion as it became necessary; and the injustice of the rich shifted the unequal burden from themselves to the people, whom they defrauded of the indulgences that might sometimes have alleviated their misery.
 The severe inquisition, which confiscated their goods and tortured their persons, compelled the subjects of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> to prefer the more simple tyranny of the barbarians, to fly to the woods and mountains, or to embrace the vile and abject condition of mercenary servants.
 They abjured and abhorred the name of <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens, which had formerly excited the ambition of mankind.
 The <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> and the greatest part of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were thrown into a state of disorderly independence by the confederations of the Bagaudae, and the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> ministers pursued with proscriptive laws and ineffectual arms the rebels whom they had made.
 (78) If all the barbarian conquerors had been annihilated in the same hour, their total destruction would not have restored the empire of the West: and if <GPE>Rome</GPE> still survived, she survived the loss of freedom, of virtue, and of honour.
