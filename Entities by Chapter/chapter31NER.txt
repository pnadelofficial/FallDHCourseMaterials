D.
 408, <DATE>September</DATE> THE incapacity of a weak and distracted government may often assume the appearance and produce the effects of a treasonable correspondence with the public enemy.
 If <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself had been introduced into the council of Ravenna, he would probably have advised the same measures which were actually pursued by the ministers of Honorius.
(1) The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> would have conspired, perhaps with some reluctance, to destroy the formidable adversary by whose arms, in <GPE>Italy</GPE> as well as in Greece, he had been twice overthrown.
 Their active and interested hatred laboriously accomplished the disgrace and ruin of the great Stilicho.
 The valour of Sarus, his fame in arms, and his personal or hereditary influence over the confederate barbarians, could recommend him only to the friends of their country who despised or detested the worthless characters of Turpilio, Varanes, and Vigilantius.
 By the pressing instances of the new favourites, these generals, unworthy as they had shown themselves of the name of soldiers,(2) were promoted to the command of the cavalry, of the infantry, and of the domestic troops.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince would have subscribed with pleasure the edict which the fanaticism of <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> dictated to the simple and devout emperor.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> excluded all persons who were adverse to the catholic church from holding any office in the state; obstinately rejected the service of all those who dissented from his religion; and rashly disqualified many of his bravest and most skilful officers who adhered to the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> worship or who had imbibed the opinions of Arianism.
 (3) These measures, so advantageous to an enemy, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> would have approved, and might perhaps have suggested; but it may seem doubtful whether the barbarian would have promoted his interest at the expense of the inhuman and absurd cruelty which was perpetrated by the direction, or at least with the connivance, of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers.
 The foreign auxiliaries who had been attached to the person of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> lamented his death; but the desire of revenge was checked by a natural apprehension for the safety of their wives and children, who were detained as hostages in the strong cities of Italy, where they had likewise deposited their most valuable effects.
 At the same hour, and as if by a common signal, the cities of <GPE>Italy</GPE> were polluted by the same horrid scenes of universal massacre and pillage, which involved in promiscuous destruction the families and fortunes of the barbarians.
 Exasperated by such an injury, which might have awakened the tamest and most servile spirit, they cast a look of indignation and hope towards the camp of Alaric, and unanimously swore to pursue with just and implacable war the perfidious nation that had so basely violated the laws of hospitality.
 By the imprudent conduct of the ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> the republic lost the assistance, and deserved the enmity, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of her bravest soldiers; and the weight of that formidable army, which alone might have determined the event of the war, was transferred from the scale of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> into that of the Goths.
 <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> marches to Rome, A.
D.
 408, October, etc In the arts of negotiation, as well as in those of war, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king maintained his superior ascendant over an enemy whose seeming changes proceeded from the total want of counsel and design.
 From his camp, on the confines of Italy, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> attentively observed the revolutions of the palace, watched the progress of faction and discontent, disguised the hostile aspect of a barbarian invader, and assumed the more popular appearance of the friend and ally of the great Stilicho; to whose virtues, when they were no longer formidable, he could pay a just tribute of sincere praise and regret.
 The pressing invitation of the malcontents, who urged the king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> to invade Italy, was enforced by a lively sense of his personal injuries; and he might speciously complain that the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers still delayed and eluded the payment of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold which had been granted by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate either to reward his services or to appease his fury.
 His decent firmness was supported by an artful moderation, which contributed to the success of his designs.
 He required a fair and reasonable satisfaction; but he gave the strongest assurances that, as soon as he had obtained it, he would immediately retire.
 He refused to trust the faith of the Romans, unless <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> and Jason, the sons of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great officers of state, were sent as hostages to his camp: but he offered to deliver in exchange several of the noblest youths of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation.
 The modesty of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was interpreted by the ministers of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> as a sure evidence of his weakness and fear.
 They disdained either to negotiate a treaty or to assemble an army and with a rash confidence, derived only from their ignorance of the extreme danger, irretrievably wasted the decisive moments of peace and war.
 While they expected, in sullen silence, that the barbarians should evacuate the confines of Italy, Alaric, with bold and rapid marches, passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and the Po; hastily pillaged the cities of Aquileia, Altinum, Concordia, and Cremona, which yielded to his arms; increased his forces by the accession of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> auxiliaries, and without meeting a single enemy in the field, advanced as far as the edge of the morass which protected the impregnable residence of the emperor of the West.
 Instead of attempting the hopeless siege of Ravenna, the prudent leader of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> proceeded to Rimini, stretched his ravages along the sea-coast of the Hadriatic, and meditated the conquest of the ancient mistress of the world.
 An <NORP>Italian</NORP> hermit, whose zeal and sanctity were respected by the barbarians themselves, encountered the victorious monarch, and boldly denounced the indignation of Heaven against the oppressors of the earth: but the saint himself was confounded by the solemn asseveration of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> that he felt a secret and preternatural impulse, which directed, and even compelled, his march to the gates of <GPE>Rome</GPE> He felt that his genius and his fortune were equal to the most arduous enterprises; and the enthusiasm which he communicated to the <NORP>Goths</NORP> insensibly removed the popular and almost superstitious reverence of the nations for the majesty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name.
 His troops, animated by the hopes of spoil, followed the course of the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way, occupied the unguarded passes of the Apennine,(4) descended into the rich plains of Umbria; and, as they lay encamped on the banks of the Clitumnus, might wantonly slaughter and devour the milk-white oxen which had been so long reserved for the use of <NORP>Roman</NORP> triumphs.
(5) A lofty situation and a seasonable tempest of thunder and lightning preserved the little city of Narni: but the king of the Goths, despising the ignoble prey, still advanced with unabated vigour; and after he had passed through the stately arches, adorned with the spoils of barbaric victories, he pitched his camp under the walls of Rome.
(6) <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> at the gates of <GPE>Rome</GPE> During a period of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and nineteen years the seat of empire had never been violated by the presence of a foreign enemy.
 The unsuccessful expedition of Hannibal(7) served only to display the character of the senate and people; of a senate degraded, rather than ennobled, by the comparison of an assembly of kings; and of a people to whom the ambassador of <PERSON>Pyrrhus</PERSON> ascribed the inexhaustible resources of the Hydra.
 (8) Each of the senators in the time of the Punic war had accomplished his term of military service, either in a subordinate or a superior station; and the decree which invested with temporary command all those who had been consuls, or censors, or dictators, gave the republic the immediate assistance of many brave and experienced generals.
 In the beginning of the war the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people consisted of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> citizens of an age to bear arms.
(9) <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> had already died in the defence of their country; and the <CARDINAL>twenty-three</CARDINAL> legions which were employed in the different camps of Italy, Greece, Sardinia, Sicily, and Spain, required about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men.
 But there still remained an equal number in <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the adjacent territory who were animated by the same intrepid courage; and every citizen was trained from his earliest youth in the discipline and exercises of a soldier.
 <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> was astonished by the constancy of the senate, who, without raising the siege of <LOC>Capua</LOC> or recalling their scattered forces, expected his approach.
 He encamped on the banks of the Anio, at the distance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles from the city: and he was soon informed that the ground on which he had pitched his tent was sold for an adequate price at a public auction; and that a body of troops was dismissed by an opposite road to reinforce the legions of Spain.
(10) He led his <NORP>Africans</NORP> to the gates of Rome, where he found <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> armies in order of battle prepared to receive him; but <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> dreaded the event of a combat from which he could not hope to escape unless he destroyed the last of his enemies; and his speedy retreat confessed the invincible courage of the Romans.
 Genealogy of the senators From the time of the Punic war the uninterrupted succession of senators had preserved the name and image of the republic; and the degenerate subjects of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> ambitiously derived their descent from the heroes who had repulsed the arms of <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> and subdued the nations of the earth.
 The temporal honours which the devout <PERSON>Paula</PERSON> (11) inherited and despised are carefully recapitulated by Jerom, the guide of her conscience and the historian of her life.
 The genealogy of her father, Rogatus, which ascended as high as Agamemnon, might seem to betray a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> origin; but her mother, Blasilla, numbered the Scipios, Amilius Paulus, and the <PERSON>Gracchi</PERSON> in the list of her ancestors; and Toxotius, the husband of Paula, deduced his royal lineage from Aeneas, the father of the <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> line.
 The vanity of the rich, who desired to be noble, was gratified by these lofty pretensions.
 Encouraged by the applause of their parasites, they easily imposed on the credulity of the vulgar; and were countenanced in some measure by the custom of adopting the name of their patron, which had always prevailed among the freedmen and clients of illustrious families.
 Most of those families, however, attacked by so many causes of external violence or internal decay, were gradually extirpated: and it would be more reasonable to seek for a lineal descent of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> generations among the mountains of the <LOC>Alps</LOC> or in the peaceful solitude of Apulia, than on the theatre of Rome, the seat of fortune, of danger, and of perpetual revolutions.
 Under each successive reign and from every province of the empire a crowd of hardy adventurers, rising to eminence by their talents or their vices, usurped the wealth, the honours, and the palaces of Rome; and oppressed or protected the poor and humble remains of consular families, who were ignorant, perhaps, of the glory of their ancestors.
(12) The <NORP>Anician</NORP> family In the time of <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> the senators unanimously yielded the pre-eminence to the <NORP>Anician</NORP> line; and a slight view of their history will serve to appreciate the rank and antiquity of the noble families which contended only for the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> place.
(13) During the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ages of the city the name of the <PERSON>Anicians</PERSON> was unknown; they appear to have derived their origin from Praeneste; and the ambition of those new citizens was long satisfied with the plebeian honours of tribunes of the people.
(14) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-eight years before the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era the family was ennobled by the praetorship of Anicius, who gloriously terminated the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> war by the conquest of the nation and the captivity of their king.
 (15) From the triumph of that general <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> consulships in distant periods mark the succession of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> name.
(16) From the reign of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> to the final extinction of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire that name shone with a lustre which was not eclipsed in the public estimation by the majesty of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple.
(17) The several branches to whom it was communicated united, by marriage or inheritance, the wealth and titles of the Annian, the Petronian, and the <NORP>Olybrian</NORP> houses; and in each generation the number of consulships was multiplied by an hereditary claim.
(18) The <NORP>Anician</NORP> family excelled in faith and in riches: they were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate who embraced <NORP>Christianity</NORP> and it is probable that <PERSON>Anicius</PERSON> Julian, who was afterwards consul and praefect of the city, atoned for his attachment to the party of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> by the readiness with which he accepted the religion of Constantine.
 (19) Their ample patrimony was increased by the industry of Probus, the chief of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, who shared with <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> the honours of the consulship, and exercised <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> times the high office of <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect.
 (20) His immense estates were scattered over the wide extent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; and though the public might suspect or disapprove the methods by which they had been acquired, the generosity and magnificence of that fortunate statesman deserved the gratitude of his clients and the admiration of strangers.
(21) Such was the respect entertained for his memory, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons of Probus, in their earliest youth and at the request of the senate, were associated in the consular dignity: a memorable distinction, without example in the annals of Rome.
(22) Wealth of <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles.
 "The marbles of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> palace," were used as a proverbial expression of opulence and splendour;(23) but the nobles and senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> aspired in due gradation to imitate that illustrious family.
 The accurate description of the city, which was composed in the <GPE>Theodosian</GPE> age, enumerates <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty houses, the residence of wealthy and honourable citizens.
 (24) Many of these stately mansions might almost excuse the exaggeration of the poet—that <GPE>Rome</GPE> contained a multitude of palaces, and that each palace was equal to a city, since it included within its own precincts everything which could be subservient either to use or luxury: markets, hippodromes, temples, fountains, baths, porticos, shady groves, and artificial aviaries.
(25) The historian Olympiodorus, who represents the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> when it was besieged by the Goths,(26) continues to observe that several of the richest senators received from their estates an annual income of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling; without computing the stated provision of corn and wine, which, had they been sold, might have equalled in value <CARDINAL>one-third</CARDINAL> of the money.
 Compared to this immoderate wealth, an ordinary revenue of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds of gold might be considered as no more than adequate to the dignity of the <NORP>senatorian</NORP> rank, which required many expenses of a public and ostentatious kind.
 Several examples are recorded in the age of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> of vain and popular nobles who celebrated the year of their praetorship by a festival which lasted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days and cost above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling.
(27) The estates of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, which so far exceed the proportion of modern wealth, were not confined to the limits of Italy.
 Their possessions extended far beyond the <NORP>Ionian</NORP> and <NORP>Agean</NORP> seas to the most distant provinces: the city of Nicopolis, which <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> had founded as an eternal monument of the <NORP>Actian</NORP> victory, was the property of the devout Paula;(28) and it is observed by Seneca, that the rivers which had divided hostile nations now flowed through the lands of private citizens.
(29) According to their temper and circumstances, the estates of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were either cultivated by the labour of their slaves, or granted, for a certain and stipulated rent, to the industrious farmer.
 The economical writers of antiquity strenuously recommend the former method wherever it may be practicable but if the object should be removed by its distance or magnitude from the immediate eye of the master, they prefer the active care of an old hereditary tenant, attached to the soil and interested in the produce, to the mercenary administration of a negligent, perhaps an unfaithful steward.
(30) Their manners The opulent nobles of an immense capital, who were never excited by the pursuit of military glory, and seldom engaged in the occupations of civil government, naturally resigned their leisure to the business and amusements of private life.
 At <GPE>Rome</GPE> commerce was always held in contempt; but the senators, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age of the republic, increased their patrimony and multiplied their clients by the lucrative practice of usury, and the obsolete laws were eluded or violated by the mutual inclinations and interest of both parties.
 (31) A considerable mass of treasure must always have existed at Rome, either in the current coin of the empire, or in the form of gold and silver plate; and there were many sideboards in the time of Pliny which contained more solid silver than had been transported by <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> from vanquished Carthage.
(32) The greater part of the nobles, who dissipated their fortunes in profuse luxury, found themselves poor in the midst of wealth, and idle in a constant round of dissipation.
 Their desires were continually gratified by the labour of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> hands; of the numerous train of their domestic slaves, who were actuated by the fear of punishment; and of the various professions of artificers and merchants, who were more powerfully impelled by the hopes of gain.
 The ancients were destitute of many of the conveniences of life which have been invented or improved by the progress of industry; and the plenty of glass and linen has diffused more real comforts among the modern nations of <LOC>Europe</LOC> than the senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> could derive from all the refinements of pompous or sensual luxury.
(33) Their luxury and their manners have been the subject of minute and laborious disquisition; but as such inquiries would divert me too long from the design of the present work, I shall produce an authentic state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and its inhabitants which is more peculiarly applicable to the period of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion.
 <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus, who prudently chose the capital of the empire as the residence the best adapted to the historian of his own times, has mixed with the narrative of public events a lively representation of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant.
 The judicious reader will not always approve the asperity of censure, the choice of circumstances, or the style of expression; he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices and personal resentments which soured the temper of <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> himself; but he will surely observe, with philosophic curiosity, the interesting and original picture of the manners of Rome.
(34) Character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles, by <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus "The greatness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> (such is the language of the historian) was founded on the rare and almost incredible alliance of virtue and of fortune.
 The long period of her infancy was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of Italy, the neighbours and enemies of the rising city.
 In the strength and ardour of youth she sustained the storms of war, carried her victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains, and brought home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe.
 At length, verging towards old age, and sometimes conquering by the terror only of her name, she sought the blessings of ease and tranquillity.
 The VENERABLE CITY, which had trampled on the necks of the fiercest nations, and established a system of laws, the perpetual guardians of justice and freedom, was content, like a wise and wealthy parent, to devolve on the Caesars, her favourite sons, the care of governing her ample patrimony.
 (35) A secure and profound peace, such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of Numa, succeeded to the tumults of a republic; while <GPE>Rome</GPE> was still adored as the queen of the earth, and the subject nations still reverenced the name of the people and the majesty of the senate.
 But this native splendour (continues Ammianus) is degraded and sullied by the conduct of some nobles, who, unmindful of their own dignity and of that of their country, assume an unbounded licence of vice and folly.
 They contend with each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames, and curiously select or invent the most lofty and sonorous appellations — <PERSON>Reburrus</PERSON> or Fabunius, <PERSON>Pagonius</PERSON> or <PERSON>Tarrasius</PERSON> (36) which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and respect.
 From a vain ambition of perpetuating their memory, they affect to multiply their likeness in statues of bronze and marble; nor are they satisfied unless those statues are covered with plates of gold; an honourable distinction, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> granted to <PERSON>Acilius</PERSON> the consul, after he had subdued by his arms and counsels the power of king Antiochus.
 The ostentation of displaying, of magnifying perhaps, the rent roll of the estates which they possess in all the provinces, from the rising to the setting sun, provokes the just resentment of every man who recollects that their poor and invincible ancestors were not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers by the delicacy of their food or the splendour of their apparel.
 But the modern nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the loftiness of their chariots,(37) and the weighty magnificence of their dress.
 Their long robes of silk and purple float in the wind; and as they are agitated, by art or accident, they occasionally discover the under garments, the rich tunics, embroidered with the figures of various animals.
 (38) Followed by a train of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> servants, and tearing up the pavement, they move along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they travelled with post-horses and the example of the senators is boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies, whose covered carriages are continually driving round the immense space of the city and suburbs.
 Whenever these persons of high distinction condescend to visit the public baths, they assume, on their entrance, a tone of loud and insolent command, and appropriate to their own use the conveniences which were designed for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 If, in these places of mixed and general resort, they meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures, they express their affection by a tender embrace, while they proudly decline the salutations of their fellow-citizens, who are not permitted to aspire above the honour of kissing their hands or their knees.
 As soon as they have indulged themselves in the refreshment of the bath, they resume their rings and the other ensigns of their dignity, select from their private wardrobe of the finest linen, such as might suffice for a dozen persons, the garments the most agreeable to their fancy, and maintain till their departure the same haughty demeanour, which perhaps might have been excused in the great <PERSON>Marcellus</PERSON> after the conquest of Syracuse.
 Sometimes indeed these heroes undertake more arduous achievements: they visit their estates in Italy, and procure themselves, by the toil of servile hands, the amusements of the chase.
 (39) If at any time, but more especially on a hot day, they have courage to sail in their painted galleys from the Lucrine lake (40) to their elegant villas on the seacoast of <LOC>Puteoli</LOC> and Caieta, (41) they compare their own expeditions to the marches of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Alexander.
 Yet should a fly presume to settle on the silken folds of their gilded umbrellas, should a sunbeam penetrate through some unguarded and imperceptible chink, they deplore their intolerable hardships, and lament in affected language that they were not born in the land of the Cimmerians, (42) the regions of eternal darkness.
 In these journeys into the country (43) the whole body of the household marches with their master.
 In the same manner as the cavalry and infantry, the heavy and the light armed troops, the advanced guard and the rear, are marshalled by the skill of their military leaders, so the domestic officers, who bear a rod as an ensign of authority, distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves and attendants.
 The baggage and wardrobe move in the front, and are immediately followed by a multitude of cooks and inferior ministers employed in the service of the kitchens and of the table.
 The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of slaves, increased by the accidental concourse of idle or dependent plebeians.
 The rear is closed by the favourite band of eunuchs, distributed from age to youth, according to the order of seniority.
 Their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of the indignant spectators, who are ready to execrate the memory of <NORP>Semiramis</NORP> for the cruel art which she invented of frustrating the purposes of nature, and of blasting in the bud the hopes of future generations.
 In the exercise of domestic jurisdiction the nobles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> express an exquisite sensibility for any personal injury, and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human species.
 When they have called for warm water, if a slave has been tardy in his obedience, he is instantly chastised with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> lashes; but should the same slave commit a wilful murder, the master will mildly observe that he is a worthless fellow, but that if he repeats the offence he shall not escape punishment.
 Hospitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans; and every stranger who could plead either merit or misfortune was relieved or rewarded by their generosity.
 At present, if a foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the proud and wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> audience with such warm professions and such kind inquiries, that he retires enchanted with the affability of his illustrious friend, and full of regret that he had so long delayed his journey to Rome, the native seat of manners as well as of empire.
 Secure of a favourable reception, he repeats his visit the ensuing day, and is mortified by the discovery that his person, his name, and his country are already forgotten.
 If he still has resolution to persevere, he is gradually numbered in the train of dependents, and obtains the permission to pay his assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty patron, incapable of gratitude or friendship, who scarcely deigns remark his presence, his departure, or his return.
 Whenever the rich prepare a solemn and popular entertainment, (44) whenever they celebrate with profuse and pernicious luxury their private banquets, the choice of the guests is the subject of anxious deliberation.
 The modest, the sober, and the learned are seldom preferred and the nomenclators, who are commonly swayed by interested motives, have the address to insert in the list of invitations the obscure names of the most worthless of mankind.
 But the frequent and familiar companions of the great are those parasites who practise the most useful of all arts, the art of flattery; who eagerly applaud each word and every action of their immortal patron; gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated pavements, and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit.
 At the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tables the birds, the squirrels, (45) or the fish, which appear of an uncommon size are contemplated with curious attention; a pair of scales is accurately applied to ascertain their real weight and, while the more rational guests are disgusted by the vain and tedious repetition, notaries are summoned to attest by an authentic record the truth of such a marvellous event.
 Another method of introduction into the houses and society of the great is derived from the profession of gaming, or, as it is more politely styled, of play.
 The confederates are united by a strict and indissoluble bond of friendship, or rather of conspiracy; a superior degree of skill in the <NORP>Tesserarian</NORP> art (which may be interpreted the game of dice and tables (46)) is a sure road to wealth and reputation.
 A master of that sublime science, who in a supper or assembly is placed below a magistrate, displays in his countenance the surprise and indignation which <PERSON>Cato</PERSON> might be supposed to feel when he was refused the praetorship by the votes of a capricious people.
 The acquisition of knowledge seldom engages the curiosity of the nobles, who abhor the fatigue and disdain the advantages of study; and the only books which they peruse are the Satires of Juvenal, and the verbose and fabulous histories of Marius Maximus.
 (47) The libraries which they have inherited from their fathers are secluded, like dreary sepulchres, from the light of day.
 (48) But the costly instruments of the theatre, flutes, and enormous lyres, and hydraulic organs, are constructed for their use; and the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly repeated in the palaces of Rome.
 In those palaces sound is preferred to sense, and the care of the body to that of the mind.
 It is allowed as a salutary maxim, that the light and frivolous suspicion of a contagious malady is of sufficient weight to excuse the visits of the most intimate friends; and even the servants who are despatched to make the decent inquiries are not suffered to return home till they have undergone the ceremony of a previous ablution.
 Yet this selfish and unmanly delicacy occasionally yields to the more imperious passion of avarice.
 The prospect of gain will urge a rich and gouty senator as far as Spoleto; every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is subdued by the hopes of an inheritance, or even of a legacy; and a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the Romans.
 The art of obtaining the signature of a favourable testament, and sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution, is perfectly understood; and it has happened that in the same house, though in different apartments, a husband and a wife, with the laudable design of over-reaching each other, have summoned their respective lawyers, to declare at the same time their mutual but contradictory intentions.
 The distress which follows and chastises extravagant luxury often reduces the great to the use of the most humiliating expedients.
 When they desire to borrow, they employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the comedy; but when they are called upon to pay, they assume the royal and tragic declamation of the grandsons of Hercules.
 If the demand is repeated, they readily procure some trusty sycophant, instructed to maintain a charge of poison, or magic, against the insolent creditor, who is seldom released from prison till he has signed a discharge of the whole debt.
 These vices, which degrade the moral character of the Romans, are mixed with a puerile superstition that disgraces their understanding.
 They listen with confidence to the predictions of haruspices, who pretend to read in the entrails of victims the signs of future greatness and prosperity; and there are many who do not presume either to bathe or to dine, or to appear in public, till they have diligently consulted, according to the rules of astrology, the situation of <LOC>Mercury</LOC> and the aspect of the moon.
 (49) It is singular enough that this vain credulity may often be discovered among the profane sceptics who impiously doubt or deny the existence of a celestial power.
" State and character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people In populous cities, which are the seat of commerce and manufactures, the middle ranks of inhabitants, who derive their subsistence from the dexterity or labour of their hands, are commonly the most prolific, the most useful, and; in that sense, the most respectable part of the community.
 But the plebeians of Rome, who disdained such sedentary and servile arts, had been oppressed from the earliest times by the weight of debt and usury, and the husbandman, during the term of his military service, was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm.
 (50) The lands of Italy, which had been originally divided among the families of free and indigent proprietors, were insensibly purchased or usurped by the avarice of the nobles; and in the age which preceded the fall of the republic, it was computed that only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> citizens were possessed of any independent substance.
(51) Yet as long as the people bestowed by their suffrages the honours of the state, the command of the legions, and the administration of wealthy provinces, their conscious pride alleviated in some measure the hardships of poverty and their wants were seasonably supplied by the ambitious liberality of the candidates, who aspired to secure a venal majority in the <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> tribes, or the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and ninety-three centuries, of Rome.
 But when the prodigal commons had imprudently alienated not only the use, but the inheritance, of power, they sunk, under the reign of the Caesars, into a vile and wretched populace, which must, in a few generations, have been totally extinguished, if it had not been continually recruited by the manumission of slaves and the influx of strangers.
 As early as the time of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> it was the just complaint of the ingenuous natives that the capital had attracted the vices of the universe and the manners of the most opposite nations.
 The intemperance of the Gauls, the cunning and levity of the Greeks, the savage obstinacy of the <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> and Jews, the servile temper of the Asiatics, and the dissolute, effeminate prostitution of the Syrians, were mingled in the various multitude, which, under the proud and false denomination of Romans, presumed to despise their fellow-subjects, and even their sovereigns, who dwelt beyond the precincts of the ETERNAL CITY.
(52) Public distribution of bread, bacon, oil, wine, etc Yet the name of that city was still pronounced with respect: the frequent and capricious tumults of its inhabitants were indulged with impunity; and the successors of Constantine, instead of crushing the last remains of the democracy by the strong arm of military power, embraced the mild policy of Augustus, and studied to relieve the poverty and to amuse the idleness of an innumerable people.
 (53)I.
 For the convenience of the lazy plebeians, the monthly distributions of corn were converted into a <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of bread; a great number of ovens were constructed and maintained at the public expense; and at the appointed hour, each citizen, who was furnished with a ticket, ascended the flight of steps which had been assigned to his peculiar <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> or division, and received, either as a gift or at a very low price, a loaf of bread of the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds for the use of his family.
 II.
The forests of Lucania, whose acorns fattened large droves of wild hogs, (54) afforded, as a species of tribute, a plentiful supply of cheap and wholesome meat.
 During <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months of the year a regular allowance of bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens; and the annual consumption of the capital, at a time when it was much declined from its former lustre, was ascertained, by an edict of Valentinian the Third, at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds.
 (55) III.
In the manners of antiquity the use of oil was indispensable for the lamp as well as for the bath, and the annual tax which was imposed on <LOC>Africa</LOC> for the benefit of <GPE>Rome</GPE> amounted to the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions of pounds, to the measure, perhaps, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> English gallons.
 IV.
 The anxiety of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to provide the metropolis with sufficient plenty of corn was not extended beyond that necessary article of human subsistence; and when the popular clamour accused the dearness and scarcity of wine, a proclamation was issued by the grave reformer to remind his subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst, since the aqueducts of <PERSON>Agrippa</PERSON> had introduced into the city so many copious streams of pure and salubrious water.
(56) This rigid sobriety was insensibly relaxed; and, although the generous design of Aurelian(57) does not appear to have been executed in its full extent, the use of wine was allowed on very easy and liberal terms.
 The administration of the public cellars was delegated to a magistrate of honourable rank; and a considerable part of the vintage of <GPE>Campania</GPE> was reserved for the fortunate inhabitants of Rome.
 Use of the public baths.
 The stupendous aqueducts, so justly celebrated by the praises of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> himself, replenished the Thermae, or baths, which had been constructed in every part of the city with <NORP>Imperial</NORP> magnificence.
 The baths of Antoninus Caracalla, which were open, at stated hours, for the indiscriminate service of the senators and the people, contained above sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> seats of marble; and more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> were reckoned in the baths of Diocletian.
 (58) The walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious mosaics, that imitated the art of the pencil in the elegance of design and the variety of colours.
 The <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> granite was beautifully encrusted with the precious green marble of Numidia; the perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the capacious basins through so many wide mouths of bright and massy silver; and the meanest <NORP>Roman</NORP> could purchase, with a small copper coin, the <DATE>daily</DATE> enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury which might excite the envy of the kings of Asia.
(59) From these stately palaces issued a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians, without shoes and without a mantle; who loitered away whole days in the street or <ORG>Forum</ORG> to hear news and to hold disputes who dissipated in extravagant gaming the miserable pittance of their wives and children; and spent the <TIME>hours</TIME> of the night in obscure taverns and brothels in the indulgence of gross and vulgar sensuality.
(60) Games and spectacles But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles.
 The piety of <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people still considered the <FAC>Circus</FAC> as their home, their temple, and the seat of the republic.
 The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secure their places, and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos.
 From the morning to the evening, careless of the sun or of the rain, the spectators, who sometimes amounted to the number of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand, remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the colours which they espoused; and the happiness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> appeared to hang on the event of a race.
 (61) The same immoderate ardour inspired their clamours and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation.
 These representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste, and perhaps of virtue.
 But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans, who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius,(62) had been almost totally silent since the fall of the republic; (63) and their place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and splendid pageantry.
 The pantomimes, (64) who maintained their reputation from the age of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century, expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people.
 The vast and magnificent theatres of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were filled by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> female dancers, and by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> singers, with the masters of the respective choruses.
 Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed, that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts.
(65) Populous of <GPE>Rome</GPE> It is said that the foolish curiosity of <GPE>Elagabalus</GPE> attempted to discover, from the quantity of spiders' webs, the number of the inhabitants of Rome.
 A more rational method of inquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who could easily have resolved a question so important for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government and so interesting to succeeding ages.
 The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the common average, we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which should destroy the extravagant assertions of critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers.
(66) The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances, which, slight and imperfect as they are, may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome.
 I.
 When the capital of the empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal to twenty-one miles.
(67) It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle, the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference.
 II.
 The architect Vitruvius, who flourished in the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, observes that the innumerable habitations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air.
 (68) But the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the walls of <GPE>Rome</GPE> should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground.
(69) III.
 <PERSON>Juvenal</PERSON> (70) laments, as it should seem from his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay, from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase in the little towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> a cheerful, commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
 House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces and gardens; but the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was crowded into a narrow space; and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided, as it is still the custom of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and other cities, among several families of plebeians.
 IV.
 The total number of houses in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of <GPE>Rome</GPE> composed under the reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-two.
(71) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes of domus and of insulae, into which they are divided, include all the habitations of the capital, of every rank and condition, from the marble palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodginghouse where the poet <PERSON>Codrus</PERSON> and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the tiles.
 If we adopt the same average which, under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris,(72) and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand: a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe.
(73) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> seige of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408.
 Such was the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> under the reign of Honorius, at the time when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
 (74) By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an assault, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> encompassed the walls, commanded the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tiber, from which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world; but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim.
 Perhaps in the person of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor; they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 Actuated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city.
 That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine.
 Famine.
 The <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion.
 The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband.
(75) But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves.
 The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain.
 The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger.
 A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers (such was the horrid conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast), even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants!(76)Plague.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy, the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease.
 The assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported, for some time, the fainting resolution of the Romans, Superstition.
 till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a preternatural deliverance.
 Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or fanaticism of some <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> diviners, that, by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians.
(77) The important secret was communicated to Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St.
 Peter is accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates; the majority of that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> displeasure, refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism.
(78) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, "If such, O king! are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?" "YOUR LIVES," replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.

 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> marches to Rome, A.
D.
 408, October, etc In the arts of negotiation, as well as in those of war, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king maintained his superior ascendant over an enemy whose seeming changes proceeded from the total want of counsel and design.
 From his camp, on the confines of Italy, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> attentively observed the revolutions of the palace, watched the progress of faction and discontent, disguised the hostile aspect of a barbarian invader, and assumed the more popular appearance of the friend and ally of the great Stilicho; to whose virtues, when they were no longer formidable, he could pay a just tribute of sincere praise and regret.
 The pressing invitation of the malcontents, who urged the king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> to invade Italy, was enforced by a lively sense of his personal injuries; and he might speciously complain that the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers still delayed and eluded the payment of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold which had been granted by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate either to reward his services or to appease his fury.
 His decent firmness was supported by an artful moderation, which contributed to the success of his designs.
 He required a fair and reasonable satisfaction; but he gave the strongest assurances that, as soon as he had obtained it, he would immediately retire.
 He refused to trust the faith of the Romans, unless <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> and Jason, the sons of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great officers of state, were sent as hostages to his camp: but he offered to deliver in exchange several of the noblest youths of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation.
 The modesty of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was interpreted by the ministers of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> as a sure evidence of his weakness and fear.
 They disdained either to negotiate a treaty or to assemble an army and with a rash confidence, derived only from their ignorance of the extreme danger, irretrievably wasted the decisive moments of peace and war.
 While they expected, in sullen silence, that the barbarians should evacuate the confines of Italy, Alaric, with bold and rapid marches, passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and the Po; hastily pillaged the cities of Aquileia, Altinum, Concordia, and Cremona, which yielded to his arms; increased his forces by the accession of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> auxiliaries, and without meeting a single enemy in the field, advanced as far as the edge of the morass which protected the impregnable residence of the emperor of the West.
 Instead of attempting the hopeless siege of Ravenna, the prudent leader of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> proceeded to Rimini, stretched his ravages along the sea-coast of the Hadriatic, and meditated the conquest of the ancient mistress of the world.
 An <NORP>Italian</NORP> hermit, whose zeal and sanctity were respected by the barbarians themselves, encountered the victorious monarch, and boldly denounced the indignation of Heaven against the oppressors of the earth: but the saint himself was confounded by the solemn asseveration of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> that he felt a secret and preternatural impulse, which directed, and even compelled, his march to the gates of <GPE>Rome</GPE> He felt that his genius and his fortune were equal to the most arduous enterprises; and the enthusiasm which he communicated to the <NORP>Goths</NORP> insensibly removed the popular and almost superstitious reverence of the nations for the majesty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name.
 His troops, animated by the hopes of spoil, followed the course of the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way, occupied the unguarded passes of the Apennine,(4) descended into the rich plains of Umbria; and, as they lay encamped on the banks of the Clitumnus, might wantonly slaughter and devour the milk-white oxen which had been so long reserved for the use of <NORP>Roman</NORP> triumphs.
(5) A lofty situation and a seasonable tempest of thunder and lightning preserved the little city of Narni: but the king of the Goths, despising the ignoble prey, still advanced with unabated vigour; and after he had passed through the stately arches, adorned with the spoils of barbaric victories, he pitched his camp under the walls of Rome.
(6) <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> at the gates of <GPE>Rome</GPE> During a period of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and nineteen years the seat of empire had never been violated by the presence of a foreign enemy.
 The unsuccessful expedition of Hannibal(7) served only to display the character of the senate and people; of a senate degraded, rather than ennobled, by the comparison of an assembly of kings; and of a people to whom the ambassador of <PERSON>Pyrrhus</PERSON> ascribed the inexhaustible resources of the Hydra.
 (8) Each of the senators in the time of the Punic war had accomplished his term of military service, either in a subordinate or a superior station; and the decree which invested with temporary command all those who had been consuls, or censors, or dictators, gave the republic the immediate assistance of many brave and experienced generals.
 In the beginning of the war the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people consisted of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> citizens of an age to bear arms.
(9) <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> had already died in the defence of their country; and the <CARDINAL>twenty-three</CARDINAL> legions which were employed in the different camps of Italy, Greece, Sardinia, Sicily, and Spain, required about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men.
 But there still remained an equal number in <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the adjacent territory who were animated by the same intrepid courage; and every citizen was trained from his earliest youth in the discipline and exercises of a soldier.
 <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> was astonished by the constancy of the senate, who, without raising the siege of <LOC>Capua</LOC> or recalling their scattered forces, expected his approach.
 He encamped on the banks of the Anio, at the distance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles from the city: and he was soon informed that the ground on which he had pitched his tent was sold for an adequate price at a public auction; and that a body of troops was dismissed by an opposite road to reinforce the legions of Spain.
(10) He led his <NORP>Africans</NORP> to the gates of Rome, where he found <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> armies in order of battle prepared to receive him; but <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> dreaded the event of a combat from which he could not hope to escape unless he destroyed the last of his enemies; and his speedy retreat confessed the invincible courage of the Romans.
 Genealogy of the senators From the time of the Punic war the uninterrupted succession of senators had preserved the name and image of the republic; and the degenerate subjects of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> ambitiously derived their descent from the heroes who had repulsed the arms of <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> and subdued the nations of the earth.
 The temporal honours which the devout <PERSON>Paula</PERSON> (11) inherited and despised are carefully recapitulated by Jerom, the guide of her conscience and the historian of her life.
 The genealogy of her father, Rogatus, which ascended as high as Agamemnon, might seem to betray a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> origin; but her mother, Blasilla, numbered the Scipios, Amilius Paulus, and the <PERSON>Gracchi</PERSON> in the list of her ancestors; and Toxotius, the husband of Paula, deduced his royal lineage from Aeneas, the father of the <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> line.
 The vanity of the rich, who desired to be noble, was gratified by these lofty pretensions.
 Encouraged by the applause of their parasites, they easily imposed on the credulity of the vulgar; and were countenanced in some measure by the custom of adopting the name of their patron, which had always prevailed among the freedmen and clients of illustrious families.
 Most of those families, however, attacked by so many causes of external violence or internal decay, were gradually extirpated: and it would be more reasonable to seek for a lineal descent of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> generations among the mountains of the <LOC>Alps</LOC> or in the peaceful solitude of Apulia, than on the theatre of Rome, the seat of fortune, of danger, and of perpetual revolutions.
 Under each successive reign and from every province of the empire a crowd of hardy adventurers, rising to eminence by their talents or their vices, usurped the wealth, the honours, and the palaces of Rome; and oppressed or protected the poor and humble remains of consular families, who were ignorant, perhaps, of the glory of their ancestors.
(12) The <NORP>Anician</NORP> family In the time of <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> the senators unanimously yielded the pre-eminence to the <NORP>Anician</NORP> line; and a slight view of their history will serve to appreciate the rank and antiquity of the noble families which contended only for the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> place.
(13) During the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ages of the city the name of the <PERSON>Anicians</PERSON> was unknown; they appear to have derived their origin from Praeneste; and the ambition of those new citizens was long satisfied with the plebeian honours of tribunes of the people.
(14) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-eight years before the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era the family was ennobled by the praetorship of Anicius, who gloriously terminated the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> war by the conquest of the nation and the captivity of their king.
 (15) From the triumph of that general <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> consulships in distant periods mark the succession of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> name.
(16) From the reign of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> to the final extinction of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire that name shone with a lustre which was not eclipsed in the public estimation by the majesty of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple.
(17) The several branches to whom it was communicated united, by marriage or inheritance, the wealth and titles of the Annian, the Petronian, and the <NORP>Olybrian</NORP> houses; and in each generation the number of consulships was multiplied by an hereditary claim.
(18) The <NORP>Anician</NORP> family excelled in faith and in riches: they were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate who embraced <NORP>Christianity</NORP> and it is probable that <PERSON>Anicius</PERSON> Julian, who was afterwards consul and praefect of the city, atoned for his attachment to the party of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> by the readiness with which he accepted the religion of Constantine.
 (19) Their ample patrimony was increased by the industry of Probus, the chief of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, who shared with <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> the honours of the consulship, and exercised <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> times the high office of <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect.
 (20) His immense estates were scattered over the wide extent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; and though the public might suspect or disapprove the methods by which they had been acquired, the generosity and magnificence of that fortunate statesman deserved the gratitude of his clients and the admiration of strangers.
(21) Such was the respect entertained for his memory, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons of Probus, in their earliest youth and at the request of the senate, were associated in the consular dignity: a memorable distinction, without example in the annals of Rome.
(22) Wealth of <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles.
 "The marbles of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> palace," were used as a proverbial expression of opulence and splendour;(23) but the nobles and senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> aspired in due gradation to imitate that illustrious family.
 The accurate description of the city, which was composed in the <GPE>Theodosian</GPE> age, enumerates <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty houses, the residence of wealthy and honourable citizens.
 (24) Many of these stately mansions might almost excuse the exaggeration of the poet—that <GPE>Rome</GPE> contained a multitude of palaces, and that each palace was equal to a city, since it included within its own precincts everything which could be subservient either to use or luxury: markets, hippodromes, temples, fountains, baths, porticos, shady groves, and artificial aviaries.
(25) The historian Olympiodorus, who represents the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> when it was besieged by the Goths,(26) continues to observe that several of the richest senators received from their estates an annual income of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling; without computing the stated provision of corn and wine, which, had they been sold, might have equalled in value <CARDINAL>one-third</CARDINAL> of the money.
 Compared to this immoderate wealth, an ordinary revenue of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds of gold might be considered as no more than adequate to the dignity of the <NORP>senatorian</NORP> rank, which required many expenses of a public and ostentatious kind.
 Several examples are recorded in the age of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> of vain and popular nobles who celebrated the year of their praetorship by a festival which lasted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days and cost above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling.
(27) The estates of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, which so far exceed the proportion of modern wealth, were not confined to the limits of Italy.
 Their possessions extended far beyond the <NORP>Ionian</NORP> and <NORP>Agean</NORP> seas to the most distant provinces: the city of Nicopolis, which <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> had founded as an eternal monument of the <NORP>Actian</NORP> victory, was the property of the devout Paula;(28) and it is observed by Seneca, that the rivers which had divided hostile nations now flowed through the lands of private citizens.
(29) According to their temper and circumstances, the estates of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were either cultivated by the labour of their slaves, or granted, for a certain and stipulated rent, to the industrious farmer.
 The economical writers of antiquity strenuously recommend the former method wherever it may be practicable but if the object should be removed by its distance or magnitude from the immediate eye of the master, they prefer the active care of an old hereditary tenant, attached to the soil and interested in the produce, to the mercenary administration of a negligent, perhaps an unfaithful steward.
(30) Their manners The opulent nobles of an immense capital, who were never excited by the pursuit of military glory, and seldom engaged in the occupations of civil government, naturally resigned their leisure to the business and amusements of private life.
 At <GPE>Rome</GPE> commerce was always held in contempt; but the senators, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age of the republic, increased their patrimony and multiplied their clients by the lucrative practice of usury, and the obsolete laws were eluded or violated by the mutual inclinations and interest of both parties.
 (31) A considerable mass of treasure must always have existed at Rome, either in the current coin of the empire, or in the form of gold and silver plate; and there were many sideboards in the time of Pliny which contained more solid silver than had been transported by <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> from vanquished Carthage.
(32) The greater part of the nobles, who dissipated their fortunes in profuse luxury, found themselves poor in the midst of wealth, and idle in a constant round of dissipation.
 Their desires were continually gratified by the labour of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> hands; of the numerous train of their domestic slaves, who were actuated by the fear of punishment; and of the various professions of artificers and merchants, who were more powerfully impelled by the hopes of gain.
 The ancients were destitute of many of the conveniences of life which have been invented or improved by the progress of industry; and the plenty of glass and linen has diffused more real comforts among the modern nations of <LOC>Europe</LOC> than the senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> could derive from all the refinements of pompous or sensual luxury.
(33) Their luxury and their manners have been the subject of minute and laborious disquisition; but as such inquiries would divert me too long from the design of the present work, I shall produce an authentic state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and its inhabitants which is more peculiarly applicable to the period of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion.
 <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus, who prudently chose the capital of the empire as the residence the best adapted to the historian of his own times, has mixed with the narrative of public events a lively representation of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant.
 The judicious reader will not always approve the asperity of censure, the choice of circumstances, or the style of expression; he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices and personal resentments which soured the temper of <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> himself; but he will surely observe, with philosophic curiosity, the interesting and original picture of the manners of Rome.
(34) Character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles, by <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus "The greatness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> (such is the language of the historian) was founded on the rare and almost incredible alliance of virtue and of fortune.
 The long period of her infancy was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of Italy, the neighbours and enemies of the rising city.
 In the strength and ardour of youth she sustained the storms of war, carried her victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains, and brought home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe.
 At length, verging towards old age, and sometimes conquering by the terror only of her name, she sought the blessings of ease and tranquillity.
 The VENERABLE CITY, which had trampled on the necks of the fiercest nations, and established a system of laws, the perpetual guardians of justice and freedom, was content, like a wise and wealthy parent, to devolve on the Caesars, her favourite sons, the care of governing her ample patrimony.
 (35) A secure and profound peace, such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of Numa, succeeded to the tumults of a republic; while <GPE>Rome</GPE> was still adored as the queen of the earth, and the subject nations still reverenced the name of the people and the majesty of the senate.
 But this native splendour (continues Ammianus) is degraded and sullied by the conduct of some nobles, who, unmindful of their own dignity and of that of their country, assume an unbounded licence of vice and folly.
 They contend with each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames, and curiously select or invent the most lofty and sonorous appellations — <PERSON>Reburrus</PERSON> or Fabunius, <PERSON>Pagonius</PERSON> or <PERSON>Tarrasius</PERSON> (36) which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and respect.
 From a vain ambition of perpetuating their memory, they affect to multiply their likeness in statues of bronze and marble; nor are they satisfied unless those statues are covered with plates of gold; an honourable distinction, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> granted to <PERSON>Acilius</PERSON> the consul, after he had subdued by his arms and counsels the power of king Antiochus.
 The ostentation of displaying, of magnifying perhaps, the rent roll of the estates which they possess in all the provinces, from the rising to the setting sun, provokes the just resentment of every man who recollects that their poor and invincible ancestors were not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers by the delicacy of their food or the splendour of their apparel.
 But the modern nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the loftiness of their chariots,(37) and the weighty magnificence of their dress.
 Their long robes of silk and purple float in the wind; and as they are agitated, by art or accident, they occasionally discover the under garments, the rich tunics, embroidered with the figures of various animals.
 (38) Followed by a train of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> servants, and tearing up the pavement, they move along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they travelled with post-horses and the example of the senators is boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies, whose covered carriages are continually driving round the immense space of the city and suburbs.
 Whenever these persons of high distinction condescend to visit the public baths, they assume, on their entrance, a tone of loud and insolent command, and appropriate to their own use the conveniences which were designed for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 If, in these places of mixed and general resort, they meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures, they express their affection by a tender embrace, while they proudly decline the salutations of their fellow-citizens, who are not permitted to aspire above the honour of kissing their hands or their knees.
 As soon as they have indulged themselves in the refreshment of the bath, they resume their rings and the other ensigns of their dignity, select from their private wardrobe of the finest linen, such as might suffice for a dozen persons, the garments the most agreeable to their fancy, and maintain till their departure the same haughty demeanour, which perhaps might have been excused in the great <PERSON>Marcellus</PERSON> after the conquest of Syracuse.
 Sometimes indeed these heroes undertake more arduous achievements: they visit their estates in Italy, and procure themselves, by the toil of servile hands, the amusements of the chase.
 (39) If at any time, but more especially on a hot day, they have courage to sail in their painted galleys from the Lucrine lake (40) to their elegant villas on the seacoast of <LOC>Puteoli</LOC> and Caieta, (41) they compare their own expeditions to the marches of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Alexander.
 Yet should a fly presume to settle on the silken folds of their gilded umbrellas, should a sunbeam penetrate through some unguarded and imperceptible chink, they deplore their intolerable hardships, and lament in affected language that they were not born in the land of the Cimmerians, (42) the regions of eternal darkness.
 In these journeys into the country (43) the whole body of the household marches with their master.
 In the same manner as the cavalry and infantry, the heavy and the light armed troops, the advanced guard and the rear, are marshalled by the skill of their military leaders, so the domestic officers, who bear a rod as an ensign of authority, distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves and attendants.
 The baggage and wardrobe move in the front, and are immediately followed by a multitude of cooks and inferior ministers employed in the service of the kitchens and of the table.
 The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of slaves, increased by the accidental concourse of idle or dependent plebeians.
 The rear is closed by the favourite band of eunuchs, distributed from age to youth, according to the order of seniority.
 Their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of the indignant spectators, who are ready to execrate the memory of <NORP>Semiramis</NORP> for the cruel art which she invented of frustrating the purposes of nature, and of blasting in the bud the hopes of future generations.
 In the exercise of domestic jurisdiction the nobles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> express an exquisite sensibility for any personal injury, and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human species.
 When they have called for warm water, if a slave has been tardy in his obedience, he is instantly chastised with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> lashes; but should the same slave commit a wilful murder, the master will mildly observe that he is a worthless fellow, but that if he repeats the offence he shall not escape punishment.
 Hospitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans; and every stranger who could plead either merit or misfortune was relieved or rewarded by their generosity.
 At present, if a foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the proud and wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> audience with such warm professions and such kind inquiries, that he retires enchanted with the affability of his illustrious friend, and full of regret that he had so long delayed his journey to Rome, the native seat of manners as well as of empire.
 Secure of a favourable reception, he repeats his visit the ensuing day, and is mortified by the discovery that his person, his name, and his country are already forgotten.
 If he still has resolution to persevere, he is gradually numbered in the train of dependents, and obtains the permission to pay his assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty patron, incapable of gratitude or friendship, who scarcely deigns remark his presence, his departure, or his return.
 Whenever the rich prepare a solemn and popular entertainment, (44) whenever they celebrate with profuse and pernicious luxury their private banquets, the choice of the guests is the subject of anxious deliberation.
 The modest, the sober, and the learned are seldom preferred and the nomenclators, who are commonly swayed by interested motives, have the address to insert in the list of invitations the obscure names of the most worthless of mankind.
 But the frequent and familiar companions of the great are those parasites who practise the most useful of all arts, the art of flattery; who eagerly applaud each word and every action of their immortal patron; gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated pavements, and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit.
 At the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tables the birds, the squirrels, (45) or the fish, which appear of an uncommon size are contemplated with curious attention; a pair of scales is accurately applied to ascertain their real weight and, while the more rational guests are disgusted by the vain and tedious repetition, notaries are summoned to attest by an authentic record the truth of such a marvellous event.
 Another method of introduction into the houses and society of the great is derived from the profession of gaming, or, as it is more politely styled, of play.
 The confederates are united by a strict and indissoluble bond of friendship, or rather of conspiracy; a superior degree of skill in the <NORP>Tesserarian</NORP> art (which may be interpreted the game of dice and tables (46)) is a sure road to wealth and reputation.
 A master of that sublime science, who in a supper or assembly is placed below a magistrate, displays in his countenance the surprise and indignation which <PERSON>Cato</PERSON> might be supposed to feel when he was refused the praetorship by the votes of a capricious people.
 The acquisition of knowledge seldom engages the curiosity of the nobles, who abhor the fatigue and disdain the advantages of study; and the only books which they peruse are the Satires of Juvenal, and the verbose and fabulous histories of Marius Maximus.
 (47) The libraries which they have inherited from their fathers are secluded, like dreary sepulchres, from the light of day.
 (48) But the costly instruments of the theatre, flutes, and enormous lyres, and hydraulic organs, are constructed for their use; and the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly repeated in the palaces of Rome.
 In those palaces sound is preferred to sense, and the care of the body to that of the mind.
 It is allowed as a salutary maxim, that the light and frivolous suspicion of a contagious malady is of sufficient weight to excuse the visits of the most intimate friends; and even the servants who are despatched to make the decent inquiries are not suffered to return home till they have undergone the ceremony of a previous ablution.
 Yet this selfish and unmanly delicacy occasionally yields to the more imperious passion of avarice.
 The prospect of gain will urge a rich and gouty senator as far as Spoleto; every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is subdued by the hopes of an inheritance, or even of a legacy; and a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the Romans.
 The art of obtaining the signature of a favourable testament, and sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution, is perfectly understood; and it has happened that in the same house, though in different apartments, a husband and a wife, with the laudable design of over-reaching each other, have summoned their respective lawyers, to declare at the same time their mutual but contradictory intentions.
 The distress which follows and chastises extravagant luxury often reduces the great to the use of the most humiliating expedients.
 When they desire to borrow, they employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the comedy; but when they are called upon to pay, they assume the royal and tragic declamation of the grandsons of Hercules.
 If the demand is repeated, they readily procure some trusty sycophant, instructed to maintain a charge of poison, or magic, against the insolent creditor, who is seldom released from prison till he has signed a discharge of the whole debt.
 These vices, which degrade the moral character of the Romans, are mixed with a puerile superstition that disgraces their understanding.
 They listen with confidence to the predictions of haruspices, who pretend to read in the entrails of victims the signs of future greatness and prosperity; and there are many who do not presume either to bathe or to dine, or to appear in public, till they have diligently consulted, according to the rules of astrology, the situation of <LOC>Mercury</LOC> and the aspect of the moon.
 (49) It is singular enough that this vain credulity may often be discovered among the profane sceptics who impiously doubt or deny the existence of a celestial power.
" State and character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people In populous cities, which are the seat of commerce and manufactures, the middle ranks of inhabitants, who derive their subsistence from the dexterity or labour of their hands, are commonly the most prolific, the most useful, and; in that sense, the most respectable part of the community.
 But the plebeians of Rome, who disdained such sedentary and servile arts, had been oppressed from the earliest times by the weight of debt and usury, and the husbandman, during the term of his military service, was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm.
 (50) The lands of Italy, which had been originally divided among the families of free and indigent proprietors, were insensibly purchased or usurped by the avarice of the nobles; and in the age which preceded the fall of the republic, it was computed that only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> citizens were possessed of any independent substance.
(51) Yet as long as the people bestowed by their suffrages the honours of the state, the command of the legions, and the administration of wealthy provinces, their conscious pride alleviated in some measure the hardships of poverty and their wants were seasonably supplied by the ambitious liberality of the candidates, who aspired to secure a venal majority in the <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> tribes, or the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and ninety-three centuries, of Rome.
 But when the prodigal commons had imprudently alienated not only the use, but the inheritance, of power, they sunk, under the reign of the Caesars, into a vile and wretched populace, which must, in a few generations, have been totally extinguished, if it had not been continually recruited by the manumission of slaves and the influx of strangers.
 As early as the time of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> it was the just complaint of the ingenuous natives that the capital had attracted the vices of the universe and the manners of the most opposite nations.
 The intemperance of the Gauls, the cunning and levity of the Greeks, the savage obstinacy of the <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> and Jews, the servile temper of the Asiatics, and the dissolute, effeminate prostitution of the Syrians, were mingled in the various multitude, which, under the proud and false denomination of Romans, presumed to despise their fellow-subjects, and even their sovereigns, who dwelt beyond the precincts of the ETERNAL CITY.
(52) Public distribution of bread, bacon, oil, wine, etc Yet the name of that city was still pronounced with respect: the frequent and capricious tumults of its inhabitants were indulged with impunity; and the successors of Constantine, instead of crushing the last remains of the democracy by the strong arm of military power, embraced the mild policy of Augustus, and studied to relieve the poverty and to amuse the idleness of an innumerable people.
 (53)I.
 For the convenience of the lazy plebeians, the monthly distributions of corn were converted into a <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of bread; a great number of ovens were constructed and maintained at the public expense; and at the appointed hour, each citizen, who was furnished with a ticket, ascended the flight of steps which had been assigned to his peculiar <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> or division, and received, either as a gift or at a very low price, a loaf of bread of the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds for the use of his family.
 II.
The forests of Lucania, whose acorns fattened large droves of wild hogs, (54) afforded, as a species of tribute, a plentiful supply of cheap and wholesome meat.
 During <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months of the year a regular allowance of bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens; and the annual consumption of the capital, at a time when it was much declined from its former lustre, was ascertained, by an edict of Valentinian the Third, at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds.
 (55) III.
In the manners of antiquity the use of oil was indispensable for the lamp as well as for the bath, and the annual tax which was imposed on <LOC>Africa</LOC> for the benefit of <GPE>Rome</GPE> amounted to the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions of pounds, to the measure, perhaps, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> English gallons.
 IV.
 The anxiety of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to provide the metropolis with sufficient plenty of corn was not extended beyond that necessary article of human subsistence; and when the popular clamour accused the dearness and scarcity of wine, a proclamation was issued by the grave reformer to remind his subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst, since the aqueducts of <PERSON>Agrippa</PERSON> had introduced into the city so many copious streams of pure and salubrious water.
(56) This rigid sobriety was insensibly relaxed; and, although the generous design of Aurelian(57) does not appear to have been executed in its full extent, the use of wine was allowed on very easy and liberal terms.
 The administration of the public cellars was delegated to a magistrate of honourable rank; and a considerable part of the vintage of <GPE>Campania</GPE> was reserved for the fortunate inhabitants of Rome.
 Use of the public baths.
 The stupendous aqueducts, so justly celebrated by the praises of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> himself, replenished the Thermae, or baths, which had been constructed in every part of the city with <NORP>Imperial</NORP> magnificence.
 The baths of Antoninus Caracalla, which were open, at stated hours, for the indiscriminate service of the senators and the people, contained above sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> seats of marble; and more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> were reckoned in the baths of Diocletian.
 (58) The walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious mosaics, that imitated the art of the pencil in the elegance of design and the variety of colours.
 The <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> granite was beautifully encrusted with the precious green marble of Numidia; the perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the capacious basins through so many wide mouths of bright and massy silver; and the meanest <NORP>Roman</NORP> could purchase, with a small copper coin, the <DATE>daily</DATE> enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury which might excite the envy of the kings of Asia.
(59) From these stately palaces issued a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians, without shoes and without a mantle; who loitered away whole days in the street or <ORG>Forum</ORG> to hear news and to hold disputes who dissipated in extravagant gaming the miserable pittance of their wives and children; and spent the <TIME>hours</TIME> of the night in obscure taverns and brothels in the indulgence of gross and vulgar sensuality.
(60) Games and spectacles But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles.
 The piety of <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people still considered the <FAC>Circus</FAC> as their home, their temple, and the seat of the republic.
 The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secure their places, and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos.
 From the morning to the evening, careless of the sun or of the rain, the spectators, who sometimes amounted to the number of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand, remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the colours which they espoused; and the happiness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> appeared to hang on the event of a race.
 (61) The same immoderate ardour inspired their clamours and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation.
 These representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste, and perhaps of virtue.
 But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans, who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius,(62) had been almost totally silent since the fall of the republic; (63) and their place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and splendid pageantry.
 The pantomimes, (64) who maintained their reputation from the age of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century, expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people.
 The vast and magnificent theatres of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were filled by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> female dancers, and by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> singers, with the masters of the respective choruses.
 Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed, that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts.
(65) Populous of <GPE>Rome</GPE> It is said that the foolish curiosity of <GPE>Elagabalus</GPE> attempted to discover, from the quantity of spiders' webs, the number of the inhabitants of Rome.
 A more rational method of inquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who could easily have resolved a question so important for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government and so interesting to succeeding ages.
 The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the common average, we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which should destroy the extravagant assertions of critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers.
(66) The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances, which, slight and imperfect as they are, may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome.
 I.
 When the capital of the empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal to twenty-one miles.
(67) It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle, the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference.
 II.
 The architect Vitruvius, who flourished in the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, observes that the innumerable habitations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air.
 (68) But the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the walls of <GPE>Rome</GPE> should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground.
(69) III.
 <PERSON>Juvenal</PERSON> (70) laments, as it should seem from his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay, from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase in the little towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> a cheerful, commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
 House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces and gardens; but the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was crowded into a narrow space; and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided, as it is still the custom of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and other cities, among several families of plebeians.
 IV.
 The total number of houses in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of <GPE>Rome</GPE> composed under the reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-two.
(71) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes of domus and of insulae, into which they are divided, include all the habitations of the capital, of every rank and condition, from the marble palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodginghouse where the poet <PERSON>Codrus</PERSON> and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the tiles.
 If we adopt the same average which, under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris,(72) and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand: a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe.
(73) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> seige of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408.
 Such was the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> under the reign of Honorius, at the time when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
 (74) By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an assault, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> encompassed the walls, commanded the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tiber, from which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world; but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim.
 Perhaps in the person of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor; they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 Actuated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city.
 That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine.
 Famine.
 The <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion.
 The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband.
(75) But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves.
 The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain.
 The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger.
 A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers (such was the horrid conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast), even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants!(76)Plague.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy, the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease.
 The assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported, for some time, the fainting resolution of the Romans, Superstition.
 till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a preternatural deliverance.
 Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or fanaticism of some <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> diviners, that, by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians.
(77) The important secret was communicated to Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St.
 Peter is accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates; the majority of that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> displeasure, refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism.
(78) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, "If such, O king! are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?" "YOUR LIVES," replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.

 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> at the gates of <GPE>Rome</GPE> During a period of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and nineteen years the seat of empire had never been violated by the presence of a foreign enemy.
 The unsuccessful expedition of Hannibal(7) served only to display the character of the senate and people; of a senate degraded, rather than ennobled, by the comparison of an assembly of kings; and of a people to whom the ambassador of <PERSON>Pyrrhus</PERSON> ascribed the inexhaustible resources of the Hydra.
 (8) Each of the senators in the time of the Punic war had accomplished his term of military service, either in a subordinate or a superior station; and the decree which invested with temporary command all those who had been consuls, or censors, or dictators, gave the republic the immediate assistance of many brave and experienced generals.
 In the beginning of the war the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people consisted of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> citizens of an age to bear arms.
(9) <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> had already died in the defence of their country; and the <CARDINAL>twenty-three</CARDINAL> legions which were employed in the different camps of Italy, Greece, Sardinia, Sicily, and Spain, required about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men.
 But there still remained an equal number in <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the adjacent territory who were animated by the same intrepid courage; and every citizen was trained from his earliest youth in the discipline and exercises of a soldier.
 <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> was astonished by the constancy of the senate, who, without raising the siege of <LOC>Capua</LOC> or recalling their scattered forces, expected his approach.
 He encamped on the banks of the Anio, at the distance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles from the city: and he was soon informed that the ground on which he had pitched his tent was sold for an adequate price at a public auction; and that a body of troops was dismissed by an opposite road to reinforce the legions of Spain.
(10) He led his <NORP>Africans</NORP> to the gates of Rome, where he found <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> armies in order of battle prepared to receive him; but <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> dreaded the event of a combat from which he could not hope to escape unless he destroyed the last of his enemies; and his speedy retreat confessed the invincible courage of the Romans.
 Genealogy of the senators From the time of the Punic war the uninterrupted succession of senators had preserved the name and image of the republic; and the degenerate subjects of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> ambitiously derived their descent from the heroes who had repulsed the arms of <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> and subdued the nations of the earth.
 The temporal honours which the devout <PERSON>Paula</PERSON> (11) inherited and despised are carefully recapitulated by Jerom, the guide of her conscience and the historian of her life.
 The genealogy of her father, Rogatus, which ascended as high as Agamemnon, might seem to betray a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> origin; but her mother, Blasilla, numbered the Scipios, Amilius Paulus, and the <PERSON>Gracchi</PERSON> in the list of her ancestors; and Toxotius, the husband of Paula, deduced his royal lineage from Aeneas, the father of the <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> line.
 The vanity of the rich, who desired to be noble, was gratified by these lofty pretensions.
 Encouraged by the applause of their parasites, they easily imposed on the credulity of the vulgar; and were countenanced in some measure by the custom of adopting the name of their patron, which had always prevailed among the freedmen and clients of illustrious families.
 Most of those families, however, attacked by so many causes of external violence or internal decay, were gradually extirpated: and it would be more reasonable to seek for a lineal descent of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> generations among the mountains of the <LOC>Alps</LOC> or in the peaceful solitude of Apulia, than on the theatre of Rome, the seat of fortune, of danger, and of perpetual revolutions.
 Under each successive reign and from every province of the empire a crowd of hardy adventurers, rising to eminence by their talents or their vices, usurped the wealth, the honours, and the palaces of Rome; and oppressed or protected the poor and humble remains of consular families, who were ignorant, perhaps, of the glory of their ancestors.
(12) The <NORP>Anician</NORP> family In the time of <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> the senators unanimously yielded the pre-eminence to the <NORP>Anician</NORP> line; and a slight view of their history will serve to appreciate the rank and antiquity of the noble families which contended only for the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> place.
(13) During the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ages of the city the name of the <PERSON>Anicians</PERSON> was unknown; they appear to have derived their origin from Praeneste; and the ambition of those new citizens was long satisfied with the plebeian honours of tribunes of the people.
(14) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-eight years before the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era the family was ennobled by the praetorship of Anicius, who gloriously terminated the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> war by the conquest of the nation and the captivity of their king.
 (15) From the triumph of that general <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> consulships in distant periods mark the succession of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> name.
(16) From the reign of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> to the final extinction of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire that name shone with a lustre which was not eclipsed in the public estimation by the majesty of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple.
(17) The several branches to whom it was communicated united, by marriage or inheritance, the wealth and titles of the Annian, the Petronian, and the <NORP>Olybrian</NORP> houses; and in each generation the number of consulships was multiplied by an hereditary claim.
(18) The <NORP>Anician</NORP> family excelled in faith and in riches: they were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate who embraced <NORP>Christianity</NORP> and it is probable that <PERSON>Anicius</PERSON> Julian, who was afterwards consul and praefect of the city, atoned for his attachment to the party of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> by the readiness with which he accepted the religion of Constantine.
 (19) Their ample patrimony was increased by the industry of Probus, the chief of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, who shared with <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> the honours of the consulship, and exercised <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> times the high office of <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect.
 (20) His immense estates were scattered over the wide extent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; and though the public might suspect or disapprove the methods by which they had been acquired, the generosity and magnificence of that fortunate statesman deserved the gratitude of his clients and the admiration of strangers.
(21) Such was the respect entertained for his memory, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons of Probus, in their earliest youth and at the request of the senate, were associated in the consular dignity: a memorable distinction, without example in the annals of Rome.
(22) Wealth of <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles.
 "The marbles of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> palace," were used as a proverbial expression of opulence and splendour;(23) but the nobles and senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> aspired in due gradation to imitate that illustrious family.
 The accurate description of the city, which was composed in the <GPE>Theodosian</GPE> age, enumerates <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty houses, the residence of wealthy and honourable citizens.
 (24) Many of these stately mansions might almost excuse the exaggeration of the poet—that <GPE>Rome</GPE> contained a multitude of palaces, and that each palace was equal to a city, since it included within its own precincts everything which could be subservient either to use or luxury: markets, hippodromes, temples, fountains, baths, porticos, shady groves, and artificial aviaries.
(25) The historian Olympiodorus, who represents the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> when it was besieged by the Goths,(26) continues to observe that several of the richest senators received from their estates an annual income of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling; without computing the stated provision of corn and wine, which, had they been sold, might have equalled in value <CARDINAL>one-third</CARDINAL> of the money.
 Compared to this immoderate wealth, an ordinary revenue of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds of gold might be considered as no more than adequate to the dignity of the <NORP>senatorian</NORP> rank, which required many expenses of a public and ostentatious kind.
 Several examples are recorded in the age of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> of vain and popular nobles who celebrated the year of their praetorship by a festival which lasted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days and cost above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling.
(27) The estates of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, which so far exceed the proportion of modern wealth, were not confined to the limits of Italy.
 Their possessions extended far beyond the <NORP>Ionian</NORP> and <NORP>Agean</NORP> seas to the most distant provinces: the city of Nicopolis, which <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> had founded as an eternal monument of the <NORP>Actian</NORP> victory, was the property of the devout Paula;(28) and it is observed by Seneca, that the rivers which had divided hostile nations now flowed through the lands of private citizens.
(29) According to their temper and circumstances, the estates of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were either cultivated by the labour of their slaves, or granted, for a certain and stipulated rent, to the industrious farmer.
 The economical writers of antiquity strenuously recommend the former method wherever it may be practicable but if the object should be removed by its distance or magnitude from the immediate eye of the master, they prefer the active care of an old hereditary tenant, attached to the soil and interested in the produce, to the mercenary administration of a negligent, perhaps an unfaithful steward.
(30) Their manners The opulent nobles of an immense capital, who were never excited by the pursuit of military glory, and seldom engaged in the occupations of civil government, naturally resigned their leisure to the business and amusements of private life.
 At <GPE>Rome</GPE> commerce was always held in contempt; but the senators, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age of the republic, increased their patrimony and multiplied their clients by the lucrative practice of usury, and the obsolete laws were eluded or violated by the mutual inclinations and interest of both parties.
 (31) A considerable mass of treasure must always have existed at Rome, either in the current coin of the empire, or in the form of gold and silver plate; and there were many sideboards in the time of Pliny which contained more solid silver than had been transported by <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> from vanquished Carthage.
(32) The greater part of the nobles, who dissipated their fortunes in profuse luxury, found themselves poor in the midst of wealth, and idle in a constant round of dissipation.
 Their desires were continually gratified by the labour of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> hands; of the numerous train of their domestic slaves, who were actuated by the fear of punishment; and of the various professions of artificers and merchants, who were more powerfully impelled by the hopes of gain.
 The ancients were destitute of many of the conveniences of life which have been invented or improved by the progress of industry; and the plenty of glass and linen has diffused more real comforts among the modern nations of <LOC>Europe</LOC> than the senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> could derive from all the refinements of pompous or sensual luxury.
(33) Their luxury and their manners have been the subject of minute and laborious disquisition; but as such inquiries would divert me too long from the design of the present work, I shall produce an authentic state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and its inhabitants which is more peculiarly applicable to the period of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion.
 <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus, who prudently chose the capital of the empire as the residence the best adapted to the historian of his own times, has mixed with the narrative of public events a lively representation of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant.
 The judicious reader will not always approve the asperity of censure, the choice of circumstances, or the style of expression; he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices and personal resentments which soured the temper of <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> himself; but he will surely observe, with philosophic curiosity, the interesting and original picture of the manners of Rome.
(34) Character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles, by <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus "The greatness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> (such is the language of the historian) was founded on the rare and almost incredible alliance of virtue and of fortune.
 The long period of her infancy was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of Italy, the neighbours and enemies of the rising city.
 In the strength and ardour of youth she sustained the storms of war, carried her victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains, and brought home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe.
 At length, verging towards old age, and sometimes conquering by the terror only of her name, she sought the blessings of ease and tranquillity.
 The VENERABLE CITY, which had trampled on the necks of the fiercest nations, and established a system of laws, the perpetual guardians of justice and freedom, was content, like a wise and wealthy parent, to devolve on the Caesars, her favourite sons, the care of governing her ample patrimony.
 (35) A secure and profound peace, such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of Numa, succeeded to the tumults of a republic; while <GPE>Rome</GPE> was still adored as the queen of the earth, and the subject nations still reverenced the name of the people and the majesty of the senate.
 But this native splendour (continues Ammianus) is degraded and sullied by the conduct of some nobles, who, unmindful of their own dignity and of that of their country, assume an unbounded licence of vice and folly.
 They contend with each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames, and curiously select or invent the most lofty and sonorous appellations — <PERSON>Reburrus</PERSON> or Fabunius, <PERSON>Pagonius</PERSON> or <PERSON>Tarrasius</PERSON> (36) which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and respect.
 From a vain ambition of perpetuating their memory, they affect to multiply their likeness in statues of bronze and marble; nor are they satisfied unless those statues are covered with plates of gold; an honourable distinction, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> granted to <PERSON>Acilius</PERSON> the consul, after he had subdued by his arms and counsels the power of king Antiochus.
 The ostentation of displaying, of magnifying perhaps, the rent roll of the estates which they possess in all the provinces, from the rising to the setting sun, provokes the just resentment of every man who recollects that their poor and invincible ancestors were not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers by the delicacy of their food or the splendour of their apparel.
 But the modern nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the loftiness of their chariots,(37) and the weighty magnificence of their dress.
 Their long robes of silk and purple float in the wind; and as they are agitated, by art or accident, they occasionally discover the under garments, the rich tunics, embroidered with the figures of various animals.
 (38) Followed by a train of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> servants, and tearing up the pavement, they move along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they travelled with post-horses and the example of the senators is boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies, whose covered carriages are continually driving round the immense space of the city and suburbs.
 Whenever these persons of high distinction condescend to visit the public baths, they assume, on their entrance, a tone of loud and insolent command, and appropriate to their own use the conveniences which were designed for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 If, in these places of mixed and general resort, they meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures, they express their affection by a tender embrace, while they proudly decline the salutations of their fellow-citizens, who are not permitted to aspire above the honour of kissing their hands or their knees.
 As soon as they have indulged themselves in the refreshment of the bath, they resume their rings and the other ensigns of their dignity, select from their private wardrobe of the finest linen, such as might suffice for a dozen persons, the garments the most agreeable to their fancy, and maintain till their departure the same haughty demeanour, which perhaps might have been excused in the great <PERSON>Marcellus</PERSON> after the conquest of Syracuse.
 Sometimes indeed these heroes undertake more arduous achievements: they visit their estates in Italy, and procure themselves, by the toil of servile hands, the amusements of the chase.
 (39) If at any time, but more especially on a hot day, they have courage to sail in their painted galleys from the Lucrine lake (40) to their elegant villas on the seacoast of <LOC>Puteoli</LOC> and Caieta, (41) they compare their own expeditions to the marches of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Alexander.
 Yet should a fly presume to settle on the silken folds of their gilded umbrellas, should a sunbeam penetrate through some unguarded and imperceptible chink, they deplore their intolerable hardships, and lament in affected language that they were not born in the land of the Cimmerians, (42) the regions of eternal darkness.
 In these journeys into the country (43) the whole body of the household marches with their master.
 In the same manner as the cavalry and infantry, the heavy and the light armed troops, the advanced guard and the rear, are marshalled by the skill of their military leaders, so the domestic officers, who bear a rod as an ensign of authority, distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves and attendants.
 The baggage and wardrobe move in the front, and are immediately followed by a multitude of cooks and inferior ministers employed in the service of the kitchens and of the table.
 The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of slaves, increased by the accidental concourse of idle or dependent plebeians.
 The rear is closed by the favourite band of eunuchs, distributed from age to youth, according to the order of seniority.
 Their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of the indignant spectators, who are ready to execrate the memory of <NORP>Semiramis</NORP> for the cruel art which she invented of frustrating the purposes of nature, and of blasting in the bud the hopes of future generations.
 In the exercise of domestic jurisdiction the nobles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> express an exquisite sensibility for any personal injury, and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human species.
 When they have called for warm water, if a slave has been tardy in his obedience, he is instantly chastised with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> lashes; but should the same slave commit a wilful murder, the master will mildly observe that he is a worthless fellow, but that if he repeats the offence he shall not escape punishment.
 Hospitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans; and every stranger who could plead either merit or misfortune was relieved or rewarded by their generosity.
 At present, if a foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the proud and wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> audience with such warm professions and such kind inquiries, that he retires enchanted with the affability of his illustrious friend, and full of regret that he had so long delayed his journey to Rome, the native seat of manners as well as of empire.
 Secure of a favourable reception, he repeats his visit the ensuing day, and is mortified by the discovery that his person, his name, and his country are already forgotten.
 If he still has resolution to persevere, he is gradually numbered in the train of dependents, and obtains the permission to pay his assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty patron, incapable of gratitude or friendship, who scarcely deigns remark his presence, his departure, or his return.
 Whenever the rich prepare a solemn and popular entertainment, (44) whenever they celebrate with profuse and pernicious luxury their private banquets, the choice of the guests is the subject of anxious deliberation.
 The modest, the sober, and the learned are seldom preferred and the nomenclators, who are commonly swayed by interested motives, have the address to insert in the list of invitations the obscure names of the most worthless of mankind.
 But the frequent and familiar companions of the great are those parasites who practise the most useful of all arts, the art of flattery; who eagerly applaud each word and every action of their immortal patron; gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated pavements, and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit.
 At the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tables the birds, the squirrels, (45) or the fish, which appear of an uncommon size are contemplated with curious attention; a pair of scales is accurately applied to ascertain their real weight and, while the more rational guests are disgusted by the vain and tedious repetition, notaries are summoned to attest by an authentic record the truth of such a marvellous event.
 Another method of introduction into the houses and society of the great is derived from the profession of gaming, or, as it is more politely styled, of play.
 The confederates are united by a strict and indissoluble bond of friendship, or rather of conspiracy; a superior degree of skill in the <NORP>Tesserarian</NORP> art (which may be interpreted the game of dice and tables (46)) is a sure road to wealth and reputation.
 A master of that sublime science, who in a supper or assembly is placed below a magistrate, displays in his countenance the surprise and indignation which <PERSON>Cato</PERSON> might be supposed to feel when he was refused the praetorship by the votes of a capricious people.
 The acquisition of knowledge seldom engages the curiosity of the nobles, who abhor the fatigue and disdain the advantages of study; and the only books which they peruse are the Satires of Juvenal, and the verbose and fabulous histories of Marius Maximus.
 (47) The libraries which they have inherited from their fathers are secluded, like dreary sepulchres, from the light of day.
 (48) But the costly instruments of the theatre, flutes, and enormous lyres, and hydraulic organs, are constructed for their use; and the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly repeated in the palaces of Rome.
 In those palaces sound is preferred to sense, and the care of the body to that of the mind.
 It is allowed as a salutary maxim, that the light and frivolous suspicion of a contagious malady is of sufficient weight to excuse the visits of the most intimate friends; and even the servants who are despatched to make the decent inquiries are not suffered to return home till they have undergone the ceremony of a previous ablution.
 Yet this selfish and unmanly delicacy occasionally yields to the more imperious passion of avarice.
 The prospect of gain will urge a rich and gouty senator as far as Spoleto; every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is subdued by the hopes of an inheritance, or even of a legacy; and a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the Romans.
 The art of obtaining the signature of a favourable testament, and sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution, is perfectly understood; and it has happened that in the same house, though in different apartments, a husband and a wife, with the laudable design of over-reaching each other, have summoned their respective lawyers, to declare at the same time their mutual but contradictory intentions.
 The distress which follows and chastises extravagant luxury often reduces the great to the use of the most humiliating expedients.
 When they desire to borrow, they employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the comedy; but when they are called upon to pay, they assume the royal and tragic declamation of the grandsons of Hercules.
 If the demand is repeated, they readily procure some trusty sycophant, instructed to maintain a charge of poison, or magic, against the insolent creditor, who is seldom released from prison till he has signed a discharge of the whole debt.
 These vices, which degrade the moral character of the Romans, are mixed with a puerile superstition that disgraces their understanding.
 They listen with confidence to the predictions of haruspices, who pretend to read in the entrails of victims the signs of future greatness and prosperity; and there are many who do not presume either to bathe or to dine, or to appear in public, till they have diligently consulted, according to the rules of astrology, the situation of <LOC>Mercury</LOC> and the aspect of the moon.
 (49) It is singular enough that this vain credulity may often be discovered among the profane sceptics who impiously doubt or deny the existence of a celestial power.
" State and character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people In populous cities, which are the seat of commerce and manufactures, the middle ranks of inhabitants, who derive their subsistence from the dexterity or labour of their hands, are commonly the most prolific, the most useful, and; in that sense, the most respectable part of the community.
 But the plebeians of Rome, who disdained such sedentary and servile arts, had been oppressed from the earliest times by the weight of debt and usury, and the husbandman, during the term of his military service, was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm.
 (50) The lands of Italy, which had been originally divided among the families of free and indigent proprietors, were insensibly purchased or usurped by the avarice of the nobles; and in the age which preceded the fall of the republic, it was computed that only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> citizens were possessed of any independent substance.
(51) Yet as long as the people bestowed by their suffrages the honours of the state, the command of the legions, and the administration of wealthy provinces, their conscious pride alleviated in some measure the hardships of poverty and their wants were seasonably supplied by the ambitious liberality of the candidates, who aspired to secure a venal majority in the <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> tribes, or the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and ninety-three centuries, of Rome.
 But when the prodigal commons had imprudently alienated not only the use, but the inheritance, of power, they sunk, under the reign of the Caesars, into a vile and wretched populace, which must, in a few generations, have been totally extinguished, if it had not been continually recruited by the manumission of slaves and the influx of strangers.
 As early as the time of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> it was the just complaint of the ingenuous natives that the capital had attracted the vices of the universe and the manners of the most opposite nations.
 The intemperance of the Gauls, the cunning and levity of the Greeks, the savage obstinacy of the <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> and Jews, the servile temper of the Asiatics, and the dissolute, effeminate prostitution of the Syrians, were mingled in the various multitude, which, under the proud and false denomination of Romans, presumed to despise their fellow-subjects, and even their sovereigns, who dwelt beyond the precincts of the ETERNAL CITY.
(52) Public distribution of bread, bacon, oil, wine, etc Yet the name of that city was still pronounced with respect: the frequent and capricious tumults of its inhabitants were indulged with impunity; and the successors of Constantine, instead of crushing the last remains of the democracy by the strong arm of military power, embraced the mild policy of Augustus, and studied to relieve the poverty and to amuse the idleness of an innumerable people.
 (53)I.
 For the convenience of the lazy plebeians, the monthly distributions of corn were converted into a <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of bread; a great number of ovens were constructed and maintained at the public expense; and at the appointed hour, each citizen, who was furnished with a ticket, ascended the flight of steps which had been assigned to his peculiar <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> or division, and received, either as a gift or at a very low price, a loaf of bread of the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds for the use of his family.
 II.
The forests of Lucania, whose acorns fattened large droves of wild hogs, (54) afforded, as a species of tribute, a plentiful supply of cheap and wholesome meat.
 During <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months of the year a regular allowance of bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens; and the annual consumption of the capital, at a time when it was much declined from its former lustre, was ascertained, by an edict of Valentinian the Third, at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds.
 (55) III.
In the manners of antiquity the use of oil was indispensable for the lamp as well as for the bath, and the annual tax which was imposed on <LOC>Africa</LOC> for the benefit of <GPE>Rome</GPE> amounted to the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions of pounds, to the measure, perhaps, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> English gallons.
 IV.
 The anxiety of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to provide the metropolis with sufficient plenty of corn was not extended beyond that necessary article of human subsistence; and when the popular clamour accused the dearness and scarcity of wine, a proclamation was issued by the grave reformer to remind his subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst, since the aqueducts of <PERSON>Agrippa</PERSON> had introduced into the city so many copious streams of pure and salubrious water.
(56) This rigid sobriety was insensibly relaxed; and, although the generous design of Aurelian(57) does not appear to have been executed in its full extent, the use of wine was allowed on very easy and liberal terms.
 The administration of the public cellars was delegated to a magistrate of honourable rank; and a considerable part of the vintage of <GPE>Campania</GPE> was reserved for the fortunate inhabitants of Rome.
 Use of the public baths.
 The stupendous aqueducts, so justly celebrated by the praises of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> himself, replenished the Thermae, or baths, which had been constructed in every part of the city with <NORP>Imperial</NORP> magnificence.
 The baths of Antoninus Caracalla, which were open, at stated hours, for the indiscriminate service of the senators and the people, contained above sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> seats of marble; and more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> were reckoned in the baths of Diocletian.
 (58) The walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious mosaics, that imitated the art of the pencil in the elegance of design and the variety of colours.
 The <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> granite was beautifully encrusted with the precious green marble of Numidia; the perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the capacious basins through so many wide mouths of bright and massy silver; and the meanest <NORP>Roman</NORP> could purchase, with a small copper coin, the <DATE>daily</DATE> enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury which might excite the envy of the kings of Asia.
(59) From these stately palaces issued a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians, without shoes and without a mantle; who loitered away whole days in the street or <ORG>Forum</ORG> to hear news and to hold disputes who dissipated in extravagant gaming the miserable pittance of their wives and children; and spent the <TIME>hours</TIME> of the night in obscure taverns and brothels in the indulgence of gross and vulgar sensuality.
(60) Games and spectacles But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles.
 The piety of <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people still considered the <FAC>Circus</FAC> as their home, their temple, and the seat of the republic.
 The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secure their places, and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos.
 From the morning to the evening, careless of the sun or of the rain, the spectators, who sometimes amounted to the number of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand, remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the colours which they espoused; and the happiness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> appeared to hang on the event of a race.
 (61) The same immoderate ardour inspired their clamours and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation.
 These representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste, and perhaps of virtue.
 But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans, who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius,(62) had been almost totally silent since the fall of the republic; (63) and their place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and splendid pageantry.
 The pantomimes, (64) who maintained their reputation from the age of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century, expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people.
 The vast and magnificent theatres of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were filled by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> female dancers, and by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> singers, with the masters of the respective choruses.
 Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed, that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts.
(65) Populous of <GPE>Rome</GPE> It is said that the foolish curiosity of <GPE>Elagabalus</GPE> attempted to discover, from the quantity of spiders' webs, the number of the inhabitants of Rome.
 A more rational method of inquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who could easily have resolved a question so important for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government and so interesting to succeeding ages.
 The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the common average, we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which should destroy the extravagant assertions of critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers.
(66) The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances, which, slight and imperfect as they are, may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome.
 I.
 When the capital of the empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal to twenty-one miles.
(67) It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle, the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference.
 II.
 The architect Vitruvius, who flourished in the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, observes that the innumerable habitations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air.
 (68) But the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the walls of <GPE>Rome</GPE> should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground.
(69) III.
 <PERSON>Juvenal</PERSON> (70) laments, as it should seem from his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay, from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase in the little towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> a cheerful, commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
 House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces and gardens; but the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was crowded into a narrow space; and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided, as it is still the custom of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and other cities, among several families of plebeians.
 IV.
 The total number of houses in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of <GPE>Rome</GPE> composed under the reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-two.
(71) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes of domus and of insulae, into which they are divided, include all the habitations of the capital, of every rank and condition, from the marble palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodginghouse where the poet <PERSON>Codrus</PERSON> and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the tiles.
 If we adopt the same average which, under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris,(72) and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand: a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe.
(73) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> seige of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408.
 Such was the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> under the reign of Honorius, at the time when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
 (74) By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an assault, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> encompassed the walls, commanded the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tiber, from which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world; but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim.
 Perhaps in the person of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor; they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 Actuated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city.
 That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine.
 Famine.
 The <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion.
 The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband.
(75) But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves.
 The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain.
 The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger.
 A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers (such was the horrid conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast), even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants!(76)Plague.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy, the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease.
 The assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported, for some time, the fainting resolution of the Romans, Superstition.
 till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a preternatural deliverance.
 Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or fanaticism of some <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> diviners, that, by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians.
(77) The important secret was communicated to Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St.
 Peter is accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates; the majority of that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> displeasure, refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism.
(78) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, "If such, O king! are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?" "YOUR LIVES," replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Genealogy of the senators From the time of the Punic war the uninterrupted succession of senators had preserved the name and image of the republic; and the degenerate subjects of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> ambitiously derived their descent from the heroes who had repulsed the arms of <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> and subdued the nations of the earth.
 The temporal honours which the devout <PERSON>Paula</PERSON> (11) inherited and despised are carefully recapitulated by Jerom, the guide of her conscience and the historian of her life.
 The genealogy of her father, Rogatus, which ascended as high as Agamemnon, might seem to betray a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> origin; but her mother, Blasilla, numbered the Scipios, Amilius Paulus, and the <PERSON>Gracchi</PERSON> in the list of her ancestors; and Toxotius, the husband of Paula, deduced his royal lineage from Aeneas, the father of the <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> line.
 The vanity of the rich, who desired to be noble, was gratified by these lofty pretensions.
 Encouraged by the applause of their parasites, they easily imposed on the credulity of the vulgar; and were countenanced in some measure by the custom of adopting the name of their patron, which had always prevailed among the freedmen and clients of illustrious families.
 Most of those families, however, attacked by so many causes of external violence or internal decay, were gradually extirpated: and it would be more reasonable to seek for a lineal descent of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> generations among the mountains of the <LOC>Alps</LOC> or in the peaceful solitude of Apulia, than on the theatre of Rome, the seat of fortune, of danger, and of perpetual revolutions.
 Under each successive reign and from every province of the empire a crowd of hardy adventurers, rising to eminence by their talents or their vices, usurped the wealth, the honours, and the palaces of Rome; and oppressed or protected the poor and humble remains of consular families, who were ignorant, perhaps, of the glory of their ancestors.
(12) The <NORP>Anician</NORP> family In the time of <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> the senators unanimously yielded the pre-eminence to the <NORP>Anician</NORP> line; and a slight view of their history will serve to appreciate the rank and antiquity of the noble families which contended only for the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> place.
(13) During the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ages of the city the name of the <PERSON>Anicians</PERSON> was unknown; they appear to have derived their origin from Praeneste; and the ambition of those new citizens was long satisfied with the plebeian honours of tribunes of the people.
(14) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-eight years before the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era the family was ennobled by the praetorship of Anicius, who gloriously terminated the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> war by the conquest of the nation and the captivity of their king.
 (15) From the triumph of that general <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> consulships in distant periods mark the succession of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> name.
(16) From the reign of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> to the final extinction of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire that name shone with a lustre which was not eclipsed in the public estimation by the majesty of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple.
(17) The several branches to whom it was communicated united, by marriage or inheritance, the wealth and titles of the Annian, the Petronian, and the <NORP>Olybrian</NORP> houses; and in each generation the number of consulships was multiplied by an hereditary claim.
(18) The <NORP>Anician</NORP> family excelled in faith and in riches: they were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate who embraced <NORP>Christianity</NORP> and it is probable that <PERSON>Anicius</PERSON> Julian, who was afterwards consul and praefect of the city, atoned for his attachment to the party of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> by the readiness with which he accepted the religion of Constantine.
 (19) Their ample patrimony was increased by the industry of Probus, the chief of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, who shared with <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> the honours of the consulship, and exercised <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> times the high office of <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect.
 (20) His immense estates were scattered over the wide extent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; and though the public might suspect or disapprove the methods by which they had been acquired, the generosity and magnificence of that fortunate statesman deserved the gratitude of his clients and the admiration of strangers.
(21) Such was the respect entertained for his memory, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons of Probus, in their earliest youth and at the request of the senate, were associated in the consular dignity: a memorable distinction, without example in the annals of Rome.
(22) Wealth of <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles.
 "The marbles of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> palace," were used as a proverbial expression of opulence and splendour;(23) but the nobles and senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> aspired in due gradation to imitate that illustrious family.
 The accurate description of the city, which was composed in the <GPE>Theodosian</GPE> age, enumerates <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty houses, the residence of wealthy and honourable citizens.
 (24) Many of these stately mansions might almost excuse the exaggeration of the poet—that <GPE>Rome</GPE> contained a multitude of palaces, and that each palace was equal to a city, since it included within its own precincts everything which could be subservient either to use or luxury: markets, hippodromes, temples, fountains, baths, porticos, shady groves, and artificial aviaries.
(25) The historian Olympiodorus, who represents the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> when it was besieged by the Goths,(26) continues to observe that several of the richest senators received from their estates an annual income of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling; without computing the stated provision of corn and wine, which, had they been sold, might have equalled in value <CARDINAL>one-third</CARDINAL> of the money.
 Compared to this immoderate wealth, an ordinary revenue of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds of gold might be considered as no more than adequate to the dignity of the <NORP>senatorian</NORP> rank, which required many expenses of a public and ostentatious kind.
 Several examples are recorded in the age of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> of vain and popular nobles who celebrated the year of their praetorship by a festival which lasted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days and cost above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling.
(27) The estates of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, which so far exceed the proportion of modern wealth, were not confined to the limits of Italy.
 Their possessions extended far beyond the <NORP>Ionian</NORP> and <NORP>Agean</NORP> seas to the most distant provinces: the city of Nicopolis, which <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> had founded as an eternal monument of the <NORP>Actian</NORP> victory, was the property of the devout Paula;(28) and it is observed by Seneca, that the rivers which had divided hostile nations now flowed through the lands of private citizens.
(29) According to their temper and circumstances, the estates of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were either cultivated by the labour of their slaves, or granted, for a certain and stipulated rent, to the industrious farmer.
 The economical writers of antiquity strenuously recommend the former method wherever it may be practicable but if the object should be removed by its distance or magnitude from the immediate eye of the master, they prefer the active care of an old hereditary tenant, attached to the soil and interested in the produce, to the mercenary administration of a negligent, perhaps an unfaithful steward.
(30) Their manners The opulent nobles of an immense capital, who were never excited by the pursuit of military glory, and seldom engaged in the occupations of civil government, naturally resigned their leisure to the business and amusements of private life.
 At <GPE>Rome</GPE> commerce was always held in contempt; but the senators, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age of the republic, increased their patrimony and multiplied their clients by the lucrative practice of usury, and the obsolete laws were eluded or violated by the mutual inclinations and interest of both parties.
 (31) A considerable mass of treasure must always have existed at Rome, either in the current coin of the empire, or in the form of gold and silver plate; and there were many sideboards in the time of Pliny which contained more solid silver than had been transported by <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> from vanquished Carthage.
(32) The greater part of the nobles, who dissipated their fortunes in profuse luxury, found themselves poor in the midst of wealth, and idle in a constant round of dissipation.
 Their desires were continually gratified by the labour of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> hands; of the numerous train of their domestic slaves, who were actuated by the fear of punishment; and of the various professions of artificers and merchants, who were more powerfully impelled by the hopes of gain.
 The ancients were destitute of many of the conveniences of life which have been invented or improved by the progress of industry; and the plenty of glass and linen has diffused more real comforts among the modern nations of <LOC>Europe</LOC> than the senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> could derive from all the refinements of pompous or sensual luxury.
(33) Their luxury and their manners have been the subject of minute and laborious disquisition; but as such inquiries would divert me too long from the design of the present work, I shall produce an authentic state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and its inhabitants which is more peculiarly applicable to the period of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion.
 <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus, who prudently chose the capital of the empire as the residence the best adapted to the historian of his own times, has mixed with the narrative of public events a lively representation of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant.
 The judicious reader will not always approve the asperity of censure, the choice of circumstances, or the style of expression; he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices and personal resentments which soured the temper of <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> himself; but he will surely observe, with philosophic curiosity, the interesting and original picture of the manners of Rome.
(34) Character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles, by <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus "The greatness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> (such is the language of the historian) was founded on the rare and almost incredible alliance of virtue and of fortune.
 The long period of her infancy was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of Italy, the neighbours and enemies of the rising city.
 In the strength and ardour of youth she sustained the storms of war, carried her victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains, and brought home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe.
 At length, verging towards old age, and sometimes conquering by the terror only of her name, she sought the blessings of ease and tranquillity.
 The VENERABLE CITY, which had trampled on the necks of the fiercest nations, and established a system of laws, the perpetual guardians of justice and freedom, was content, like a wise and wealthy parent, to devolve on the Caesars, her favourite sons, the care of governing her ample patrimony.
 (35) A secure and profound peace, such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of Numa, succeeded to the tumults of a republic; while <GPE>Rome</GPE> was still adored as the queen of the earth, and the subject nations still reverenced the name of the people and the majesty of the senate.
 But this native splendour (continues Ammianus) is degraded and sullied by the conduct of some nobles, who, unmindful of their own dignity and of that of their country, assume an unbounded licence of vice and folly.
 They contend with each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames, and curiously select or invent the most lofty and sonorous appellations — <PERSON>Reburrus</PERSON> or Fabunius, <PERSON>Pagonius</PERSON> or <PERSON>Tarrasius</PERSON> (36) which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and respect.
 From a vain ambition of perpetuating their memory, they affect to multiply their likeness in statues of bronze and marble; nor are they satisfied unless those statues are covered with plates of gold; an honourable distinction, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> granted to <PERSON>Acilius</PERSON> the consul, after he had subdued by his arms and counsels the power of king Antiochus.
 The ostentation of displaying, of magnifying perhaps, the rent roll of the estates which they possess in all the provinces, from the rising to the setting sun, provokes the just resentment of every man who recollects that their poor and invincible ancestors were not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers by the delicacy of their food or the splendour of their apparel.
 But the modern nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the loftiness of their chariots,(37) and the weighty magnificence of their dress.
 Their long robes of silk and purple float in the wind; and as they are agitated, by art or accident, they occasionally discover the under garments, the rich tunics, embroidered with the figures of various animals.
 (38) Followed by a train of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> servants, and tearing up the pavement, they move along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they travelled with post-horses and the example of the senators is boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies, whose covered carriages are continually driving round the immense space of the city and suburbs.
 Whenever these persons of high distinction condescend to visit the public baths, they assume, on their entrance, a tone of loud and insolent command, and appropriate to their own use the conveniences which were designed for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 If, in these places of mixed and general resort, they meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures, they express their affection by a tender embrace, while they proudly decline the salutations of their fellow-citizens, who are not permitted to aspire above the honour of kissing their hands or their knees.
 As soon as they have indulged themselves in the refreshment of the bath, they resume their rings and the other ensigns of their dignity, select from their private wardrobe of the finest linen, such as might suffice for a dozen persons, the garments the most agreeable to their fancy, and maintain till their departure the same haughty demeanour, which perhaps might have been excused in the great <PERSON>Marcellus</PERSON> after the conquest of Syracuse.
 Sometimes indeed these heroes undertake more arduous achievements: they visit their estates in Italy, and procure themselves, by the toil of servile hands, the amusements of the chase.
 (39) If at any time, but more especially on a hot day, they have courage to sail in their painted galleys from the Lucrine lake (40) to their elegant villas on the seacoast of <LOC>Puteoli</LOC> and Caieta, (41) they compare their own expeditions to the marches of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Alexander.
 Yet should a fly presume to settle on the silken folds of their gilded umbrellas, should a sunbeam penetrate through some unguarded and imperceptible chink, they deplore their intolerable hardships, and lament in affected language that they were not born in the land of the Cimmerians, (42) the regions of eternal darkness.
 In these journeys into the country (43) the whole body of the household marches with their master.
 In the same manner as the cavalry and infantry, the heavy and the light armed troops, the advanced guard and the rear, are marshalled by the skill of their military leaders, so the domestic officers, who bear a rod as an ensign of authority, distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves and attendants.
 The baggage and wardrobe move in the front, and are immediately followed by a multitude of cooks and inferior ministers employed in the service of the kitchens and of the table.
 The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of slaves, increased by the accidental concourse of idle or dependent plebeians.
 The rear is closed by the favourite band of eunuchs, distributed from age to youth, according to the order of seniority.
 Their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of the indignant spectators, who are ready to execrate the memory of <NORP>Semiramis</NORP> for the cruel art which she invented of frustrating the purposes of nature, and of blasting in the bud the hopes of future generations.
 In the exercise of domestic jurisdiction the nobles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> express an exquisite sensibility for any personal injury, and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human species.
 When they have called for warm water, if a slave has been tardy in his obedience, he is instantly chastised with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> lashes; but should the same slave commit a wilful murder, the master will mildly observe that he is a worthless fellow, but that if he repeats the offence he shall not escape punishment.
 Hospitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans; and every stranger who could plead either merit or misfortune was relieved or rewarded by their generosity.
 At present, if a foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the proud and wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> audience with such warm professions and such kind inquiries, that he retires enchanted with the affability of his illustrious friend, and full of regret that he had so long delayed his journey to Rome, the native seat of manners as well as of empire.
 Secure of a favourable reception, he repeats his visit the ensuing day, and is mortified by the discovery that his person, his name, and his country are already forgotten.
 If he still has resolution to persevere, he is gradually numbered in the train of dependents, and obtains the permission to pay his assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty patron, incapable of gratitude or friendship, who scarcely deigns remark his presence, his departure, or his return.
 Whenever the rich prepare a solemn and popular entertainment, (44) whenever they celebrate with profuse and pernicious luxury their private banquets, the choice of the guests is the subject of anxious deliberation.
 The modest, the sober, and the learned are seldom preferred and the nomenclators, who are commonly swayed by interested motives, have the address to insert in the list of invitations the obscure names of the most worthless of mankind.
 But the frequent and familiar companions of the great are those parasites who practise the most useful of all arts, the art of flattery; who eagerly applaud each word and every action of their immortal patron; gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated pavements, and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit.
 At the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tables the birds, the squirrels, (45) or the fish, which appear of an uncommon size are contemplated with curious attention; a pair of scales is accurately applied to ascertain their real weight and, while the more rational guests are disgusted by the vain and tedious repetition, notaries are summoned to attest by an authentic record the truth of such a marvellous event.
 Another method of introduction into the houses and society of the great is derived from the profession of gaming, or, as it is more politely styled, of play.
 The confederates are united by a strict and indissoluble bond of friendship, or rather of conspiracy; a superior degree of skill in the <NORP>Tesserarian</NORP> art (which may be interpreted the game of dice and tables (46)) is a sure road to wealth and reputation.
 A master of that sublime science, who in a supper or assembly is placed below a magistrate, displays in his countenance the surprise and indignation which <PERSON>Cato</PERSON> might be supposed to feel when he was refused the praetorship by the votes of a capricious people.
 The acquisition of knowledge seldom engages the curiosity of the nobles, who abhor the fatigue and disdain the advantages of study; and the only books which they peruse are the Satires of Juvenal, and the verbose and fabulous histories of Marius Maximus.
 (47) The libraries which they have inherited from their fathers are secluded, like dreary sepulchres, from the light of day.
 (48) But the costly instruments of the theatre, flutes, and enormous lyres, and hydraulic organs, are constructed for their use; and the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly repeated in the palaces of Rome.
 In those palaces sound is preferred to sense, and the care of the body to that of the mind.
 It is allowed as a salutary maxim, that the light and frivolous suspicion of a contagious malady is of sufficient weight to excuse the visits of the most intimate friends; and even the servants who are despatched to make the decent inquiries are not suffered to return home till they have undergone the ceremony of a previous ablution.
 Yet this selfish and unmanly delicacy occasionally yields to the more imperious passion of avarice.
 The prospect of gain will urge a rich and gouty senator as far as Spoleto; every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is subdued by the hopes of an inheritance, or even of a legacy; and a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the Romans.
 The art of obtaining the signature of a favourable testament, and sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution, is perfectly understood; and it has happened that in the same house, though in different apartments, a husband and a wife, with the laudable design of over-reaching each other, have summoned their respective lawyers, to declare at the same time their mutual but contradictory intentions.
 The distress which follows and chastises extravagant luxury often reduces the great to the use of the most humiliating expedients.
 When they desire to borrow, they employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the comedy; but when they are called upon to pay, they assume the royal and tragic declamation of the grandsons of Hercules.
 If the demand is repeated, they readily procure some trusty sycophant, instructed to maintain a charge of poison, or magic, against the insolent creditor, who is seldom released from prison till he has signed a discharge of the whole debt.
 These vices, which degrade the moral character of the Romans, are mixed with a puerile superstition that disgraces their understanding.
 They listen with confidence to the predictions of haruspices, who pretend to read in the entrails of victims the signs of future greatness and prosperity; and there are many who do not presume either to bathe or to dine, or to appear in public, till they have diligently consulted, according to the rules of astrology, the situation of <LOC>Mercury</LOC> and the aspect of the moon.
 (49) It is singular enough that this vain credulity may often be discovered among the profane sceptics who impiously doubt or deny the existence of a celestial power.
" State and character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people In populous cities, which are the seat of commerce and manufactures, the middle ranks of inhabitants, who derive their subsistence from the dexterity or labour of their hands, are commonly the most prolific, the most useful, and; in that sense, the most respectable part of the community.
 But the plebeians of Rome, who disdained such sedentary and servile arts, had been oppressed from the earliest times by the weight of debt and usury, and the husbandman, during the term of his military service, was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm.
 (50) The lands of Italy, which had been originally divided among the families of free and indigent proprietors, were insensibly purchased or usurped by the avarice of the nobles; and in the age which preceded the fall of the republic, it was computed that only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> citizens were possessed of any independent substance.
(51) Yet as long as the people bestowed by their suffrages the honours of the state, the command of the legions, and the administration of wealthy provinces, their conscious pride alleviated in some measure the hardships of poverty and their wants were seasonably supplied by the ambitious liberality of the candidates, who aspired to secure a venal majority in the <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> tribes, or the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and ninety-three centuries, of Rome.
 But when the prodigal commons had imprudently alienated not only the use, but the inheritance, of power, they sunk, under the reign of the Caesars, into a vile and wretched populace, which must, in a few generations, have been totally extinguished, if it had not been continually recruited by the manumission of slaves and the influx of strangers.
 As early as the time of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> it was the just complaint of the ingenuous natives that the capital had attracted the vices of the universe and the manners of the most opposite nations.
 The intemperance of the Gauls, the cunning and levity of the Greeks, the savage obstinacy of the <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> and Jews, the servile temper of the Asiatics, and the dissolute, effeminate prostitution of the Syrians, were mingled in the various multitude, which, under the proud and false denomination of Romans, presumed to despise their fellow-subjects, and even their sovereigns, who dwelt beyond the precincts of the ETERNAL CITY.
(52) Public distribution of bread, bacon, oil, wine, etc Yet the name of that city was still pronounced with respect: the frequent and capricious tumults of its inhabitants were indulged with impunity; and the successors of Constantine, instead of crushing the last remains of the democracy by the strong arm of military power, embraced the mild policy of Augustus, and studied to relieve the poverty and to amuse the idleness of an innumerable people.
 (53)I.
 For the convenience of the lazy plebeians, the monthly distributions of corn were converted into a <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of bread; a great number of ovens were constructed and maintained at the public expense; and at the appointed hour, each citizen, who was furnished with a ticket, ascended the flight of steps which had been assigned to his peculiar <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> or division, and received, either as a gift or at a very low price, a loaf of bread of the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds for the use of his family.
 II.
The forests of Lucania, whose acorns fattened large droves of wild hogs, (54) afforded, as a species of tribute, a plentiful supply of cheap and wholesome meat.
 During <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months of the year a regular allowance of bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens; and the annual consumption of the capital, at a time when it was much declined from its former lustre, was ascertained, by an edict of Valentinian the Third, at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds.
 (55) III.
In the manners of antiquity the use of oil was indispensable for the lamp as well as for the bath, and the annual tax which was imposed on <LOC>Africa</LOC> for the benefit of <GPE>Rome</GPE> amounted to the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions of pounds, to the measure, perhaps, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> English gallons.
 IV.
 The anxiety of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to provide the metropolis with sufficient plenty of corn was not extended beyond that necessary article of human subsistence; and when the popular clamour accused the dearness and scarcity of wine, a proclamation was issued by the grave reformer to remind his subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst, since the aqueducts of <PERSON>Agrippa</PERSON> had introduced into the city so many copious streams of pure and salubrious water.
(56) This rigid sobriety was insensibly relaxed; and, although the generous design of Aurelian(57) does not appear to have been executed in its full extent, the use of wine was allowed on very easy and liberal terms.
 The administration of the public cellars was delegated to a magistrate of honourable rank; and a considerable part of the vintage of <GPE>Campania</GPE> was reserved for the fortunate inhabitants of Rome.
 Use of the public baths.
 The stupendous aqueducts, so justly celebrated by the praises of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> himself, replenished the Thermae, or baths, which had been constructed in every part of the city with <NORP>Imperial</NORP> magnificence.
 The baths of Antoninus Caracalla, which were open, at stated hours, for the indiscriminate service of the senators and the people, contained above sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> seats of marble; and more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> were reckoned in the baths of Diocletian.
 (58) The walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious mosaics, that imitated the art of the pencil in the elegance of design and the variety of colours.
 The <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> granite was beautifully encrusted with the precious green marble of Numidia; the perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the capacious basins through so many wide mouths of bright and massy silver; and the meanest <NORP>Roman</NORP> could purchase, with a small copper coin, the <DATE>daily</DATE> enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury which might excite the envy of the kings of Asia.
(59) From these stately palaces issued a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians, without shoes and without a mantle; who loitered away whole days in the street or <ORG>Forum</ORG> to hear news and to hold disputes who dissipated in extravagant gaming the miserable pittance of their wives and children; and spent the <TIME>hours</TIME> of the night in obscure taverns and brothels in the indulgence of gross and vulgar sensuality.
(60) Games and spectacles But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles.
 The piety of <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people still considered the <FAC>Circus</FAC> as their home, their temple, and the seat of the republic.
 The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secure their places, and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos.
 From the morning to the evening, careless of the sun or of the rain, the spectators, who sometimes amounted to the number of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand, remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the colours which they espoused; and the happiness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> appeared to hang on the event of a race.
 (61) The same immoderate ardour inspired their clamours and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation.
 These representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste, and perhaps of virtue.
 But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans, who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius,(62) had been almost totally silent since the fall of the republic; (63) and their place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and splendid pageantry.
 The pantomimes, (64) who maintained their reputation from the age of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century, expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people.
 The vast and magnificent theatres of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were filled by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> female dancers, and by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> singers, with the masters of the respective choruses.
 Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed, that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts.
(65) Populous of <GPE>Rome</GPE> It is said that the foolish curiosity of <GPE>Elagabalus</GPE> attempted to discover, from the quantity of spiders' webs, the number of the inhabitants of Rome.
 A more rational method of inquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who could easily have resolved a question so important for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government and so interesting to succeeding ages.
 The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the common average, we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which should destroy the extravagant assertions of critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers.
(66) The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances, which, slight and imperfect as they are, may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome.
 I.
 When the capital of the empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal to twenty-one miles.
(67) It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle, the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference.
 II.
 The architect Vitruvius, who flourished in the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, observes that the innumerable habitations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air.
 (68) But the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the walls of <GPE>Rome</GPE> should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground.
(69) III.
 <PERSON>Juvenal</PERSON> (70) laments, as it should seem from his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay, from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase in the little towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> a cheerful, commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
 House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces and gardens; but the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was crowded into a narrow space; and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided, as it is still the custom of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and other cities, among several families of plebeians.
 IV.
 The total number of houses in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of <GPE>Rome</GPE> composed under the reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-two.
(71) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes of domus and of insulae, into which they are divided, include all the habitations of the capital, of every rank and condition, from the marble palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodginghouse where the poet <PERSON>Codrus</PERSON> and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the tiles.
 If we adopt the same average which, under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris,(72) and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand: a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe.
(73) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> seige of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408.
 Such was the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> under the reign of Honorius, at the time when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
 (74) By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an assault, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> encompassed the walls, commanded the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tiber, from which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world; but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim.
 Perhaps in the person of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor; they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 Actuated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city.
 That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine.
 Famine.
 The <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion.
 The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband.
(75) But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves.
 The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain.
 The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger.
 A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers (such was the horrid conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast), even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants!(76)Plague.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy, the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease.
 The assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported, for some time, the fainting resolution of the Romans, Superstition.
 till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a preternatural deliverance.
 Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or fanaticism of some <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> diviners, that, by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians.
(77) The important secret was communicated to Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St.
 Peter is accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates; the majority of that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> displeasure, refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism.
(78) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, "If such, O king! are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?" "YOUR LIVES," replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » The <NORP>Anician</NORP> family In the time of <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> the senators unanimously yielded the pre-eminence to the <NORP>Anician</NORP> line; and a slight view of their history will serve to appreciate the rank and antiquity of the noble families which contended only for the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> place.
(13) During the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ages of the city the name of the <PERSON>Anicians</PERSON> was unknown; they appear to have derived their origin from Praeneste; and the ambition of those new citizens was long satisfied with the plebeian honours of tribunes of the people.
(14) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-eight years before the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era the family was ennobled by the praetorship of Anicius, who gloriously terminated the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> war by the conquest of the nation and the captivity of their king.
 (15) From the triumph of that general <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> consulships in distant periods mark the succession of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> name.
(16) From the reign of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> to the final extinction of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire that name shone with a lustre which was not eclipsed in the public estimation by the majesty of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple.
(17) The several branches to whom it was communicated united, by marriage or inheritance, the wealth and titles of the Annian, the Petronian, and the <NORP>Olybrian</NORP> houses; and in each generation the number of consulships was multiplied by an hereditary claim.
(18) The <NORP>Anician</NORP> family excelled in faith and in riches: they were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate who embraced <NORP>Christianity</NORP> and it is probable that <PERSON>Anicius</PERSON> Julian, who was afterwards consul and praefect of the city, atoned for his attachment to the party of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> by the readiness with which he accepted the religion of Constantine.
 (19) Their ample patrimony was increased by the industry of Probus, the chief of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, who shared with <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> the honours of the consulship, and exercised <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> times the high office of <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect.
 (20) His immense estates were scattered over the wide extent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; and though the public might suspect or disapprove the methods by which they had been acquired, the generosity and magnificence of that fortunate statesman deserved the gratitude of his clients and the admiration of strangers.
(21) Such was the respect entertained for his memory, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons of Probus, in their earliest youth and at the request of the senate, were associated in the consular dignity: a memorable distinction, without example in the annals of Rome.
(22) Wealth of <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles.
 "The marbles of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> palace," were used as a proverbial expression of opulence and splendour;(23) but the nobles and senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> aspired in due gradation to imitate that illustrious family.
 The accurate description of the city, which was composed in the <GPE>Theodosian</GPE> age, enumerates <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty houses, the residence of wealthy and honourable citizens.
 (24) Many of these stately mansions might almost excuse the exaggeration of the poet—that <GPE>Rome</GPE> contained a multitude of palaces, and that each palace was equal to a city, since it included within its own precincts everything which could be subservient either to use or luxury: markets, hippodromes, temples, fountains, baths, porticos, shady groves, and artificial aviaries.
(25) The historian Olympiodorus, who represents the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> when it was besieged by the Goths,(26) continues to observe that several of the richest senators received from their estates an annual income of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling; without computing the stated provision of corn and wine, which, had they been sold, might have equalled in value <CARDINAL>one-third</CARDINAL> of the money.
 Compared to this immoderate wealth, an ordinary revenue of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds of gold might be considered as no more than adequate to the dignity of the <NORP>senatorian</NORP> rank, which required many expenses of a public and ostentatious kind.
 Several examples are recorded in the age of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> of vain and popular nobles who celebrated the year of their praetorship by a festival which lasted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days and cost above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling.
(27) The estates of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, which so far exceed the proportion of modern wealth, were not confined to the limits of Italy.
 Their possessions extended far beyond the <NORP>Ionian</NORP> and <NORP>Agean</NORP> seas to the most distant provinces: the city of Nicopolis, which <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> had founded as an eternal monument of the <NORP>Actian</NORP> victory, was the property of the devout Paula;(28) and it is observed by Seneca, that the rivers which had divided hostile nations now flowed through the lands of private citizens.
(29) According to their temper and circumstances, the estates of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were either cultivated by the labour of their slaves, or granted, for a certain and stipulated rent, to the industrious farmer.
 The economical writers of antiquity strenuously recommend the former method wherever it may be practicable but if the object should be removed by its distance or magnitude from the immediate eye of the master, they prefer the active care of an old hereditary tenant, attached to the soil and interested in the produce, to the mercenary administration of a negligent, perhaps an unfaithful steward.
(30) Their manners The opulent nobles of an immense capital, who were never excited by the pursuit of military glory, and seldom engaged in the occupations of civil government, naturally resigned their leisure to the business and amusements of private life.
 At <GPE>Rome</GPE> commerce was always held in contempt; but the senators, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age of the republic, increased their patrimony and multiplied their clients by the lucrative practice of usury, and the obsolete laws were eluded or violated by the mutual inclinations and interest of both parties.
 (31) A considerable mass of treasure must always have existed at Rome, either in the current coin of the empire, or in the form of gold and silver plate; and there were many sideboards in the time of Pliny which contained more solid silver than had been transported by <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> from vanquished Carthage.
(32) The greater part of the nobles, who dissipated their fortunes in profuse luxury, found themselves poor in the midst of wealth, and idle in a constant round of dissipation.
 Their desires were continually gratified by the labour of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> hands; of the numerous train of their domestic slaves, who were actuated by the fear of punishment; and of the various professions of artificers and merchants, who were more powerfully impelled by the hopes of gain.
 The ancients were destitute of many of the conveniences of life which have been invented or improved by the progress of industry; and the plenty of glass and linen has diffused more real comforts among the modern nations of <LOC>Europe</LOC> than the senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> could derive from all the refinements of pompous or sensual luxury.
(33) Their luxury and their manners have been the subject of minute and laborious disquisition; but as such inquiries would divert me too long from the design of the present work, I shall produce an authentic state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and its inhabitants which is more peculiarly applicable to the period of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion.
 <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus, who prudently chose the capital of the empire as the residence the best adapted to the historian of his own times, has mixed with the narrative of public events a lively representation of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant.
 The judicious reader will not always approve the asperity of censure, the choice of circumstances, or the style of expression; he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices and personal resentments which soured the temper of <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> himself; but he will surely observe, with philosophic curiosity, the interesting and original picture of the manners of Rome.
(34) Character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles, by <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus "The greatness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> (such is the language of the historian) was founded on the rare and almost incredible alliance of virtue and of fortune.
 The long period of her infancy was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of Italy, the neighbours and enemies of the rising city.
 In the strength and ardour of youth she sustained the storms of war, carried her victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains, and brought home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe.
 At length, verging towards old age, and sometimes conquering by the terror only of her name, she sought the blessings of ease and tranquillity.
 The VENERABLE CITY, which had trampled on the necks of the fiercest nations, and established a system of laws, the perpetual guardians of justice and freedom, was content, like a wise and wealthy parent, to devolve on the Caesars, her favourite sons, the care of governing her ample patrimony.
 (35) A secure and profound peace, such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of Numa, succeeded to the tumults of a republic; while <GPE>Rome</GPE> was still adored as the queen of the earth, and the subject nations still reverenced the name of the people and the majesty of the senate.
 But this native splendour (continues Ammianus) is degraded and sullied by the conduct of some nobles, who, unmindful of their own dignity and of that of their country, assume an unbounded licence of vice and folly.
 They contend with each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames, and curiously select or invent the most lofty and sonorous appellations — <PERSON>Reburrus</PERSON> or Fabunius, <PERSON>Pagonius</PERSON> or <PERSON>Tarrasius</PERSON> (36) which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and respect.
 From a vain ambition of perpetuating their memory, they affect to multiply their likeness in statues of bronze and marble; nor are they satisfied unless those statues are covered with plates of gold; an honourable distinction, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> granted to <PERSON>Acilius</PERSON> the consul, after he had subdued by his arms and counsels the power of king Antiochus.
 The ostentation of displaying, of magnifying perhaps, the rent roll of the estates which they possess in all the provinces, from the rising to the setting sun, provokes the just resentment of every man who recollects that their poor and invincible ancestors were not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers by the delicacy of their food or the splendour of their apparel.
 But the modern nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the loftiness of their chariots,(37) and the weighty magnificence of their dress.
 Their long robes of silk and purple float in the wind; and as they are agitated, by art or accident, they occasionally discover the under garments, the rich tunics, embroidered with the figures of various animals.
 (38) Followed by a train of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> servants, and tearing up the pavement, they move along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they travelled with post-horses and the example of the senators is boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies, whose covered carriages are continually driving round the immense space of the city and suburbs.
 Whenever these persons of high distinction condescend to visit the public baths, they assume, on their entrance, a tone of loud and insolent command, and appropriate to their own use the conveniences which were designed for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 If, in these places of mixed and general resort, they meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures, they express their affection by a tender embrace, while they proudly decline the salutations of their fellow-citizens, who are not permitted to aspire above the honour of kissing their hands or their knees.
 As soon as they have indulged themselves in the refreshment of the bath, they resume their rings and the other ensigns of their dignity, select from their private wardrobe of the finest linen, such as might suffice for a dozen persons, the garments the most agreeable to their fancy, and maintain till their departure the same haughty demeanour, which perhaps might have been excused in the great <PERSON>Marcellus</PERSON> after the conquest of Syracuse.
 Sometimes indeed these heroes undertake more arduous achievements: they visit their estates in Italy, and procure themselves, by the toil of servile hands, the amusements of the chase.
 (39) If at any time, but more especially on a hot day, they have courage to sail in their painted galleys from the Lucrine lake (40) to their elegant villas on the seacoast of <LOC>Puteoli</LOC> and Caieta, (41) they compare their own expeditions to the marches of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Alexander.
 Yet should a fly presume to settle on the silken folds of their gilded umbrellas, should a sunbeam penetrate through some unguarded and imperceptible chink, they deplore their intolerable hardships, and lament in affected language that they were not born in the land of the Cimmerians, (42) the regions of eternal darkness.
 In these journeys into the country (43) the whole body of the household marches with their master.
 In the same manner as the cavalry and infantry, the heavy and the light armed troops, the advanced guard and the rear, are marshalled by the skill of their military leaders, so the domestic officers, who bear a rod as an ensign of authority, distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves and attendants.
 The baggage and wardrobe move in the front, and are immediately followed by a multitude of cooks and inferior ministers employed in the service of the kitchens and of the table.
 The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of slaves, increased by the accidental concourse of idle or dependent plebeians.
 The rear is closed by the favourite band of eunuchs, distributed from age to youth, according to the order of seniority.
 Their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of the indignant spectators, who are ready to execrate the memory of <NORP>Semiramis</NORP> for the cruel art which she invented of frustrating the purposes of nature, and of blasting in the bud the hopes of future generations.
 In the exercise of domestic jurisdiction the nobles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> express an exquisite sensibility for any personal injury, and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human species.
 When they have called for warm water, if a slave has been tardy in his obedience, he is instantly chastised with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> lashes; but should the same slave commit a wilful murder, the master will mildly observe that he is a worthless fellow, but that if he repeats the offence he shall not escape punishment.
 Hospitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans; and every stranger who could plead either merit or misfortune was relieved or rewarded by their generosity.
 At present, if a foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the proud and wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> audience with such warm professions and such kind inquiries, that he retires enchanted with the affability of his illustrious friend, and full of regret that he had so long delayed his journey to Rome, the native seat of manners as well as of empire.
 Secure of a favourable reception, he repeats his visit the ensuing day, and is mortified by the discovery that his person, his name, and his country are already forgotten.
 If he still has resolution to persevere, he is gradually numbered in the train of dependents, and obtains the permission to pay his assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty patron, incapable of gratitude or friendship, who scarcely deigns remark his presence, his departure, or his return.
 Whenever the rich prepare a solemn and popular entertainment, (44) whenever they celebrate with profuse and pernicious luxury their private banquets, the choice of the guests is the subject of anxious deliberation.
 The modest, the sober, and the learned are seldom preferred and the nomenclators, who are commonly swayed by interested motives, have the address to insert in the list of invitations the obscure names of the most worthless of mankind.
 But the frequent and familiar companions of the great are those parasites who practise the most useful of all arts, the art of flattery; who eagerly applaud each word and every action of their immortal patron; gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated pavements, and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit.
 At the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tables the birds, the squirrels, (45) or the fish, which appear of an uncommon size are contemplated with curious attention; a pair of scales is accurately applied to ascertain their real weight and, while the more rational guests are disgusted by the vain and tedious repetition, notaries are summoned to attest by an authentic record the truth of such a marvellous event.
 Another method of introduction into the houses and society of the great is derived from the profession of gaming, or, as it is more politely styled, of play.
 The confederates are united by a strict and indissoluble bond of friendship, or rather of conspiracy; a superior degree of skill in the <NORP>Tesserarian</NORP> art (which may be interpreted the game of dice and tables (46)) is a sure road to wealth and reputation.
 A master of that sublime science, who in a supper or assembly is placed below a magistrate, displays in his countenance the surprise and indignation which <PERSON>Cato</PERSON> might be supposed to feel when he was refused the praetorship by the votes of a capricious people.
 The acquisition of knowledge seldom engages the curiosity of the nobles, who abhor the fatigue and disdain the advantages of study; and the only books which they peruse are the Satires of Juvenal, and the verbose and fabulous histories of Marius Maximus.
 (47) The libraries which they have inherited from their fathers are secluded, like dreary sepulchres, from the light of day.
 (48) But the costly instruments of the theatre, flutes, and enormous lyres, and hydraulic organs, are constructed for their use; and the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly repeated in the palaces of Rome.
 In those palaces sound is preferred to sense, and the care of the body to that of the mind.
 It is allowed as a salutary maxim, that the light and frivolous suspicion of a contagious malady is of sufficient weight to excuse the visits of the most intimate friends; and even the servants who are despatched to make the decent inquiries are not suffered to return home till they have undergone the ceremony of a previous ablution.
 Yet this selfish and unmanly delicacy occasionally yields to the more imperious passion of avarice.
 The prospect of gain will urge a rich and gouty senator as far as Spoleto; every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is subdued by the hopes of an inheritance, or even of a legacy; and a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the Romans.
 The art of obtaining the signature of a favourable testament, and sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution, is perfectly understood; and it has happened that in the same house, though in different apartments, a husband and a wife, with the laudable design of over-reaching each other, have summoned their respective lawyers, to declare at the same time their mutual but contradictory intentions.
 The distress which follows and chastises extravagant luxury often reduces the great to the use of the most humiliating expedients.
 When they desire to borrow, they employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the comedy; but when they are called upon to pay, they assume the royal and tragic declamation of the grandsons of Hercules.
 If the demand is repeated, they readily procure some trusty sycophant, instructed to maintain a charge of poison, or magic, against the insolent creditor, who is seldom released from prison till he has signed a discharge of the whole debt.
 These vices, which degrade the moral character of the Romans, are mixed with a puerile superstition that disgraces their understanding.
 They listen with confidence to the predictions of haruspices, who pretend to read in the entrails of victims the signs of future greatness and prosperity; and there are many who do not presume either to bathe or to dine, or to appear in public, till they have diligently consulted, according to the rules of astrology, the situation of <LOC>Mercury</LOC> and the aspect of the moon.
 (49) It is singular enough that this vain credulity may often be discovered among the profane sceptics who impiously doubt or deny the existence of a celestial power.
" State and character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people In populous cities, which are the seat of commerce and manufactures, the middle ranks of inhabitants, who derive their subsistence from the dexterity or labour of their hands, are commonly the most prolific, the most useful, and; in that sense, the most respectable part of the community.
 But the plebeians of Rome, who disdained such sedentary and servile arts, had been oppressed from the earliest times by the weight of debt and usury, and the husbandman, during the term of his military service, was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm.
 (50) The lands of Italy, which had been originally divided among the families of free and indigent proprietors, were insensibly purchased or usurped by the avarice of the nobles; and in the age which preceded the fall of the republic, it was computed that only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> citizens were possessed of any independent substance.
(51) Yet as long as the people bestowed by their suffrages the honours of the state, the command of the legions, and the administration of wealthy provinces, their conscious pride alleviated in some measure the hardships of poverty and their wants were seasonably supplied by the ambitious liberality of the candidates, who aspired to secure a venal majority in the <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> tribes, or the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and ninety-three centuries, of Rome.
 But when the prodigal commons had imprudently alienated not only the use, but the inheritance, of power, they sunk, under the reign of the Caesars, into a vile and wretched populace, which must, in a few generations, have been totally extinguished, if it had not been continually recruited by the manumission of slaves and the influx of strangers.
 As early as the time of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> it was the just complaint of the ingenuous natives that the capital had attracted the vices of the universe and the manners of the most opposite nations.
 The intemperance of the Gauls, the cunning and levity of the Greeks, the savage obstinacy of the <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> and Jews, the servile temper of the Asiatics, and the dissolute, effeminate prostitution of the Syrians, were mingled in the various multitude, which, under the proud and false denomination of Romans, presumed to despise their fellow-subjects, and even their sovereigns, who dwelt beyond the precincts of the ETERNAL CITY.
(52) Public distribution of bread, bacon, oil, wine, etc Yet the name of that city was still pronounced with respect: the frequent and capricious tumults of its inhabitants were indulged with impunity; and the successors of Constantine, instead of crushing the last remains of the democracy by the strong arm of military power, embraced the mild policy of Augustus, and studied to relieve the poverty and to amuse the idleness of an innumerable people.
 (53)I.
 For the convenience of the lazy plebeians, the monthly distributions of corn were converted into a <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of bread; a great number of ovens were constructed and maintained at the public expense; and at the appointed hour, each citizen, who was furnished with a ticket, ascended the flight of steps which had been assigned to his peculiar <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> or division, and received, either as a gift or at a very low price, a loaf of bread of the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds for the use of his family.
 II.
The forests of Lucania, whose acorns fattened large droves of wild hogs, (54) afforded, as a species of tribute, a plentiful supply of cheap and wholesome meat.
 During <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months of the year a regular allowance of bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens; and the annual consumption of the capital, at a time when it was much declined from its former lustre, was ascertained, by an edict of Valentinian the Third, at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds.
 (55) III.
In the manners of antiquity the use of oil was indispensable for the lamp as well as for the bath, and the annual tax which was imposed on <LOC>Africa</LOC> for the benefit of <GPE>Rome</GPE> amounted to the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions of pounds, to the measure, perhaps, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> English gallons.
 IV.
 The anxiety of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to provide the metropolis with sufficient plenty of corn was not extended beyond that necessary article of human subsistence; and when the popular clamour accused the dearness and scarcity of wine, a proclamation was issued by the grave reformer to remind his subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst, since the aqueducts of <PERSON>Agrippa</PERSON> had introduced into the city so many copious streams of pure and salubrious water.
(56) This rigid sobriety was insensibly relaxed; and, although the generous design of Aurelian(57) does not appear to have been executed in its full extent, the use of wine was allowed on very easy and liberal terms.
 The administration of the public cellars was delegated to a magistrate of honourable rank; and a considerable part of the vintage of <GPE>Campania</GPE> was reserved for the fortunate inhabitants of Rome.
 Use of the public baths.
 The stupendous aqueducts, so justly celebrated by the praises of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> himself, replenished the Thermae, or baths, which had been constructed in every part of the city with <NORP>Imperial</NORP> magnificence.
 The baths of Antoninus Caracalla, which were open, at stated hours, for the indiscriminate service of the senators and the people, contained above sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> seats of marble; and more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> were reckoned in the baths of Diocletian.
 (58) The walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious mosaics, that imitated the art of the pencil in the elegance of design and the variety of colours.
 The <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> granite was beautifully encrusted with the precious green marble of Numidia; the perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the capacious basins through so many wide mouths of bright and massy silver; and the meanest <NORP>Roman</NORP> could purchase, with a small copper coin, the <DATE>daily</DATE> enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury which might excite the envy of the kings of Asia.
(59) From these stately palaces issued a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians, without shoes and without a mantle; who loitered away whole days in the street or <ORG>Forum</ORG> to hear news and to hold disputes who dissipated in extravagant gaming the miserable pittance of their wives and children; and spent the <TIME>hours</TIME> of the night in obscure taverns and brothels in the indulgence of gross and vulgar sensuality.
(60) Games and spectacles But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles.
 The piety of <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people still considered the <FAC>Circus</FAC> as their home, their temple, and the seat of the republic.
 The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secure their places, and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos.
 From the morning to the evening, careless of the sun or of the rain, the spectators, who sometimes amounted to the number of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand, remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the colours which they espoused; and the happiness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> appeared to hang on the event of a race.
 (61) The same immoderate ardour inspired their clamours and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation.
 These representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste, and perhaps of virtue.
 But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans, who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius,(62) had been almost totally silent since the fall of the republic; (63) and their place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and splendid pageantry.
 The pantomimes, (64) who maintained their reputation from the age of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century, expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people.
 The vast and magnificent theatres of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were filled by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> female dancers, and by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> singers, with the masters of the respective choruses.
 Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed, that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts.
(65) Populous of <GPE>Rome</GPE> It is said that the foolish curiosity of <GPE>Elagabalus</GPE> attempted to discover, from the quantity of spiders' webs, the number of the inhabitants of Rome.
 A more rational method of inquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who could easily have resolved a question so important for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government and so interesting to succeeding ages.
 The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the common average, we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which should destroy the extravagant assertions of critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers.
(66) The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances, which, slight and imperfect as they are, may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome.
 I.
 When the capital of the empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal to twenty-one miles.
(67) It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle, the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference.
 II.
 The architect Vitruvius, who flourished in the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, observes that the innumerable habitations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air.
 (68) But the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the walls of <GPE>Rome</GPE> should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground.
(69) III.
 <PERSON>Juvenal</PERSON> (70) laments, as it should seem from his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay, from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase in the little towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> a cheerful, commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
 House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces and gardens; but the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was crowded into a narrow space; and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided, as it is still the custom of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and other cities, among several families of plebeians.
 IV.
 The total number of houses in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of <GPE>Rome</GPE> composed under the reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-two.
(71) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes of domus and of insulae, into which they are divided, include all the habitations of the capital, of every rank and condition, from the marble palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodginghouse where the poet <PERSON>Codrus</PERSON> and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the tiles.
 If we adopt the same average which, under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris,(72) and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand: a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe.
(73) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> seige of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408.
 Such was the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> under the reign of Honorius, at the time when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
 (74) By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an assault, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> encompassed the walls, commanded the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tiber, from which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world; but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim.
 Perhaps in the person of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor; they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 Actuated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city.
 That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine.
 Famine.
 The <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion.
 The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband.
(75) But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves.
 The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain.
 The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger.
 A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers (such was the horrid conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast), even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants!(76)Plague.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy, the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease.
 The assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported, for some time, the fainting resolution of the Romans, Superstition.
 till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a preternatural deliverance.
 Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or fanaticism of some <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> diviners, that, by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians.
(77) The important secret was communicated to Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St.
 Peter is accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates; the majority of that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> displeasure, refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism.
(78) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, "If such, O king! are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?" "YOUR LIVES," replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Wealth of <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles.
 "The marbles of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> palace," were used as a proverbial expression of opulence and splendour;(23) but the nobles and senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> aspired in due gradation to imitate that illustrious family.
 The accurate description of the city, which was composed in the <GPE>Theodosian</GPE> age, enumerates <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty houses, the residence of wealthy and honourable citizens.
 (24) Many of these stately mansions might almost excuse the exaggeration of the poet—that <GPE>Rome</GPE> contained a multitude of palaces, and that each palace was equal to a city, since it included within its own precincts everything which could be subservient either to use or luxury: markets, hippodromes, temples, fountains, baths, porticos, shady groves, and artificial aviaries.
(25) The historian Olympiodorus, who represents the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> when it was besieged by the Goths,(26) continues to observe that several of the richest senators received from their estates an annual income of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling; without computing the stated provision of corn and wine, which, had they been sold, might have equalled in value <CARDINAL>one-third</CARDINAL> of the money.
 Compared to this immoderate wealth, an ordinary revenue of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds of gold might be considered as no more than adequate to the dignity of the <NORP>senatorian</NORP> rank, which required many expenses of a public and ostentatious kind.
 Several examples are recorded in the age of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> of vain and popular nobles who celebrated the year of their praetorship by a festival which lasted <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days and cost above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling.
(27) The estates of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, which so far exceed the proportion of modern wealth, were not confined to the limits of Italy.
 Their possessions extended far beyond the <NORP>Ionian</NORP> and <NORP>Agean</NORP> seas to the most distant provinces: the city of Nicopolis, which <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> had founded as an eternal monument of the <NORP>Actian</NORP> victory, was the property of the devout Paula;(28) and it is observed by Seneca, that the rivers which had divided hostile nations now flowed through the lands of private citizens.
(29) According to their temper and circumstances, the estates of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were either cultivated by the labour of their slaves, or granted, for a certain and stipulated rent, to the industrious farmer.
 The economical writers of antiquity strenuously recommend the former method wherever it may be practicable but if the object should be removed by its distance or magnitude from the immediate eye of the master, they prefer the active care of an old hereditary tenant, attached to the soil and interested in the produce, to the mercenary administration of a negligent, perhaps an unfaithful steward.
(30) Their manners The opulent nobles of an immense capital, who were never excited by the pursuit of military glory, and seldom engaged in the occupations of civil government, naturally resigned their leisure to the business and amusements of private life.
 At <GPE>Rome</GPE> commerce was always held in contempt; but the senators, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age of the republic, increased their patrimony and multiplied their clients by the lucrative practice of usury, and the obsolete laws were eluded or violated by the mutual inclinations and interest of both parties.
 (31) A considerable mass of treasure must always have existed at Rome, either in the current coin of the empire, or in the form of gold and silver plate; and there were many sideboards in the time of Pliny which contained more solid silver than had been transported by <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> from vanquished Carthage.
(32) The greater part of the nobles, who dissipated their fortunes in profuse luxury, found themselves poor in the midst of wealth, and idle in a constant round of dissipation.
 Their desires were continually gratified by the labour of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> hands; of the numerous train of their domestic slaves, who were actuated by the fear of punishment; and of the various professions of artificers and merchants, who were more powerfully impelled by the hopes of gain.
 The ancients were destitute of many of the conveniences of life which have been invented or improved by the progress of industry; and the plenty of glass and linen has diffused more real comforts among the modern nations of <LOC>Europe</LOC> than the senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> could derive from all the refinements of pompous or sensual luxury.
(33) Their luxury and their manners have been the subject of minute and laborious disquisition; but as such inquiries would divert me too long from the design of the present work, I shall produce an authentic state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and its inhabitants which is more peculiarly applicable to the period of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion.
 <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus, who prudently chose the capital of the empire as the residence the best adapted to the historian of his own times, has mixed with the narrative of public events a lively representation of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant.
 The judicious reader will not always approve the asperity of censure, the choice of circumstances, or the style of expression; he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices and personal resentments which soured the temper of <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> himself; but he will surely observe, with philosophic curiosity, the interesting and original picture of the manners of Rome.
(34) Character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles, by <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus "The greatness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> (such is the language of the historian) was founded on the rare and almost incredible alliance of virtue and of fortune.
 The long period of her infancy was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of Italy, the neighbours and enemies of the rising city.
 In the strength and ardour of youth she sustained the storms of war, carried her victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains, and brought home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe.
 At length, verging towards old age, and sometimes conquering by the terror only of her name, she sought the blessings of ease and tranquillity.
 The VENERABLE CITY, which had trampled on the necks of the fiercest nations, and established a system of laws, the perpetual guardians of justice and freedom, was content, like a wise and wealthy parent, to devolve on the Caesars, her favourite sons, the care of governing her ample patrimony.
 (35) A secure and profound peace, such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of Numa, succeeded to the tumults of a republic; while <GPE>Rome</GPE> was still adored as the queen of the earth, and the subject nations still reverenced the name of the people and the majesty of the senate.
 But this native splendour (continues Ammianus) is degraded and sullied by the conduct of some nobles, who, unmindful of their own dignity and of that of their country, assume an unbounded licence of vice and folly.
 They contend with each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames, and curiously select or invent the most lofty and sonorous appellations — <PERSON>Reburrus</PERSON> or Fabunius, <PERSON>Pagonius</PERSON> or <PERSON>Tarrasius</PERSON> (36) which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and respect.
 From a vain ambition of perpetuating their memory, they affect to multiply their likeness in statues of bronze and marble; nor are they satisfied unless those statues are covered with plates of gold; an honourable distinction, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> granted to <PERSON>Acilius</PERSON> the consul, after he had subdued by his arms and counsels the power of king Antiochus.
 The ostentation of displaying, of magnifying perhaps, the rent roll of the estates which they possess in all the provinces, from the rising to the setting sun, provokes the just resentment of every man who recollects that their poor and invincible ancestors were not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers by the delicacy of their food or the splendour of their apparel.
 But the modern nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the loftiness of their chariots,(37) and the weighty magnificence of their dress.
 Their long robes of silk and purple float in the wind; and as they are agitated, by art or accident, they occasionally discover the under garments, the rich tunics, embroidered with the figures of various animals.
 (38) Followed by a train of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> servants, and tearing up the pavement, they move along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they travelled with post-horses and the example of the senators is boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies, whose covered carriages are continually driving round the immense space of the city and suburbs.
 Whenever these persons of high distinction condescend to visit the public baths, they assume, on their entrance, a tone of loud and insolent command, and appropriate to their own use the conveniences which were designed for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 If, in these places of mixed and general resort, they meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures, they express their affection by a tender embrace, while they proudly decline the salutations of their fellow-citizens, who are not permitted to aspire above the honour of kissing their hands or their knees.
 As soon as they have indulged themselves in the refreshment of the bath, they resume their rings and the other ensigns of their dignity, select from their private wardrobe of the finest linen, such as might suffice for a dozen persons, the garments the most agreeable to their fancy, and maintain till their departure the same haughty demeanour, which perhaps might have been excused in the great <PERSON>Marcellus</PERSON> after the conquest of Syracuse.
 Sometimes indeed these heroes undertake more arduous achievements: they visit their estates in Italy, and procure themselves, by the toil of servile hands, the amusements of the chase.
 (39) If at any time, but more especially on a hot day, they have courage to sail in their painted galleys from the Lucrine lake (40) to their elegant villas on the seacoast of <LOC>Puteoli</LOC> and Caieta, (41) they compare their own expeditions to the marches of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Alexander.
 Yet should a fly presume to settle on the silken folds of their gilded umbrellas, should a sunbeam penetrate through some unguarded and imperceptible chink, they deplore their intolerable hardships, and lament in affected language that they were not born in the land of the Cimmerians, (42) the regions of eternal darkness.
 In these journeys into the country (43) the whole body of the household marches with their master.
 In the same manner as the cavalry and infantry, the heavy and the light armed troops, the advanced guard and the rear, are marshalled by the skill of their military leaders, so the domestic officers, who bear a rod as an ensign of authority, distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves and attendants.
 The baggage and wardrobe move in the front, and are immediately followed by a multitude of cooks and inferior ministers employed in the service of the kitchens and of the table.
 The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of slaves, increased by the accidental concourse of idle or dependent plebeians.
 The rear is closed by the favourite band of eunuchs, distributed from age to youth, according to the order of seniority.
 Their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of the indignant spectators, who are ready to execrate the memory of <NORP>Semiramis</NORP> for the cruel art which she invented of frustrating the purposes of nature, and of blasting in the bud the hopes of future generations.
 In the exercise of domestic jurisdiction the nobles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> express an exquisite sensibility for any personal injury, and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human species.
 When they have called for warm water, if a slave has been tardy in his obedience, he is instantly chastised with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> lashes; but should the same slave commit a wilful murder, the master will mildly observe that he is a worthless fellow, but that if he repeats the offence he shall not escape punishment.
 Hospitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans; and every stranger who could plead either merit or misfortune was relieved or rewarded by their generosity.
 At present, if a foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the proud and wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> audience with such warm professions and such kind inquiries, that he retires enchanted with the affability of his illustrious friend, and full of regret that he had so long delayed his journey to Rome, the native seat of manners as well as of empire.
 Secure of a favourable reception, he repeats his visit the ensuing day, and is mortified by the discovery that his person, his name, and his country are already forgotten.
 If he still has resolution to persevere, he is gradually numbered in the train of dependents, and obtains the permission to pay his assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty patron, incapable of gratitude or friendship, who scarcely deigns remark his presence, his departure, or his return.
 Whenever the rich prepare a solemn and popular entertainment, (44) whenever they celebrate with profuse and pernicious luxury their private banquets, the choice of the guests is the subject of anxious deliberation.
 The modest, the sober, and the learned are seldom preferred and the nomenclators, who are commonly swayed by interested motives, have the address to insert in the list of invitations the obscure names of the most worthless of mankind.
 But the frequent and familiar companions of the great are those parasites who practise the most useful of all arts, the art of flattery; who eagerly applaud each word and every action of their immortal patron; gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated pavements, and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit.
 At the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tables the birds, the squirrels, (45) or the fish, which appear of an uncommon size are contemplated with curious attention; a pair of scales is accurately applied to ascertain their real weight and, while the more rational guests are disgusted by the vain and tedious repetition, notaries are summoned to attest by an authentic record the truth of such a marvellous event.
 Another method of introduction into the houses and society of the great is derived from the profession of gaming, or, as it is more politely styled, of play.
 The confederates are united by a strict and indissoluble bond of friendship, or rather of conspiracy; a superior degree of skill in the <NORP>Tesserarian</NORP> art (which may be interpreted the game of dice and tables (46)) is a sure road to wealth and reputation.
 A master of that sublime science, who in a supper or assembly is placed below a magistrate, displays in his countenance the surprise and indignation which <PERSON>Cato</PERSON> might be supposed to feel when he was refused the praetorship by the votes of a capricious people.
 The acquisition of knowledge seldom engages the curiosity of the nobles, who abhor the fatigue and disdain the advantages of study; and the only books which they peruse are the Satires of Juvenal, and the verbose and fabulous histories of Marius Maximus.
 (47) The libraries which they have inherited from their fathers are secluded, like dreary sepulchres, from the light of day.
 (48) But the costly instruments of the theatre, flutes, and enormous lyres, and hydraulic organs, are constructed for their use; and the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly repeated in the palaces of Rome.
 In those palaces sound is preferred to sense, and the care of the body to that of the mind.
 It is allowed as a salutary maxim, that the light and frivolous suspicion of a contagious malady is of sufficient weight to excuse the visits of the most intimate friends; and even the servants who are despatched to make the decent inquiries are not suffered to return home till they have undergone the ceremony of a previous ablution.
 Yet this selfish and unmanly delicacy occasionally yields to the more imperious passion of avarice.
 The prospect of gain will urge a rich and gouty senator as far as Spoleto; every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is subdued by the hopes of an inheritance, or even of a legacy; and a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the Romans.
 The art of obtaining the signature of a favourable testament, and sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution, is perfectly understood; and it has happened that in the same house, though in different apartments, a husband and a wife, with the laudable design of over-reaching each other, have summoned their respective lawyers, to declare at the same time their mutual but contradictory intentions.
 The distress which follows and chastises extravagant luxury often reduces the great to the use of the most humiliating expedients.
 When they desire to borrow, they employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the comedy; but when they are called upon to pay, they assume the royal and tragic declamation of the grandsons of Hercules.
 If the demand is repeated, they readily procure some trusty sycophant, instructed to maintain a charge of poison, or magic, against the insolent creditor, who is seldom released from prison till he has signed a discharge of the whole debt.
 These vices, which degrade the moral character of the Romans, are mixed with a puerile superstition that disgraces their understanding.
 They listen with confidence to the predictions of haruspices, who pretend to read in the entrails of victims the signs of future greatness and prosperity; and there are many who do not presume either to bathe or to dine, or to appear in public, till they have diligently consulted, according to the rules of astrology, the situation of <LOC>Mercury</LOC> and the aspect of the moon.
 (49) It is singular enough that this vain credulity may often be discovered among the profane sceptics who impiously doubt or deny the existence of a celestial power.
" State and character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people In populous cities, which are the seat of commerce and manufactures, the middle ranks of inhabitants, who derive their subsistence from the dexterity or labour of their hands, are commonly the most prolific, the most useful, and; in that sense, the most respectable part of the community.
 But the plebeians of Rome, who disdained such sedentary and servile arts, had been oppressed from the earliest times by the weight of debt and usury, and the husbandman, during the term of his military service, was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm.
 (50) The lands of Italy, which had been originally divided among the families of free and indigent proprietors, were insensibly purchased or usurped by the avarice of the nobles; and in the age which preceded the fall of the republic, it was computed that only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> citizens were possessed of any independent substance.
(51) Yet as long as the people bestowed by their suffrages the honours of the state, the command of the legions, and the administration of wealthy provinces, their conscious pride alleviated in some measure the hardships of poverty and their wants were seasonably supplied by the ambitious liberality of the candidates, who aspired to secure a venal majority in the <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> tribes, or the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and ninety-three centuries, of Rome.
 But when the prodigal commons had imprudently alienated not only the use, but the inheritance, of power, they sunk, under the reign of the Caesars, into a vile and wretched populace, which must, in a few generations, have been totally extinguished, if it had not been continually recruited by the manumission of slaves and the influx of strangers.
 As early as the time of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> it was the just complaint of the ingenuous natives that the capital had attracted the vices of the universe and the manners of the most opposite nations.
 The intemperance of the Gauls, the cunning and levity of the Greeks, the savage obstinacy of the <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> and Jews, the servile temper of the Asiatics, and the dissolute, effeminate prostitution of the Syrians, were mingled in the various multitude, which, under the proud and false denomination of Romans, presumed to despise their fellow-subjects, and even their sovereigns, who dwelt beyond the precincts of the ETERNAL CITY.
(52) Public distribution of bread, bacon, oil, wine, etc Yet the name of that city was still pronounced with respect: the frequent and capricious tumults of its inhabitants were indulged with impunity; and the successors of Constantine, instead of crushing the last remains of the democracy by the strong arm of military power, embraced the mild policy of Augustus, and studied to relieve the poverty and to amuse the idleness of an innumerable people.
 (53)I.
 For the convenience of the lazy plebeians, the monthly distributions of corn were converted into a <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of bread; a great number of ovens were constructed and maintained at the public expense; and at the appointed hour, each citizen, who was furnished with a ticket, ascended the flight of steps which had been assigned to his peculiar <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> or division, and received, either as a gift or at a very low price, a loaf of bread of the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds for the use of his family.
 II.
The forests of Lucania, whose acorns fattened large droves of wild hogs, (54) afforded, as a species of tribute, a plentiful supply of cheap and wholesome meat.
 During <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months of the year a regular allowance of bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens; and the annual consumption of the capital, at a time when it was much declined from its former lustre, was ascertained, by an edict of Valentinian the Third, at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds.
 (55) III.
In the manners of antiquity the use of oil was indispensable for the lamp as well as for the bath, and the annual tax which was imposed on <LOC>Africa</LOC> for the benefit of <GPE>Rome</GPE> amounted to the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions of pounds, to the measure, perhaps, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> English gallons.
 IV.
 The anxiety of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to provide the metropolis with sufficient plenty of corn was not extended beyond that necessary article of human subsistence; and when the popular clamour accused the dearness and scarcity of wine, a proclamation was issued by the grave reformer to remind his subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst, since the aqueducts of <PERSON>Agrippa</PERSON> had introduced into the city so many copious streams of pure and salubrious water.
(56) This rigid sobriety was insensibly relaxed; and, although the generous design of Aurelian(57) does not appear to have been executed in its full extent, the use of wine was allowed on very easy and liberal terms.
 The administration of the public cellars was delegated to a magistrate of honourable rank; and a considerable part of the vintage of <GPE>Campania</GPE> was reserved for the fortunate inhabitants of Rome.
 Use of the public baths.
 The stupendous aqueducts, so justly celebrated by the praises of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> himself, replenished the Thermae, or baths, which had been constructed in every part of the city with <NORP>Imperial</NORP> magnificence.
 The baths of Antoninus Caracalla, which were open, at stated hours, for the indiscriminate service of the senators and the people, contained above sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> seats of marble; and more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> were reckoned in the baths of Diocletian.
 (58) The walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious mosaics, that imitated the art of the pencil in the elegance of design and the variety of colours.
 The <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> granite was beautifully encrusted with the precious green marble of Numidia; the perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the capacious basins through so many wide mouths of bright and massy silver; and the meanest <NORP>Roman</NORP> could purchase, with a small copper coin, the <DATE>daily</DATE> enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury which might excite the envy of the kings of Asia.
(59) From these stately palaces issued a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians, without shoes and without a mantle; who loitered away whole days in the street or <ORG>Forum</ORG> to hear news and to hold disputes who dissipated in extravagant gaming the miserable pittance of their wives and children; and spent the <TIME>hours</TIME> of the night in obscure taverns and brothels in the indulgence of gross and vulgar sensuality.
(60) Games and spectacles But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles.
 The piety of <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people still considered the <FAC>Circus</FAC> as their home, their temple, and the seat of the republic.
 The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secure their places, and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos.
 From the morning to the evening, careless of the sun or of the rain, the spectators, who sometimes amounted to the number of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand, remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the colours which they espoused; and the happiness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> appeared to hang on the event of a race.
 (61) The same immoderate ardour inspired their clamours and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation.
 These representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste, and perhaps of virtue.
 But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans, who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius,(62) had been almost totally silent since the fall of the republic; (63) and their place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and splendid pageantry.
 The pantomimes, (64) who maintained their reputation from the age of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century, expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people.
 The vast and magnificent theatres of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were filled by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> female dancers, and by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> singers, with the masters of the respective choruses.
 Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed, that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts.
(65) Populous of <GPE>Rome</GPE> It is said that the foolish curiosity of <GPE>Elagabalus</GPE> attempted to discover, from the quantity of spiders' webs, the number of the inhabitants of Rome.
 A more rational method of inquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who could easily have resolved a question so important for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government and so interesting to succeeding ages.
 The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the common average, we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which should destroy the extravagant assertions of critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers.
(66) The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances, which, slight and imperfect as they are, may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome.
 I.
 When the capital of the empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal to twenty-one miles.
(67) It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle, the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference.
 II.
 The architect Vitruvius, who flourished in the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, observes that the innumerable habitations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air.
 (68) But the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the walls of <GPE>Rome</GPE> should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground.
(69) III.
 <PERSON>Juvenal</PERSON> (70) laments, as it should seem from his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay, from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase in the little towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> a cheerful, commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
 House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces and gardens; but the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was crowded into a narrow space; and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided, as it is still the custom of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and other cities, among several families of plebeians.
 IV.
 The total number of houses in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of <GPE>Rome</GPE> composed under the reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-two.
(71) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes of domus and of insulae, into which they are divided, include all the habitations of the capital, of every rank and condition, from the marble palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodginghouse where the poet <PERSON>Codrus</PERSON> and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the tiles.
 If we adopt the same average which, under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris,(72) and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand: a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe.
(73) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> seige of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408.
 Such was the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> under the reign of Honorius, at the time when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
 (74) By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an assault, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> encompassed the walls, commanded the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tiber, from which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world; but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim.
 Perhaps in the person of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor; they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 Actuated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city.
 That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine.
 Famine.
 The <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion.
 The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband.
(75) But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves.
 The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain.
 The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger.
 A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers (such was the horrid conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast), even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants!(76)Plague.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy, the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease.
 The assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported, for some time, the fainting resolution of the Romans, Superstition.
 till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a preternatural deliverance.
 Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or fanaticism of some <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> diviners, that, by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians.
(77) The important secret was communicated to Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St.
 Peter is accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates; the majority of that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> displeasure, refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism.
(78) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, "If such, O king! are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?" "YOUR LIVES," replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Their manners The opulent nobles of an immense capital, who were never excited by the pursuit of military glory, and seldom engaged in the occupations of civil government, naturally resigned their leisure to the business and amusements of private life.
 At <GPE>Rome</GPE> commerce was always held in contempt; but the senators, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age of the republic, increased their patrimony and multiplied their clients by the lucrative practice of usury, and the obsolete laws were eluded or violated by the mutual inclinations and interest of both parties.
 (31) A considerable mass of treasure must always have existed at Rome, either in the current coin of the empire, or in the form of gold and silver plate; and there were many sideboards in the time of Pliny which contained more solid silver than had been transported by <PERSON>Scipio</PERSON> from vanquished Carthage.
(32) The greater part of the nobles, who dissipated their fortunes in profuse luxury, found themselves poor in the midst of wealth, and idle in a constant round of dissipation.
 Their desires were continually gratified by the labour of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> hands; of the numerous train of their domestic slaves, who were actuated by the fear of punishment; and of the various professions of artificers and merchants, who were more powerfully impelled by the hopes of gain.
 The ancients were destitute of many of the conveniences of life which have been invented or improved by the progress of industry; and the plenty of glass and linen has diffused more real comforts among the modern nations of <LOC>Europe</LOC> than the senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> could derive from all the refinements of pompous or sensual luxury.
(33) Their luxury and their manners have been the subject of minute and laborious disquisition; but as such inquiries would divert me too long from the design of the present work, I shall produce an authentic state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and its inhabitants which is more peculiarly applicable to the period of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion.
 <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus, who prudently chose the capital of the empire as the residence the best adapted to the historian of his own times, has mixed with the narrative of public events a lively representation of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant.
 The judicious reader will not always approve the asperity of censure, the choice of circumstances, or the style of expression; he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices and personal resentments which soured the temper of <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> himself; but he will surely observe, with philosophic curiosity, the interesting and original picture of the manners of Rome.
(34) Character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles, by <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus "The greatness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> (such is the language of the historian) was founded on the rare and almost incredible alliance of virtue and of fortune.
 The long period of her infancy was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of Italy, the neighbours and enemies of the rising city.
 In the strength and ardour of youth she sustained the storms of war, carried her victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains, and brought home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe.
 At length, verging towards old age, and sometimes conquering by the terror only of her name, she sought the blessings of ease and tranquillity.
 The VENERABLE CITY, which had trampled on the necks of the fiercest nations, and established a system of laws, the perpetual guardians of justice and freedom, was content, like a wise and wealthy parent, to devolve on the Caesars, her favourite sons, the care of governing her ample patrimony.
 (35) A secure and profound peace, such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of Numa, succeeded to the tumults of a republic; while <GPE>Rome</GPE> was still adored as the queen of the earth, and the subject nations still reverenced the name of the people and the majesty of the senate.
 But this native splendour (continues Ammianus) is degraded and sullied by the conduct of some nobles, who, unmindful of their own dignity and of that of their country, assume an unbounded licence of vice and folly.
 They contend with each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames, and curiously select or invent the most lofty and sonorous appellations — <PERSON>Reburrus</PERSON> or Fabunius, <PERSON>Pagonius</PERSON> or <PERSON>Tarrasius</PERSON> (36) which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and respect.
 From a vain ambition of perpetuating their memory, they affect to multiply their likeness in statues of bronze and marble; nor are they satisfied unless those statues are covered with plates of gold; an honourable distinction, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> granted to <PERSON>Acilius</PERSON> the consul, after he had subdued by his arms and counsels the power of king Antiochus.
 The ostentation of displaying, of magnifying perhaps, the rent roll of the estates which they possess in all the provinces, from the rising to the setting sun, provokes the just resentment of every man who recollects that their poor and invincible ancestors were not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers by the delicacy of their food or the splendour of their apparel.
 But the modern nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the loftiness of their chariots,(37) and the weighty magnificence of their dress.
 Their long robes of silk and purple float in the wind; and as they are agitated, by art or accident, they occasionally discover the under garments, the rich tunics, embroidered with the figures of various animals.
 (38) Followed by a train of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> servants, and tearing up the pavement, they move along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they travelled with post-horses and the example of the senators is boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies, whose covered carriages are continually driving round the immense space of the city and suburbs.
 Whenever these persons of high distinction condescend to visit the public baths, they assume, on their entrance, a tone of loud and insolent command, and appropriate to their own use the conveniences which were designed for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 If, in these places of mixed and general resort, they meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures, they express their affection by a tender embrace, while they proudly decline the salutations of their fellow-citizens, who are not permitted to aspire above the honour of kissing their hands or their knees.
 As soon as they have indulged themselves in the refreshment of the bath, they resume their rings and the other ensigns of their dignity, select from their private wardrobe of the finest linen, such as might suffice for a dozen persons, the garments the most agreeable to their fancy, and maintain till their departure the same haughty demeanour, which perhaps might have been excused in the great <PERSON>Marcellus</PERSON> after the conquest of Syracuse.
 Sometimes indeed these heroes undertake more arduous achievements: they visit their estates in Italy, and procure themselves, by the toil of servile hands, the amusements of the chase.
 (39) If at any time, but more especially on a hot day, they have courage to sail in their painted galleys from the Lucrine lake (40) to their elegant villas on the seacoast of <LOC>Puteoli</LOC> and Caieta, (41) they compare their own expeditions to the marches of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Alexander.
 Yet should a fly presume to settle on the silken folds of their gilded umbrellas, should a sunbeam penetrate through some unguarded and imperceptible chink, they deplore their intolerable hardships, and lament in affected language that they were not born in the land of the Cimmerians, (42) the regions of eternal darkness.
 In these journeys into the country (43) the whole body of the household marches with their master.
 In the same manner as the cavalry and infantry, the heavy and the light armed troops, the advanced guard and the rear, are marshalled by the skill of their military leaders, so the domestic officers, who bear a rod as an ensign of authority, distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves and attendants.
 The baggage and wardrobe move in the front, and are immediately followed by a multitude of cooks and inferior ministers employed in the service of the kitchens and of the table.
 The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of slaves, increased by the accidental concourse of idle or dependent plebeians.
 The rear is closed by the favourite band of eunuchs, distributed from age to youth, according to the order of seniority.
 Their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of the indignant spectators, who are ready to execrate the memory of <NORP>Semiramis</NORP> for the cruel art which she invented of frustrating the purposes of nature, and of blasting in the bud the hopes of future generations.
 In the exercise of domestic jurisdiction the nobles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> express an exquisite sensibility for any personal injury, and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human species.
 When they have called for warm water, if a slave has been tardy in his obedience, he is instantly chastised with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> lashes; but should the same slave commit a wilful murder, the master will mildly observe that he is a worthless fellow, but that if he repeats the offence he shall not escape punishment.
 Hospitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans; and every stranger who could plead either merit or misfortune was relieved or rewarded by their generosity.
 At present, if a foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the proud and wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> audience with such warm professions and such kind inquiries, that he retires enchanted with the affability of his illustrious friend, and full of regret that he had so long delayed his journey to Rome, the native seat of manners as well as of empire.
 Secure of a favourable reception, he repeats his visit the ensuing day, and is mortified by the discovery that his person, his name, and his country are already forgotten.
 If he still has resolution to persevere, he is gradually numbered in the train of dependents, and obtains the permission to pay his assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty patron, incapable of gratitude or friendship, who scarcely deigns remark his presence, his departure, or his return.
 Whenever the rich prepare a solemn and popular entertainment, (44) whenever they celebrate with profuse and pernicious luxury their private banquets, the choice of the guests is the subject of anxious deliberation.
 The modest, the sober, and the learned are seldom preferred and the nomenclators, who are commonly swayed by interested motives, have the address to insert in the list of invitations the obscure names of the most worthless of mankind.
 But the frequent and familiar companions of the great are those parasites who practise the most useful of all arts, the art of flattery; who eagerly applaud each word and every action of their immortal patron; gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated pavements, and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit.
 At the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tables the birds, the squirrels, (45) or the fish, which appear of an uncommon size are contemplated with curious attention; a pair of scales is accurately applied to ascertain their real weight and, while the more rational guests are disgusted by the vain and tedious repetition, notaries are summoned to attest by an authentic record the truth of such a marvellous event.
 Another method of introduction into the houses and society of the great is derived from the profession of gaming, or, as it is more politely styled, of play.
 The confederates are united by a strict and indissoluble bond of friendship, or rather of conspiracy; a superior degree of skill in the <NORP>Tesserarian</NORP> art (which may be interpreted the game of dice and tables (46)) is a sure road to wealth and reputation.
 A master of that sublime science, who in a supper or assembly is placed below a magistrate, displays in his countenance the surprise and indignation which <PERSON>Cato</PERSON> might be supposed to feel when he was refused the praetorship by the votes of a capricious people.
 The acquisition of knowledge seldom engages the curiosity of the nobles, who abhor the fatigue and disdain the advantages of study; and the only books which they peruse are the Satires of Juvenal, and the verbose and fabulous histories of Marius Maximus.
 (47) The libraries which they have inherited from their fathers are secluded, like dreary sepulchres, from the light of day.
 (48) But the costly instruments of the theatre, flutes, and enormous lyres, and hydraulic organs, are constructed for their use; and the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly repeated in the palaces of Rome.
 In those palaces sound is preferred to sense, and the care of the body to that of the mind.
 It is allowed as a salutary maxim, that the light and frivolous suspicion of a contagious malady is of sufficient weight to excuse the visits of the most intimate friends; and even the servants who are despatched to make the decent inquiries are not suffered to return home till they have undergone the ceremony of a previous ablution.
 Yet this selfish and unmanly delicacy occasionally yields to the more imperious passion of avarice.
 The prospect of gain will urge a rich and gouty senator as far as Spoleto; every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is subdued by the hopes of an inheritance, or even of a legacy; and a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the Romans.
 The art of obtaining the signature of a favourable testament, and sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution, is perfectly understood; and it has happened that in the same house, though in different apartments, a husband and a wife, with the laudable design of over-reaching each other, have summoned their respective lawyers, to declare at the same time their mutual but contradictory intentions.
 The distress which follows and chastises extravagant luxury often reduces the great to the use of the most humiliating expedients.
 When they desire to borrow, they employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the comedy; but when they are called upon to pay, they assume the royal and tragic declamation of the grandsons of Hercules.
 If the demand is repeated, they readily procure some trusty sycophant, instructed to maintain a charge of poison, or magic, against the insolent creditor, who is seldom released from prison till he has signed a discharge of the whole debt.
 These vices, which degrade the moral character of the Romans, are mixed with a puerile superstition that disgraces their understanding.
 They listen with confidence to the predictions of haruspices, who pretend to read in the entrails of victims the signs of future greatness and prosperity; and there are many who do not presume either to bathe or to dine, or to appear in public, till they have diligently consulted, according to the rules of astrology, the situation of <LOC>Mercury</LOC> and the aspect of the moon.
 (49) It is singular enough that this vain credulity may often be discovered among the profane sceptics who impiously doubt or deny the existence of a celestial power.
" State and character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people In populous cities, which are the seat of commerce and manufactures, the middle ranks of inhabitants, who derive their subsistence from the dexterity or labour of their hands, are commonly the most prolific, the most useful, and; in that sense, the most respectable part of the community.
 But the plebeians of Rome, who disdained such sedentary and servile arts, had been oppressed from the earliest times by the weight of debt and usury, and the husbandman, during the term of his military service, was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm.
 (50) The lands of Italy, which had been originally divided among the families of free and indigent proprietors, were insensibly purchased or usurped by the avarice of the nobles; and in the age which preceded the fall of the republic, it was computed that only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> citizens were possessed of any independent substance.
(51) Yet as long as the people bestowed by their suffrages the honours of the state, the command of the legions, and the administration of wealthy provinces, their conscious pride alleviated in some measure the hardships of poverty and their wants were seasonably supplied by the ambitious liberality of the candidates, who aspired to secure a venal majority in the <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> tribes, or the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and ninety-three centuries, of Rome.
 But when the prodigal commons had imprudently alienated not only the use, but the inheritance, of power, they sunk, under the reign of the Caesars, into a vile and wretched populace, which must, in a few generations, have been totally extinguished, if it had not been continually recruited by the manumission of slaves and the influx of strangers.
 As early as the time of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> it was the just complaint of the ingenuous natives that the capital had attracted the vices of the universe and the manners of the most opposite nations.
 The intemperance of the Gauls, the cunning and levity of the Greeks, the savage obstinacy of the <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> and Jews, the servile temper of the Asiatics, and the dissolute, effeminate prostitution of the Syrians, were mingled in the various multitude, which, under the proud and false denomination of Romans, presumed to despise their fellow-subjects, and even their sovereigns, who dwelt beyond the precincts of the ETERNAL CITY.
(52) Public distribution of bread, bacon, oil, wine, etc Yet the name of that city was still pronounced with respect: the frequent and capricious tumults of its inhabitants were indulged with impunity; and the successors of Constantine, instead of crushing the last remains of the democracy by the strong arm of military power, embraced the mild policy of Augustus, and studied to relieve the poverty and to amuse the idleness of an innumerable people.
 (53)I.
 For the convenience of the lazy plebeians, the monthly distributions of corn were converted into a <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of bread; a great number of ovens were constructed and maintained at the public expense; and at the appointed hour, each citizen, who was furnished with a ticket, ascended the flight of steps which had been assigned to his peculiar <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> or division, and received, either as a gift or at a very low price, a loaf of bread of the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds for the use of his family.
 II.
The forests of Lucania, whose acorns fattened large droves of wild hogs, (54) afforded, as a species of tribute, a plentiful supply of cheap and wholesome meat.
 During <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months of the year a regular allowance of bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens; and the annual consumption of the capital, at a time when it was much declined from its former lustre, was ascertained, by an edict of Valentinian the Third, at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds.
 (55) III.
In the manners of antiquity the use of oil was indispensable for the lamp as well as for the bath, and the annual tax which was imposed on <LOC>Africa</LOC> for the benefit of <GPE>Rome</GPE> amounted to the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions of pounds, to the measure, perhaps, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> English gallons.
 IV.
 The anxiety of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to provide the metropolis with sufficient plenty of corn was not extended beyond that necessary article of human subsistence; and when the popular clamour accused the dearness and scarcity of wine, a proclamation was issued by the grave reformer to remind his subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst, since the aqueducts of <PERSON>Agrippa</PERSON> had introduced into the city so many copious streams of pure and salubrious water.
(56) This rigid sobriety was insensibly relaxed; and, although the generous design of Aurelian(57) does not appear to have been executed in its full extent, the use of wine was allowed on very easy and liberal terms.
 The administration of the public cellars was delegated to a magistrate of honourable rank; and a considerable part of the vintage of <GPE>Campania</GPE> was reserved for the fortunate inhabitants of Rome.
 Use of the public baths.
 The stupendous aqueducts, so justly celebrated by the praises of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> himself, replenished the Thermae, or baths, which had been constructed in every part of the city with <NORP>Imperial</NORP> magnificence.
 The baths of Antoninus Caracalla, which were open, at stated hours, for the indiscriminate service of the senators and the people, contained above sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> seats of marble; and more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> were reckoned in the baths of Diocletian.
 (58) The walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious mosaics, that imitated the art of the pencil in the elegance of design and the variety of colours.
 The <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> granite was beautifully encrusted with the precious green marble of Numidia; the perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the capacious basins through so many wide mouths of bright and massy silver; and the meanest <NORP>Roman</NORP> could purchase, with a small copper coin, the <DATE>daily</DATE> enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury which might excite the envy of the kings of Asia.
(59) From these stately palaces issued a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians, without shoes and without a mantle; who loitered away whole days in the street or <ORG>Forum</ORG> to hear news and to hold disputes who dissipated in extravagant gaming the miserable pittance of their wives and children; and spent the <TIME>hours</TIME> of the night in obscure taverns and brothels in the indulgence of gross and vulgar sensuality.
(60) Games and spectacles But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles.
 The piety of <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people still considered the <FAC>Circus</FAC> as their home, their temple, and the seat of the republic.
 The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secure their places, and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos.
 From the morning to the evening, careless of the sun or of the rain, the spectators, who sometimes amounted to the number of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand, remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the colours which they espoused; and the happiness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> appeared to hang on the event of a race.
 (61) The same immoderate ardour inspired their clamours and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation.
 These representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste, and perhaps of virtue.
 But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans, who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius,(62) had been almost totally silent since the fall of the republic; (63) and their place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and splendid pageantry.
 The pantomimes, (64) who maintained their reputation from the age of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century, expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people.
 The vast and magnificent theatres of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were filled by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> female dancers, and by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> singers, with the masters of the respective choruses.
 Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed, that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts.
(65) Populous of <GPE>Rome</GPE> It is said that the foolish curiosity of <GPE>Elagabalus</GPE> attempted to discover, from the quantity of spiders' webs, the number of the inhabitants of Rome.
 A more rational method of inquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who could easily have resolved a question so important for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government and so interesting to succeeding ages.
 The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the common average, we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which should destroy the extravagant assertions of critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers.
(66) The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances, which, slight and imperfect as they are, may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome.
 I.
 When the capital of the empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal to twenty-one miles.
(67) It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle, the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference.
 II.
 The architect Vitruvius, who flourished in the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, observes that the innumerable habitations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air.
 (68) But the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the walls of <GPE>Rome</GPE> should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground.
(69) III.
 <PERSON>Juvenal</PERSON> (70) laments, as it should seem from his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay, from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase in the little towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> a cheerful, commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
 House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces and gardens; but the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was crowded into a narrow space; and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided, as it is still the custom of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and other cities, among several families of plebeians.
 IV.
 The total number of houses in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of <GPE>Rome</GPE> composed under the reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-two.
(71) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes of domus and of insulae, into which they are divided, include all the habitations of the capital, of every rank and condition, from the marble palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodginghouse where the poet <PERSON>Codrus</PERSON> and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the tiles.
 If we adopt the same average which, under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris,(72) and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand: a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe.
(73) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> seige of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408.
 Such was the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> under the reign of Honorius, at the time when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
 (74) By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an assault, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> encompassed the walls, commanded the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tiber, from which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world; but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim.
 Perhaps in the person of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor; they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 Actuated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city.
 That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine.
 Famine.
 The <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion.
 The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband.
(75) But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves.
 The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain.
 The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger.
 A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers (such was the horrid conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast), even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants!(76)Plague.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy, the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease.
 The assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported, for some time, the fainting resolution of the Romans, Superstition.
 till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a preternatural deliverance.
 Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or fanaticism of some <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> diviners, that, by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians.
(77) The important secret was communicated to Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St.
 Peter is accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates; the majority of that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> displeasure, refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism.
(78) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, "If such, O king! are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?" "YOUR LIVES," replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles, by <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> MarcellinusState and character of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people In populous cities, which are the seat of commerce and manufactures, the middle ranks of inhabitants, who derive their subsistence from the dexterity or labour of their hands, are commonly the most prolific, the most useful, and; in that sense, the most respectable part of the community.
 But the plebeians of Rome, who disdained such sedentary and servile arts, had been oppressed from the earliest times by the weight of debt and usury, and the husbandman, during the term of his military service, was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm.
 (50) The lands of Italy, which had been originally divided among the families of free and indigent proprietors, were insensibly purchased or usurped by the avarice of the nobles; and in the age which preceded the fall of the republic, it was computed that only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> citizens were possessed of any independent substance.
(51) Yet as long as the people bestowed by their suffrages the honours of the state, the command of the legions, and the administration of wealthy provinces, their conscious pride alleviated in some measure the hardships of poverty and their wants were seasonably supplied by the ambitious liberality of the candidates, who aspired to secure a venal majority in the <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> tribes, or the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and ninety-three centuries, of Rome.
 But when the prodigal commons had imprudently alienated not only the use, but the inheritance, of power, they sunk, under the reign of the Caesars, into a vile and wretched populace, which must, in a few generations, have been totally extinguished, if it had not been continually recruited by the manumission of slaves and the influx of strangers.
 As early as the time of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> it was the just complaint of the ingenuous natives that the capital had attracted the vices of the universe and the manners of the most opposite nations.
 The intemperance of the Gauls, the cunning and levity of the Greeks, the savage obstinacy of the <NORP>Egyptians</NORP> and Jews, the servile temper of the Asiatics, and the dissolute, effeminate prostitution of the Syrians, were mingled in the various multitude, which, under the proud and false denomination of Romans, presumed to despise their fellow-subjects, and even their sovereigns, who dwelt beyond the precincts of the ETERNAL CITY.
(52) Public distribution of bread, bacon, oil, wine, etc Yet the name of that city was still pronounced with respect: the frequent and capricious tumults of its inhabitants were indulged with impunity; and the successors of Constantine, instead of crushing the last remains of the democracy by the strong arm of military power, embraced the mild policy of Augustus, and studied to relieve the poverty and to amuse the idleness of an innumerable people.
 (53)I.
 For the convenience of the lazy plebeians, the monthly distributions of corn were converted into a <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of bread; a great number of ovens were constructed and maintained at the public expense; and at the appointed hour, each citizen, who was furnished with a ticket, ascended the flight of steps which had been assigned to his peculiar <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> or division, and received, either as a gift or at a very low price, a loaf of bread of the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds for the use of his family.
 II.
The forests of Lucania, whose acorns fattened large droves of wild hogs, (54) afforded, as a species of tribute, a plentiful supply of cheap and wholesome meat.
 During <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months of the year a regular allowance of bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens; and the annual consumption of the capital, at a time when it was much declined from its former lustre, was ascertained, by an edict of Valentinian the Third, at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds.
 (55) III.
In the manners of antiquity the use of oil was indispensable for the lamp as well as for the bath, and the annual tax which was imposed on <LOC>Africa</LOC> for the benefit of <GPE>Rome</GPE> amounted to the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions of pounds, to the measure, perhaps, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> English gallons.
 IV.
 The anxiety of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to provide the metropolis with sufficient plenty of corn was not extended beyond that necessary article of human subsistence; and when the popular clamour accused the dearness and scarcity of wine, a proclamation was issued by the grave reformer to remind his subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst, since the aqueducts of <PERSON>Agrippa</PERSON> had introduced into the city so many copious streams of pure and salubrious water.
(56) This rigid sobriety was insensibly relaxed; and, although the generous design of Aurelian(57) does not appear to have been executed in its full extent, the use of wine was allowed on very easy and liberal terms.
 The administration of the public cellars was delegated to a magistrate of honourable rank; and a considerable part of the vintage of <GPE>Campania</GPE> was reserved for the fortunate inhabitants of Rome.
 Use of the public baths.
 The stupendous aqueducts, so justly celebrated by the praises of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> himself, replenished the Thermae, or baths, which had been constructed in every part of the city with <NORP>Imperial</NORP> magnificence.
 The baths of Antoninus Caracalla, which were open, at stated hours, for the indiscriminate service of the senators and the people, contained above sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> seats of marble; and more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> were reckoned in the baths of Diocletian.
 (58) The walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious mosaics, that imitated the art of the pencil in the elegance of design and the variety of colours.
 The <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> granite was beautifully encrusted with the precious green marble of Numidia; the perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the capacious basins through so many wide mouths of bright and massy silver; and the meanest <NORP>Roman</NORP> could purchase, with a small copper coin, the <DATE>daily</DATE> enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury which might excite the envy of the kings of Asia.
(59) From these stately palaces issued a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians, without shoes and without a mantle; who loitered away whole days in the street or <ORG>Forum</ORG> to hear news and to hold disputes who dissipated in extravagant gaming the miserable pittance of their wives and children; and spent the <TIME>hours</TIME> of the night in obscure taverns and brothels in the indulgence of gross and vulgar sensuality.
(60) Games and spectacles But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles.
 The piety of <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people still considered the <FAC>Circus</FAC> as their home, their temple, and the seat of the republic.
 The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secure their places, and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos.
 From the morning to the evening, careless of the sun or of the rain, the spectators, who sometimes amounted to the number of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand, remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the colours which they espoused; and the happiness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> appeared to hang on the event of a race.
 (61) The same immoderate ardour inspired their clamours and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation.
 These representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste, and perhaps of virtue.
 But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans, who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius,(62) had been almost totally silent since the fall of the republic; (63) and their place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and splendid pageantry.
 The pantomimes, (64) who maintained their reputation from the age of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century, expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people.
 The vast and magnificent theatres of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were filled by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> female dancers, and by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> singers, with the masters of the respective choruses.
 Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed, that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts.
(65) Populous of <GPE>Rome</GPE> It is said that the foolish curiosity of <GPE>Elagabalus</GPE> attempted to discover, from the quantity of spiders' webs, the number of the inhabitants of Rome.
 A more rational method of inquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who could easily have resolved a question so important for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government and so interesting to succeeding ages.
 The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the common average, we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which should destroy the extravagant assertions of critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers.
(66) The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances, which, slight and imperfect as they are, may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome.
 I.
 When the capital of the empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal to twenty-one miles.
(67) It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle, the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference.
 II.
 The architect Vitruvius, who flourished in the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, observes that the innumerable habitations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air.
 (68) But the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the walls of <GPE>Rome</GPE> should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground.
(69) III.
 <PERSON>Juvenal</PERSON> (70) laments, as it should seem from his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay, from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase in the little towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> a cheerful, commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
 House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces and gardens; but the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was crowded into a narrow space; and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided, as it is still the custom of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and other cities, among several families of plebeians.
 IV.
 The total number of houses in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of <GPE>Rome</GPE> composed under the reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-two.
(71) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes of domus and of insulae, into which they are divided, include all the habitations of the capital, of every rank and condition, from the marble palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodginghouse where the poet <PERSON>Codrus</PERSON> and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the tiles.
 If we adopt the same average which, under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris,(72) and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand: a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe.
(73) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> seige of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408.
 Such was the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> under the reign of Honorius, at the time when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
 (74) By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an assault, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> encompassed the walls, commanded the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tiber, from which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world; but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim.
 Perhaps in the person of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor; they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 Actuated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city.
 That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine.
 Famine.
 The <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion.
 The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband.
(75) But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves.
 The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain.
 The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger.
 A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers (such was the horrid conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast), even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants!(76)Plague.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy, the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease.
 The assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported, for some time, the fainting resolution of the Romans, Superstition.
 till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a preternatural deliverance.
 Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or fanaticism of some <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> diviners, that, by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians.
(77) The important secret was communicated to Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St.
 Peter is accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates; the majority of that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> displeasure, refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism.
(78) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, "If such, O king! are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?" "YOUR LIVES," replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.

 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Public distribution of bread, bacon, oil, wine, etc Yet the name of that city was still pronounced with respect: the frequent and capricious tumults of its inhabitants were indulged with impunity; and the successors of Constantine, instead of crushing the last remains of the democracy by the strong arm of military power, embraced the mild policy of Augustus, and studied to relieve the poverty and to amuse the idleness of an innumerable people.
 (53)I.
 For the convenience of the lazy plebeians, the monthly distributions of corn were converted into a <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of bread; a great number of ovens were constructed and maintained at the public expense; and at the appointed hour, each citizen, who was furnished with a ticket, ascended the flight of steps which had been assigned to his peculiar <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> or division, and received, either as a gift or at a very low price, a loaf of bread of the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds for the use of his family.
 II.
The forests of Lucania, whose acorns fattened large droves of wild hogs, (54) afforded, as a species of tribute, a plentiful supply of cheap and wholesome meat.
 During <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months of the year a regular allowance of bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens; and the annual consumption of the capital, at a time when it was much declined from its former lustre, was ascertained, by an edict of Valentinian the Third, at <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds.
 (55) III.
In the manners of antiquity the use of oil was indispensable for the lamp as well as for the bath, and the annual tax which was imposed on <LOC>Africa</LOC> for the benefit of <GPE>Rome</GPE> amounted to the weight of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> millions of pounds, to the measure, perhaps, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> English gallons.
 IV.
 The anxiety of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to provide the metropolis with sufficient plenty of corn was not extended beyond that necessary article of human subsistence; and when the popular clamour accused the dearness and scarcity of wine, a proclamation was issued by the grave reformer to remind his subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst, since the aqueducts of <PERSON>Agrippa</PERSON> had introduced into the city so many copious streams of pure and salubrious water.
(56) This rigid sobriety was insensibly relaxed; and, although the generous design of Aurelian(57) does not appear to have been executed in its full extent, the use of wine was allowed on very easy and liberal terms.
 The administration of the public cellars was delegated to a magistrate of honourable rank; and a considerable part of the vintage of <GPE>Campania</GPE> was reserved for the fortunate inhabitants of Rome.
 Use of the public baths.
 The stupendous aqueducts, so justly celebrated by the praises of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> himself, replenished the Thermae, or baths, which had been constructed in every part of the city with <NORP>Imperial</NORP> magnificence.
 The baths of Antoninus Caracalla, which were open, at stated hours, for the indiscriminate service of the senators and the people, contained above sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> seats of marble; and more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> were reckoned in the baths of Diocletian.
 (58) The walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious mosaics, that imitated the art of the pencil in the elegance of design and the variety of colours.
 The <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> granite was beautifully encrusted with the precious green marble of Numidia; the perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the capacious basins through so many wide mouths of bright and massy silver; and the meanest <NORP>Roman</NORP> could purchase, with a small copper coin, the <DATE>daily</DATE> enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury which might excite the envy of the kings of Asia.
(59) From these stately palaces issued a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians, without shoes and without a mantle; who loitered away whole days in the street or <ORG>Forum</ORG> to hear news and to hold disputes who dissipated in extravagant gaming the miserable pittance of their wives and children; and spent the <TIME>hours</TIME> of the night in obscure taverns and brothels in the indulgence of gross and vulgar sensuality.
(60) Games and spectacles But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles.
 The piety of <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people still considered the <FAC>Circus</FAC> as their home, their temple, and the seat of the republic.
 The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secure their places, and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos.
 From the morning to the evening, careless of the sun or of the rain, the spectators, who sometimes amounted to the number of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand, remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the colours which they espoused; and the happiness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> appeared to hang on the event of a race.
 (61) The same immoderate ardour inspired their clamours and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation.
 These representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste, and perhaps of virtue.
 But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans, who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius,(62) had been almost totally silent since the fall of the republic; (63) and their place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and splendid pageantry.
 The pantomimes, (64) who maintained their reputation from the age of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century, expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people.
 The vast and magnificent theatres of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were filled by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> female dancers, and by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> singers, with the masters of the respective choruses.
 Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed, that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts.
(65) Populous of <GPE>Rome</GPE> It is said that the foolish curiosity of <GPE>Elagabalus</GPE> attempted to discover, from the quantity of spiders' webs, the number of the inhabitants of Rome.
 A more rational method of inquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who could easily have resolved a question so important for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government and so interesting to succeeding ages.
 The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the common average, we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which should destroy the extravagant assertions of critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers.
(66) The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances, which, slight and imperfect as they are, may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome.
 I.
 When the capital of the empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal to twenty-one miles.
(67) It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle, the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference.
 II.
 The architect Vitruvius, who flourished in the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, observes that the innumerable habitations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air.
 (68) But the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the walls of <GPE>Rome</GPE> should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground.
(69) III.
 <PERSON>Juvenal</PERSON> (70) laments, as it should seem from his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay, from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase in the little towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> a cheerful, commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
 House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces and gardens; but the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was crowded into a narrow space; and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided, as it is still the custom of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and other cities, among several families of plebeians.
 IV.
 The total number of houses in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of <GPE>Rome</GPE> composed under the reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-two.
(71) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes of domus and of insulae, into which they are divided, include all the habitations of the capital, of every rank and condition, from the marble palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodginghouse where the poet <PERSON>Codrus</PERSON> and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the tiles.
 If we adopt the same average which, under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris,(72) and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand: a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe.
(73) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> seige of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408.
 Such was the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> under the reign of Honorius, at the time when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
 (74) By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an assault, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> encompassed the walls, commanded the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tiber, from which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world; but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim.
 Perhaps in the person of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor; they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 Actuated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city.
 That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine.
 Famine.
 The <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion.
 The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband.
(75) But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves.
 The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain.
 The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger.
 A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers (such was the horrid conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast), even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants!(76)Plague.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy, the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease.
 The assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported, for some time, the fainting resolution of the Romans, Superstition.
 till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a preternatural deliverance.
 Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or fanaticism of some <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> diviners, that, by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians.
(77) The important secret was communicated to Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St.
 Peter is accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates; the majority of that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> displeasure, refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism.
(78) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, "If such, O king! are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?" "YOUR LIVES," replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Use of the public baths.
 The stupendous aqueducts, so justly celebrated by the praises of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> himself, replenished the Thermae, or baths, which had been constructed in every part of the city with <NORP>Imperial</NORP> magnificence.
 The baths of Antoninus Caracalla, which were open, at stated hours, for the indiscriminate service of the senators and the people, contained above sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> seats of marble; and more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> were reckoned in the baths of Diocletian.
 (58) The walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious mosaics, that imitated the art of the pencil in the elegance of design and the variety of colours.
 The <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> granite was beautifully encrusted with the precious green marble of Numidia; the perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the capacious basins through so many wide mouths of bright and massy silver; and the meanest <NORP>Roman</NORP> could purchase, with a small copper coin, the <DATE>daily</DATE> enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury which might excite the envy of the kings of Asia.
(59) From these stately palaces issued a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians, without shoes and without a mantle; who loitered away whole days in the street or <ORG>Forum</ORG> to hear news and to hold disputes who dissipated in extravagant gaming the miserable pittance of their wives and children; and spent the <TIME>hours</TIME> of the night in obscure taverns and brothels in the indulgence of gross and vulgar sensuality.
(60) Games and spectacles But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles.
 The piety of <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people still considered the <FAC>Circus</FAC> as their home, their temple, and the seat of the republic.
 The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secure their places, and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos.
 From the morning to the evening, careless of the sun or of the rain, the spectators, who sometimes amounted to the number of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand, remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the colours which they espoused; and the happiness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> appeared to hang on the event of a race.
 (61) The same immoderate ardour inspired their clamours and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation.
 These representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste, and perhaps of virtue.
 But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans, who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius,(62) had been almost totally silent since the fall of the republic; (63) and their place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and splendid pageantry.
 The pantomimes, (64) who maintained their reputation from the age of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century, expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people.
 The vast and magnificent theatres of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were filled by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> female dancers, and by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> singers, with the masters of the respective choruses.
 Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed, that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts.
(65) Populous of <GPE>Rome</GPE> It is said that the foolish curiosity of <GPE>Elagabalus</GPE> attempted to discover, from the quantity of spiders' webs, the number of the inhabitants of Rome.
 A more rational method of inquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who could easily have resolved a question so important for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government and so interesting to succeeding ages.
 The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the common average, we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which should destroy the extravagant assertions of critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers.
(66) The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances, which, slight and imperfect as they are, may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome.
 I.
 When the capital of the empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal to twenty-one miles.
(67) It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle, the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference.
 II.
 The architect Vitruvius, who flourished in the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, observes that the innumerable habitations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air.
 (68) But the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the walls of <GPE>Rome</GPE> should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground.
(69) III.
 <PERSON>Juvenal</PERSON> (70) laments, as it should seem from his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay, from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase in the little towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> a cheerful, commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
 House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces and gardens; but the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was crowded into a narrow space; and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided, as it is still the custom of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and other cities, among several families of plebeians.
 IV.
 The total number of houses in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of <GPE>Rome</GPE> composed under the reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-two.
(71) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes of domus and of insulae, into which they are divided, include all the habitations of the capital, of every rank and condition, from the marble palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodginghouse where the poet <PERSON>Codrus</PERSON> and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the tiles.
 If we adopt the same average which, under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris,(72) and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand: a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe.
(73) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> seige of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408.
 Such was the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> under the reign of Honorius, at the time when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
 (74) By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an assault, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> encompassed the walls, commanded the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tiber, from which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world; but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim.
 Perhaps in the person of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor; they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 Actuated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city.
 That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine.
 Famine.
 The <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion.
 The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband.
(75) But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves.
 The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain.
 The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger.
 A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers (such was the horrid conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast), even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants!(76)Plague.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy, the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease.
 The assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported, for some time, the fainting resolution of the Romans, Superstition.
 till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a preternatural deliverance.
 Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or fanaticism of some <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> diviners, that, by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians.
(77) The important secret was communicated to Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St.
 Peter is accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates; the majority of that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> displeasure, refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism.
(78) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, "If such, O king! are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?" "YOUR LIVES," replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Games and spectacles But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles.
 The piety of <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators; but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people still considered the <FAC>Circus</FAC> as their home, their temple, and the seat of the republic.
 The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secure their places, and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos.
 From the morning to the evening, careless of the sun or of the rain, the spectators, who sometimes amounted to the number of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand, remained in eager attention; their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers, their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the colours which they espoused; and the happiness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> appeared to hang on the event of a race.
 (61) The same immoderate ardour inspired their clamours and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation.
 These representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste, and perhaps of virtue.
 But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans, who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius,(62) had been almost totally silent since the fall of the republic; (63) and their place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce, effeminate music, and splendid pageantry.
 The pantomimes, (64) who maintained their reputation from the age of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century, expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people.
 The vast and magnificent theatres of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were filled by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> female dancers, and by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> singers, with the masters of the respective choruses.
 Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed, that, in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts.
(65) Populous of <GPE>Rome</GPE> It is said that the foolish curiosity of <GPE>Elagabalus</GPE> attempted to discover, from the quantity of spiders' webs, the number of the inhabitants of Rome.
 A more rational method of inquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who could easily have resolved a question so important for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government and so interesting to succeeding ages.
 The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the common average, we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which should destroy the extravagant assertions of critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers.
(66) The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances, which, slight and imperfect as they are, may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome.
 I.
 When the capital of the empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal to twenty-one miles.
(67) It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle, the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference.
 II.
 The architect Vitruvius, who flourished in the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, observes that the innumerable habitations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air.
 (68) But the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the walls of <GPE>Rome</GPE> should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground.
(69) III.
 <PERSON>Juvenal</PERSON> (70) laments, as it should seem from his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay, from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase in the little towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> a cheerful, commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
 House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces and gardens; but the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was crowded into a narrow space; and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided, as it is still the custom of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and other cities, among several families of plebeians.
 IV.
 The total number of houses in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of <GPE>Rome</GPE> composed under the reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-two.
(71) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes of domus and of insulae, into which they are divided, include all the habitations of the capital, of every rank and condition, from the marble palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodginghouse where the poet <PERSON>Codrus</PERSON> and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the tiles.
 If we adopt the same average which, under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris,(72) and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand: a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe.
(73) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> seige of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408.
 Such was the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> under the reign of Honorius, at the time when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
 (74) By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an assault, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> encompassed the walls, commanded the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tiber, from which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world; but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim.
 Perhaps in the person of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor; they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 Actuated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city.
 That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine.
 Famine.
 The <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion.
 The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband.
(75) But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves.
 The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain.
 The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger.
 A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers (such was the horrid conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast), even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants!(76)Plague.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy, the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease.
 The assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported, for some time, the fainting resolution of the Romans, Superstition.
 till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a preternatural deliverance.
 Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or fanaticism of some <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> diviners, that, by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians.
(77) The important secret was communicated to Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St.
 Peter is accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates; the majority of that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> displeasure, refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism.
(78) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, "If such, O king! are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?" "YOUR LIVES," replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Populous of <GPE>Rome</GPE> It is said that the foolish curiosity of <GPE>Elagabalus</GPE> attempted to discover, from the quantity of spiders' webs, the number of the inhabitants of Rome.
 A more rational method of inquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes, who could easily have resolved a question so important for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government and so interesting to succeeding ages.
 The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered; and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount, or the common average, we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which should destroy the extravagant assertions of critics, and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers.
(66) The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances, which, slight and imperfect as they are, may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome.
 I.
 When the capital of the empire was besieged by the Goths, the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius, the mathematician, who found it equal to twenty-one miles.
(67) It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle, the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference.
 II.
 The architect Vitruvius, who flourished in the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age, and whose evidence, on this occasion, has peculiar weight and authority, observes that the innumerable habitations of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city; and that the want of ground, which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas, suggested the common, though inconvenient, practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air.
 (68) But the loftiness of these buildings, which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials, was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents; and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus, as well as by Nero, that the height of private edifices within the walls of <GPE>Rome</GPE> should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground.
(69) III.
 <PERSON>Juvenal</PERSON> (70) laments, as it should seem from his own experience, the hardships of the poorer citizens, to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating, without delay, from the smoke of Rome, since they might purchase in the little towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> a cheerful, commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging.
 House-rent was therefore immoderately dear: the rich acquired, at an enormous expense, the ground, which they covered with palaces and gardens; but the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was crowded into a narrow space; and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided, as it is still the custom of <GPE>Paris</GPE> and other cities, among several families of plebeians.
 IV.
 The total number of houses in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of <GPE>Rome</GPE> composed under the reign of Theodosius, and they amount to forty-eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty-two.
(71) The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> classes of domus and of insulae, into which they are divided, include all the habitations of the capital, of every rank and condition, from the marble palace of the Anicii, with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves, to the lofty and narrow lodginghouse where the poet <PERSON>Codrus</PERSON> and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the tiles.
 If we adopt the same average which, under similar circumstances, has been found applicable to Paris,(72) and indifferently allow about twenty-five persons for each house, of every degree, we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand: a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire, though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe.
(73) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> seige of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408.
 Such was the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> under the reign of Honorius, at the time when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
 (74) By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an assault, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> encompassed the walls, commanded the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tiber, from which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world; but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim.
 Perhaps in the person of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor; they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 Actuated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city.
 That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine.
 Famine.
 The <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion.
 The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband.
(75) But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves.
 The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain.
 The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger.
 A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers (such was the horrid conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast), even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants!(76)Plague.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy, the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease.
 The assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported, for some time, the fainting resolution of the Romans, Superstition.
 till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a preternatural deliverance.
 Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or fanaticism of some <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> diviners, that, by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians.
(77) The important secret was communicated to Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St.
 Peter is accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates; the majority of that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> displeasure, refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism.
(78) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, "If such, O king! are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?" "YOUR LIVES," replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> seige of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408.
 Such was the state of <GPE>Rome</GPE> under the reign of Honorius, at the time when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army formed the siege, or rather the blockade, of the city.
 (74) By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces, who impatiently watched the moment of an assault, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> encompassed the walls, commanded the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> principal gates, intercepted all communication with the adjacent country, and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tiber, from which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation, that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world; but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, instead of being directed against an enemy in arms, was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim.
 Perhaps in the person of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might have respected the niece of Theodosius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor; they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invader.
 Actuated, or overawed, by the same popular frenzy, the senate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> was ignominiously strangled; and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city.
 That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity, and at length the horrid calamities of famine.
 Famine.
 The <DATE>daily</DATE> allowance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion.
 The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life, solicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her residence at Rome, and consecrated, to the use of the indigent, the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband.
(75) But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people; and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves.
 The persons of both sexes, who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury, discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature; and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain.
 The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination, the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution, were eagerly devoured, and fiercely disputed, by the rage of hunger.
 A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow-creatures whom they had secretly murdered; and even mothers (such was the horrid conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast), even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants!(76)Plague.
 Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired in their houses, or in the streets, for want of sustenance; and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy, the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air; and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease.
 The assurances of speedy and effectual relief, which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna, supported, for some time, the fainting resolution of the Romans, Superstition.
 till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a preternatural deliverance.
 Pompeianus, praefect of the city, had been persuaded, by the art or fanaticism of some <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> diviners, that, by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices, they could extract the lightning from the clouds, and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians.
(77) The important secret was communicated to Innocent, the bishop of Rome; and the successor of St.
 Peter is accused, perhaps without foundation, of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 But when the question was agitated in the senate; when it was proposed, as an essential condition, that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol, by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates; the majority of that respectable assembly, apprehensive either of the Divine or of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> displeasure, refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism.
(78) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, "If such, O king! are your demands, what do you intend to leave us?" "YOUR LIVES," replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> accepts a ransom, and raises the seige, A.
D.
 409.
 The last resource of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was in the clemency, or at least in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.
 The senate, who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government, appointed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy.
 This important trust was delegated to Basilius, a senator of <NORP>Spanish</NORP> extraction, and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces; and to John, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tribune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in business, as well as by his former intimacy with the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince.
 When they were introduced into his presence, they declared, perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were resolved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> refused them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might sound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people, exercised in arms and animated by despair.
 "The thicker the hay, the easier it is mowed," was the concise reply of the barbarian; and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh, expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.
 He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome: all the gold and silver in the city, whether it were the property of the state, or of individuals; all the rich and precious moveables; and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians.
 The ministers of the senate presumed to ask, in a modest and suppliant tone, replied the haughty conqueror: they trembled and retired.
 Yet before they retired, a short suspension of arms was granted, which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation.
 The stern features of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> were insensibly relaxed; he abated much of the rigour of his terms; and at length consented to raise the siege, on the immediate payment of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robes of silk, of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of fine scarlet cloth, and of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds weight of pepper.
 (79) But the public treasury was exhausted; the annual rents of the great estates in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war; the gold and gems had been exchanged, during the famine, for the vilest sustenance; the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice; and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city.
 As soon as the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric, they were restored, in some measure, to the enjoyment of peace and plenty.
 Several of the gates were cautiously opened; the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths; the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the suburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit, the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries.
 A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious <NORP>Goths</NORP> who had insulted some <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens on the road to Ostia.
 His army, enriched by the contributions of the capital, slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany, where he proposed to establish his winter-quarters; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard became the refuge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> barbarian slaves, who had broke their chains, and aspired, under the command of their great deliverer, to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude.
 About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Huns, whom Adolphus,(80) the brother of his wife, had conducted, at his pressing invitation, from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and who had cut their way, with some difficulty and loss, through the superior numbers of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops.
 A victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art and discipline of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, was at the head of an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fighting men; and <GPE>Italy</GPE> pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric.
(81) Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Fruitless negotiations for peace, A.
D.
 409.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome, without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct.
 In the midst of his apparent prosperity, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was conscious, perhaps, of some secret weakness, some internal defect; or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> senators, at his earnest request, were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna, to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty; and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity, as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune.
 The barbarian still aspired to the rank of master-general of the armies of the West; he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money; and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia, Noricum, and <PERSON>Venetia</PERSON> for the seat of his new kingdom, which would have commanded the important communication between <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the Danube.
 If these modest terms should be rejected, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands, and even to content himself with the possession of Norieum; an exhausted and impoverished country, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of Germany.
(82) But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy, or interested views, of the minister Olympius.
 Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate, he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort, too numerous for a retinue of honour, and too feeble for an army of defence.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Dalmatians, the flower of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> legions, were ordered to march from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to Rome, through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians.
 These brave legionaries, encompassed and betrayed, fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly; their general, Valens, with an <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, escaped from the field of battle; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors, who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations, was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Yet Alaric, instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility, immediately renewed his proposals of peace, and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent, bishop of the city, was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers.
(83) Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.

 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Change and succession of ministers.
 <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> (84) might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities, but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace.
 The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and the empire to Jovius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect—an unworthy servant, who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration.
 The exile, or escape, of the guilty <PERSON>Olympius</PERSON> reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune: he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life; he again rose to power; he fell a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time into disgrace; his ears were cut off—he expired under the lash—and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho.
 After the removal of Olympius, whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state.
 The brave Gennerid,(85) a soldier of barbarian origin, who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors, had been obliged to lay aside the military belt; and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit, he refused to accept any partial dispensation, and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 The conduct of <PERSON>Gennerid</PERSON> in the important station to which he was promoted or restored, of master-general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic.
 From a life of idleness and want his troop were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence, and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna.
 The valour of Gennerid, formidable to the adjacent barbarians, was the firmest bullwark of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier; and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Huns, who arrived on the confines of Italy, attended by such a convoy of provisions, and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen, as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony.
 But the court and councils of <ORG>Honorious</ORG> still remained a scene of weakness and distraction, of corruption and anarchy.
 Instigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principal eunuchs.
 The generals, under a perfidious promise of safety, were sent on shipboard and privately executed; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at <GPE>Milan</GPE> and Constantinople.
 <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> the eunuch and the barbarian <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards; and the mutual jealousy of the subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction.
 By the insolent order of the count of the domestics, the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor; and the subsequent assassination of Allobich, in the midst of a public procession, is the only circumstance of his life in which <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment.
 Yet before they fell, <PERSON>Eusebius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Allobich</PERSON> had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius, from a selfish, and perhaps a criminal motive, had negotiated with Alaric, in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini.
 During the absence of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support; and a letter, signed with the name of Honorius, was immediately despatched to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money, but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the proud demands of a barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> himself; and the Goth, who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency, expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation.
 The conference of <GPE>Rimini</GPE> was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fashionable opinions of the court.
 By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that, without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace, they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic.
 This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were heard to declare that, if they had only invoked the name of the Deity, they would consult the public safety, and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven: but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself; they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom; and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion.
(86) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 409.
 While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marshes and fortifications of Ravenna, they abandoned Rome, almost without defence, to the resentment of Alaric.
 Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved, or affected, that as he moved with his army along the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to reiterate his offers of peace, and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the barbarians.
(87) These impending calamities were however averted, not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius, but by the prudence or humanity of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, who employed a milder, though not less effectual, method of conquest.
 Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the boldest and most stupendous works of <NORP>Roman</NORP> magnificence.
 (88) The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a <DATE>winter</DATE> navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius.
 The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea, and firmly repelled the fury of the waves, while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the ancient colony of Ostia.
 (89) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city,(90) where the corn of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital.
 As soon as <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal, or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people depended.
 The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate; they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius; and the suffrage of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus, praefect of the city.
 The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master-general of the armies of the West; Adolphus, with the rank of count of the domestics, obtained the custody of the person of Attalus; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance.
(91) <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> is created emperor by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Romans.
 The gates of the city were thrown open, and the new emperor of the Romans, encompassed on every side by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms, was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Trajan.
 After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers, <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> convened an assembly of the senate, before whom, in a formal and florid speech, he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic, and of uniting to the empire the provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the <LOC>East</LOC> which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.
 Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper, whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians.
 But the populace, with their usual levity, applauded the change of masters.
 The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius; and the sectaries, oppressed by his persecuting edicts, expected some degree of countenance, or at least of toleration, from a prince who, in his native country of Ionia, had been educated in the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition, and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> bishop.
(92) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the reign of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> were fair and prosperous.
 An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa; the greatest part of <GPE>Italy</GPE> submitted to the terror of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and though the city of <GPE>Bologna</GPE> made a vigorous and effectual resistance, the people of Milan, dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius, accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 At the head of a formidable army, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna; and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers —of <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, of Valens, master of the cavalry and infantry, of the quaestor Potamius, and of Julian, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp.
 In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor, and to divide the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors.
 Their proposals were rejected with disdain; and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus, who condescended to promise that if <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island.
(93) So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources, that <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Valens, his minister and his general, betrayed their trust, infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor, and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival.
 Astonished by such examples of domestic treason, <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> trembled at the approach of every servant, at the arrival of every messenger.
 He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital, his palace, his bedchamber; and some ships lay ready in the harbour of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew, the emperor of the East.
 He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » He is degraded by Alaric, A.
D.
 410.
 But there is a <GPE>Providence</GPE> (such at least was the opinion of the historian <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> (94) ) that watches over innocence and folly, and the pretensions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed.
 At the moment when his despair, incapable of any wise or manly resolution, meditated a shameful flight, a seasonable reinforcement of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna.
 To these valiant strangers, whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city, and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger.
 The favourable intelligence which was received from <LOC>Africa</LOC> suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs.
 The troops and officers whom <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> had sent into that province were defeated and slain, and the active zeal of <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> maintained his own allegiance and that of his people.
 The faithful count of <LOC>Africa</LOC> transmitted a large sum of money, which fixed the attachment of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine, tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome.
 The failure of the <NORP>African</NORP> expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus, and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey.
 The most imprudent measures were adopted, without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric, and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Goths, betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent.
 The resentment of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius, who had been raised to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper.
 In a large plain near Rimini, and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, the wretched <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple; and those ensigns of royalty were sent by <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius.
 (95) The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments, and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed, but the degraded emperor of the Romans, desirous of life and insensible of disgrace, implored the permission of following the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp in the train of a haughty and capricious barbarian.
(96) <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.

 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> siege and sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 410, August 24.
 The degradation of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace, and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> advanced within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to press the irresolution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ministers, whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune.
 His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain, that Sarus, the personal enemy of Adolphus, and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti, had been received into the palace.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> followers that fearless barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna, surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths, re-entered the city in triumph, and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald, who publicly declared that the guilt of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor.
(97) The crime and folly of the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was expiated a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time by the calamities of Rome.
 The king of the Goths, who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge, appeared in arms under the walls of the capital; and the trembling senate, without any hopes of relief, prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country.
 But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics, who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy.
 At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened, and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpet.
 Eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia.
(98) Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: "These," said she, "are the consecrated vessels belonging to St.
 Peter: if you presume to touch them, the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience.
 For my part, I dare not keep what I am unable to defend.
" The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Respect of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion The proclamation of Alaric, when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city, discovered, however, some regard for the laws of humanity and religion.
 He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour, and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people; but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens, and to respect the churches of the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries.
 Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> <NORP>Goths</NORP> displayed the fervour of a recent conversion; and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related, and perhaps adorned, by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers.
(99) While the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey, the humble dwelling of an aged virgin, who had devoted her life to the service of the altar, was forced open by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the powerful Goths.
 He immediately demanded, though in civil language, all the gold and silver in her possession, and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship.
 The barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition, till he was interrupted by a serious admonition, addressed to him in the following words: The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> captain, struck with reverential awe, despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered, and received a peremptory order from Alaric, that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported, without damage or delay, to the church of the apostle.
 From the extremity, perhaps, of the Quirinal hill to the distant <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Vatican, a numerous detachment of Goths, marching in order of battle through the principal streets, protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver, and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody.
 From all the adjacent houses a crowd of <NORP>Christians</NORP> hastened to join this edifying procession, and a multitude of fugitives, without distinction of age or rank, or even of sect, had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican.
 The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by St.
 Augustin, to justify the ways of <GPE>Providence</GPE> in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> greatness.
 He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ, and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm, in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries.
(100) Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Pillage and fire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> In the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded.
 But the holy precincts of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people: many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, more especially of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who served under the standard of Alaric, were strangers to the name, or at least to the faith, of Christ, and we may suspect, without any breach of charity or candour, that in the hour of savage licence, when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed, the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Christians.
 The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans,(101) and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies, which remained without burial during the general consternation.
 The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury; and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless.
 The private revenge of forty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> slaves was exercised without pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families.
 The matrons and virgins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were exposed to injuries more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity, than death itself; and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages.
(102) A <NORP>Roman</NORP> lady, of singular beauty and orthodox faith, had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth, who, according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen, was attached to the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 Exasperated by her obstinate resistance, he drew his sword, and, with the anger of a lover, slightly wounded her neck.
 The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love, till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts, respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican, and gave <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband.
 Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common.
 The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives; and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated, whether those tender victims, who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained, had lost, by their misfortune, the glorious crown of virginity.
(103) There were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern.
 It cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages; and the want of youth, or beauty, or chastity, protected the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> women from the danger of a rape.
 But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion; since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth.
 In the pillage of <GPE>Rome</GPE> a just preference was given to gold and jewels, which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight, but, after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers, the palaces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture.
 The sideboards of massy plate, and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed: many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase, in the division of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe.
 The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians, who proceeded by threats, by blows, and by tortures, to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure.
(104) Visible splendour and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune; the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition; and the obstinacy of some misers, who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection, was fatal to many unhappy wretches, who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures.
 The edifices of Rome, though the damage has been much exaggerated, received some injury from the violence of the Goths.
 At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens; the flames, which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night, consumed many private and public buildings, and the ruins of the palace of Sallust(105) remained in the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> a stately monument of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> conflagration.
 (106) Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass, and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures.
 Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion, that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage, and that the proud <ORG>Forum</ORG> of Rome, decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes, was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning.
 (107) Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Captives and fugitives Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome, it is confidently affirmed that only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy.
(108) But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who, from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune, were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles.
 As the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves, they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners; and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends, or the charity of strangers.
 (109) The captives, who were regularly sold, either in open market or by private contract, would have legally regained their native freedom, which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate.
(110) But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives, and that the Goths, unless they were tempted to sell, might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners, the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation, that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, till they had discharged by their labour the price of their redemption.
 (111) The nations who invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire had driven before them, into Italy, whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials, less apprehensive of servitude than of famine.
 The calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely, the most secure, the most distant places of refuge.
 While the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea-coast of <GPE>Campania</GPE> and Tuscany, the little island of Igilium, separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory, repulsed, or eluded, their hostile attempts; and at so small a distance from Rome, great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot.
(112) The ample patrimonies which many <NORP>senatorian</NORP> families possessed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> invited them, if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country, to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province.
 The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba,(113) the widow of the praefect Petronius.
 After the death of her husband, the most powerful subject of Rome, she had remained at the head of the <NORP>Anician</NORP> family, and successively supplied, from her private fortune, the expense of the consulships of her <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths, <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> supported with <NORP>Christian</NORP> resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld, at sea, the flames of her burning palace; and fled with her daughter Laeta, and her grand-daughter, the celebrated virgin Demetrias, to the coast of Africa.
 The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity.
 But even the family of <PERSON>Proba</PERSON> herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian, who basely sold, in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the lust or avarice of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> merchants.
 The <NORP>Italian</NORP> fugitives were dispersed through the provinces, along the coast of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia, as far as <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Jerusalem; and the village of Bethlehem, the solitary residence of St.
 <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> and his female converts, was crowned with illustrious beggars, of either sex and every age, who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune.
(114) This awful catastrophe of <GPE>Rome</GPE> filled the astonished empire with grief and terror.
 So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore, and even to exaggerate, the afflictions of the queen of cities.
 The clergy, who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> prophecy, were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe.
 Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by troops of Charles V There exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages, and to magnify the evils, of the present times.
 Yet, when the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions had subsided, and a fair estimate was made of the real damage, the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly received more essential injury from the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> than she had now sustained from the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in her declining age.
 (115) The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel; and to affirm with confidence, that the ravages of the barbarians whom <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had led from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth, a catholic prince, who styled himself Emperor of the Romans.
 (116) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> evacuated the city at the end of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, but <GPE>Rome</GPE> remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists; and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty, lust, and rapine.
 The authority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king; but the constable of <PERSON>Bourbon</PERSON> had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls; and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> independent nations, the Italians, the Spaniards, and the Germans.
 In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of <GPE>Italy</GPE> exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind.
 They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society, with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury; and the loose adventurers, who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians.
 At the same era the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> were the terror both of the Old and New World; but their high-spirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride, rapacious avarice, and unrelenting cruelty.
 Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches, they had improved, by repeated practice, the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners: many of the <NORP>Castilians</NORP> who pillaged <GPE>Rome</GPE> were familiars of the holy inquisition; and some volunteers, perhaps, were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> were less corrupt than the Italians, less cruel than the Spaniards; and the rustic, or even savage aspect of those <NORP>Tramontane</NORP> warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition.
 But they had imbibed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of the Reformation, the spirit, as well as the principles, of Luther.
 It was their favourite amusement to insult, or destroy, the consecrated objects of catholic superstition; they indulged, without pity or remorse, a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of the inhabitants of modern Rome; and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist, to purify, with blood and fire, the abominations of the spiritual Babylon.
 (117) <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> evacuates Rome, and ravages Italy, A.
D.
 410, August 29.
 The retreat of the victorious Goths, who evacuated <GPE>Rome</GPE> on the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> day, (118) might be the result of prudence, but it was not surely the effect of fear.
(119) At the head of an army encumbered with rich and weighty spoils, their intrepid leader advanced along the Appian Way into the southern provinces of Italy, destroying whatever dared to oppose his passage, and contenting himself with the plunder of the unresisting country.
 The fate of Capua, the proud and luxurious metropolis of Campania, and which was respected, even in its decay, as the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> city of the empire,(120) is buried in oblivion; whilst the adjacent town of Nola(121) has been illustrated, on this occasion, by the sanctity of Paulinus,(122) who was successively a consul, a monk, and a bishop.
 At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour, of society and literature, to embrace a life of solitude and penance; and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends, who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body.
(123) An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Nola, near the miraculous tomb of St.
 Felix, which the public devotion had already surrounded with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> large and populous churches.
 The remains of his fortune, and of his understanding, were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr; whose praise, on the day of his festival, <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn; and in whose name he erected a <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> church, of superior elegance and beauty, which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament.
 Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint,(124) or at least of the people; and, after <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years' retirement the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola, a few months before the city was invested by the Goths.
 During the siege, some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen, either in dreams or visions, the divine form of their tutelar patron, yet it soon appeared by the event, that <PERSON>Felix</PERSON> wanted power, or inclination, to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd.
 <PERSON>Nola</PERSON> was not saved from the general devastation;(125) and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty.
Possesion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Goths, A.
D.
 408-412.
 Above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years elapsed from the successful invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the arms of Alaric, to the voluntary retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> under the conduct of his successor Adolphus; and, during the whole time, they reigned without control over a country which, in the opinion of the ancients, had united all the various excellences of nature and art.
 The prosperity, indeed, which <GPE>Italy</GPE> had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines, had gradually declined with the decline of the empire.
 The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the barbarians; and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians.
 Each soldier, however, claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty, the corn and cattle, oil and wine, that was <DATE>daily</DATE> collected and consumed, in the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens, once inhabited by <PERSON>Lucullus</PERSON> and Cicero, along the beauteous coast of Campania.
 Their trembling captives, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators, presented, in goblets of gold and gems, large draughts of <NORP>Falernian</NORP> wine to the haughty victors, who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane-trees, (126) artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays, and to admit the genial warmth, of the sun.
 These delights were enhanced by the memory of past hardships: the comparison of their native soil, the bleak and barren hills of Scythia, and the frozen banks of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Danube, added new charms to the felicity of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> climate.
(127) Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.

 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Death of Alaric, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>410</CARDINAL> Whether fame, or conquest, or riches were the object of Alaric, he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardour which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success.
 No sooner had he reached the extreme land of <GPE>Italy</GPE> than he was attracted by the neighbouring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island.
 Yet even the possession of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> he considered only an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa.
 The straits of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Messina(128) are <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles in length, and in the narrowest passage about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile and a half broad; and the fabulous monsters of the deep, the rocks of <LOC>Scylla</LOC> and the whirlpool of Charybdis, could terrify none but the most timid and unskilled mariners.
 Yet as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> division of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had embarked, a sudden tempest arose, which sunk or scattered many of the transports; their courage was daunted by the terrors of a new element; and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric, which fixed, after a short illness, the fatal term of his conquests.
 The ferocious character of the barbarians was displayed in the funeral of a hero whose valour and fortune they celebrated with mournful applause.
 By the labour of a captive multitude they forcibly diverted the course of the Busentinus, a small river that washes the walls of Consentia.
 The royal sepulchre, adorned with the splendid spoils and trophies of Rome, was constructed in the vacant bed; the waters were then restored to their natural channel; and the secret spot where the remains of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had been deposited was for ever concealed by the inhuman massacre of the prisoners who had been employed to execute the work.
(129) Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 "In the full confidence of valour and victory, I once aspired (said Adolphus) to change the face of the universe; to obliterate the name of Rome; to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths; and to acquire, like Augustus, the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire.
 By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state; and that the fierce untractable humour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government.
 From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition; and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger, who employed the sword of the Goths, not to subvert, but to restore and maintain, the prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
" (130) With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Adolphus, king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> concludes a peace with the empire, and marches into Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>412</CARDINAL> The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs; and the brave Adolphus, the brother-in-law of the deceased monarchy was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne.
 The character and political system of the new king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne, who afterwards, in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, related it to St Jerom, in the presence of the historian Orosius.
 With these pacific views the successor of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> suspended the operations of war, and seriously negotiated with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court a treaty of friendship and alliance.
 It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius, who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath, to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the intolerable weight of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers; and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (131) Adolphus, assuming the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> General, directed his march from the extremity of <GPE>Campania</GPE> to the southern provinces of Gaul.
 His troops, either by force or agreement, immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux; and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles, they soon extended their quarters from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the ocean.
 The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies; yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths.
 The cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius: the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus; and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed, with an appearance of truth, to the ungovernable spirit of a barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline.
 The luxury of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths; and they had imbibed the vices, without imitating the arts and institutions, of civilised society.
(132) His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » His marriage with Placidia, A.
D.
 414 The professions of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> were probably sincere, and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the barbarian king.
 Placidia,(133) the daughter of the great Theodosius, and of Galla, his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife, had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople; but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire under the reign of her brother Honorius.
 When <GPE>Rome</GPE> was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invested by the arms of Alaric, Placidia, who was then about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of age, resided in the city; and her ready consent of the death of her cousin <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> has a cruel and ungrateful appearance, which, according to the circumstances of the action, may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age.
 (134) The victorious barbarians detained, either as a hostage or a captive,(135) the sister of Honorius; but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round <GPE>Italy</GPE> the motions of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp, she experienced, however, a decent and respectful treatment.
 The authority of Jornandes, who praises the beauty of Placidia, may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence, the expressive silence, of her flatterers: yet the splendour of her birth, the bloom of youth, the elegance of manners, and the dexterous insinuations which she condescended to employ, made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of <NORP>Roman</NORP> pride; and repeatedly urged the restitution of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace.
 But the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror, a young and valiant prince, who yielded to <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> in loftiness of stature, but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty.
 The marriage of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> (136) was consummated before the <NORP>Goths</NORP> retired from Italy; and the solemn, perhaps the anniversary, day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious citizens of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> in Gaul.
 The bride, attired and adorned like a <NORP>Roman</NORP> empress, was placed on a throne of state; and the king of the Goths, who assumed on this occasion the <NORP>Roman</NORP> habit, contented himself with a less honourable seat by her side.
 The nuptial gift, which, according to the custom of his nation,(137) was offered to Placidia, consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, in silken robes, carried a basin in each hand; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these basins was filled with pieces of gold, the other with precious stones of an inestimable value.
 Attalus, so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths, was appointed to lead the chorus of the <NORP>Hymeneal</NORP> song; and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician.
 The barbarians enjoyed the insolence of their triumph; and the provincials rejoiced in this alliance, which tempered, by the mild influence of love and reason, the fierce spirit of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> lord.
(138) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures The <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> basins of gold and gems presented to <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures; of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus.
 Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold, enriched with jewels, were found in their palace of <GPE>Narbonne</GPE> when it was pillaged in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> century by the Franks: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cups or chalices; <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> patens, or plates, for the use of the communion; <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> boxes, or cases, to hold the books of the gospels: this consecrated wealth(139) was distributed by the son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> among the churches of his dominions, and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths.
 They possessed, with more security of conscience, the famous missorium, or great dish for the service of the table, of massy gold, of the weight of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, and of far superior value, from the precious stones, the exquisite workmanship, and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius, the patrician, to Torismond, king of the Goths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the successors of <ORG>Torismond</ORG> purchased the aid of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift.
 When he was seated on the throne of Spain, he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert; despoiled them on the road; stipulated, after a long negotiation, the inadequate ransom of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and preserved the missorium as the pride of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasury.
 (140) When that treasury, after the conquest of Spain, was plundered by the Arabs, they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable; a table of considerable size, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> single piece of solid emerald, (141) encircled with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rows of fine pearls, supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty-five feet of gems and massy gold, and estimated at the price of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 (142) Some portion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures .
might be the gift of friendship or the tribute of obedience; but the far greater part had been the fruits of war and rapine, the spoils of the empire, and perhaps of Rome.
 Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Laws for the relief of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome, A.
D.
 410-417 After the deliverance of <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the oppression of the Goths, some secret counsellor was permitted, amidst the factions of the palace, to heal the wounds of that afflicted country.
(143) By a wise and humane regulation the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> provinces which had been the most deeply injured—Campania, Tuscany, Picenum, Samnium, Apulia, Calabria, Bruttium, and Lucania—obtained an indulgence of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years; the ordinary tribute was reduced to one-fifth, and even that <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts.
 By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted, with some diminution of taxes, to the neighbours who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them; and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors.
 About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius, to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity.
 A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital; the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire; and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa.
 The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus, praefect of Rome, informed the court, with some anxiety and surprise, that in a single day he had taken an account of the arrival of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers.
(144) In less than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years the vestiges of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> invasion were almost obliterated, and the city appeared to resume its former splendour and tranquillity.
 The venerable matron replaced her crown of laurel, which had been ruffled by the storms of war, and was still amused in the last moment of her decay with the prophecies of revenge, of victory, and of eternal dominion.
(145) Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Revolt and defeat of Heraclian, count of Africa, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>413</CARDINAL> This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of an hostile armament from the country which afforded the <DATE>daily</DATE> subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Heraclian, count, of Africa, who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius, was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor.
 The ports of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were immediately filled with the naval forces, at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy; and his fleet, when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tiber, indeed surpassed the fleets of <PERSON>Xerxes</PERSON> and Alexander, if all the vessels, including the royal galley and the smallest boat, did actually amount to the incredible number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred.
(146) Yet with such an armament, which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth, the <NORP>African</NORP> usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival.
 As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome, he was encountered, terrified, and routed by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> captains; and the lord of this mighty host, deserting his fortune and his friends, ignominiously fled with a single ship.
(147) When <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> landed in the harbour of Carthage, he found that the whole province, disdaining such an unworthy ruler, had returned to their allegiance.
 The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory, his consulship was abolished,(148) and the remains of his private fortune, not exceeding the moderate sum of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds of gold, were granted to the brave Constantius, who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> viewed with supine indifference the calamities of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, (149) but the rebellious attempts of <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heraclian</PERSON> against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature.
 He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers; and as <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies, he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna, while the tyrants beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius.
 (150) In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince, and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> about thirteen years.
 Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Revolutions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, A.
D.
 409-413 The usurpation of Constantine, who received the purple from the legions of Britain, had been successful, and seemed to be secure.
 His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus , to the Columns of Hercules, and, in the midst of the public disorder, he shared the dominion and the plunder of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> or Pyrenees.
 Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius, he extorted from the court of Ravenna, with which he secretly corresponded, the ratification of his rebellious claims.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, advanced as far as the banks of the Po, and, after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally, hastily returned to the palace of Arles, to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph.
 But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius, the bravest of his generals, who, during the absence of his son Constans, a prince already invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, had been left to command in the provinces of Spain.
 For some reason of which we are ignorant, Gerontius, instead of assuming the diadem, placed it on the head of his friend Maximus, who fixed his residence at Tarragona, while the active count pressed forwards through the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> before they could prepare for their defence.
 The son was made prisoner at Vienne, and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family, which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life.
 The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles; but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 The name of Honorius, the proclamation of a lawful emperor, astonished the contending parties of the rebels.
 Gerontius, abandoned by his own troops, escaped to the confines of Spain, and rescued his name from oblivion by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life.
 In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house, which he had strongly barricaded.
 His wife, a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani, and some faithful slaves, were still attached to his person; and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows, that above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt.
 His slaves, when all the missile weapons were spent, fled at the dawn of day; and Gerontius, if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness, might have imitated their example; till the soldiers, provoked by such obstinate resistance, applied fire on all sides to the house.
 In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head.
 The wife of Gerontius, who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace, eagerly presented her neck to his sword: and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself, who after <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ineffectual strokes, drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart.
 (151) The unprotected Maximus, whom he had invested with the purple, was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities.
 The caprice of the barbarians, who ravaged Spain, once more seated this <NORP>Imperial</NORP> phantom on the throne: but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius; and the tyrant <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> after he had been shown to the people of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> and Rome, was publicly executed.
 Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Character and victories of the general <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> The general, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was his name, who raised by his approach the siege of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and dissipated the troops of Gerontius, was born a Roman; and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire.
 The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general(152) marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended.
 In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging: nor would he sometimes disdain, in the license of convivial mirth, to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession.
 But when the trumpet summoned him to arms; when he mounted his horse, and, bending down (for such was his singular practice) almost upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory.
 He had received from the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West; and the pretended emperor Constantine, after enjoying a short and anxious respite, was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy.
 Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni; and his ambassador, Edobic, soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, instead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wisely, resolved to pass the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and to meet the barbarians.
 His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the front, they were suddenly attacked, surrounded, and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear.
 The remains of the army of <PERSON>Edobic</PERSON> were preserved by flight or submission, and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend, who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> general.
 On this occasion <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman.
 Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy, he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas; but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic, and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality.
 The usurper, who beheld from the walls of <GPE>Arles</GPE> the ruin of his last hopes, was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror.
 He required a solemn promise for his security; and after receiving, by the imposition of hands, the sacred character of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> presbyter, he ventured to open the gates of the city.
 But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity, which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius, were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality.
 Death of the usurper Constantine, A.
D.
 411, November 28.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine; but the abdicated emperor and his son <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> were sent, under a strong guard, into Italy; and before they reached the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> they met the ministers of death.
 Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.
 « NEXT » « Fall In The WEST » « Fall In The EAST » « Decline & Fall » Fall of the usurpers, Jovinus, Sebastian, and Attalus, A.
D.
 411-416 At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne, a rapid succession of usurpers, regardless of the fate of their predecessors, still continued to arise.
 This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Gaul, where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion.
 Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> resigned the purple, and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles, intelligence was received in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp that <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> had assumed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the instigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Rhone.
 Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus.
 It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general, at the head of a victorius army, would have asserted, in a field of battle, the justice of the cause of Honorius.
 The hasty retreat of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> might be justified by weighty reasons; but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul; and Dardanus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper.
(153) When the Goths, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the siege of Rome, established their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch.
 Yet in a moment of disgust (for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date) <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> connected himself with the usurper of Gaul; and imposed on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace.
 We are again surprised to read, that, instead of considering the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> alliance as the firmest support of his throne, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, scorning the advice of his great ally, he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian; and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the soldier of Honorius, was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish.
 Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance, advanced with a body of ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Goths</NORP> to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti.
 He attacked <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> at an unguarded moment, when he was accompanied only by <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of his valiant followers.
 United by friendship, animated by despair, but at length oppressed by multitudes, this band of heroes deserved the esteem, without exciting the compassion, of their enemies; and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils (154) than he was instantly despatched.
 The death of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> dissolved the loose alliance which <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul.
 He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence; and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia, by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> the heads of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> tyrants, <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and Sebastian.
 The king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> executed his promise without difficulty or delay: the helpless brothers, unsupported by any personal merit, were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries; and the short opposition of <PERSON>Valentia</PERSON> was expiated by the ruin of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the oldest cities of Gaul.
 The emperor chosen by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, who had been promoted, degraded, insulted, restored, again degraded, and again insulted, was finally abandoned to his fate; but when the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king withdrew his protection, he was restrained, by pity or contempt, from offering any violence to the person of Attalus.
 The unfortunate Attalus, who was left without subjects or allies, embarked in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ports of Spain, in search of some secure and solitary retreat; but he was intercepted at sea, conducted to the presence of Honorius, led in triumph through the streets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Ravenna, and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> step of the throne of his invincible conqueror.
 The same measure of punishment with which, in the days of his prosperity, he was accused of menacing his rival, was inflicted on <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself: he was condemned, after the amputation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fingers, to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari, where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life.
 The remainder of the reign <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was undisturbed by rebellion; and it may be observed that in the space of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action.
 Invasion of <GPE>Spain</GPE> by the Suevi, Vandals, <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> etc, A.
D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities: as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and the Spaniards, and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country.
 The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow-creatures; and even the wild beasts, who multiplied, without control, in the desert, were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey.
 Pestilence soon appeared, the inseparable companion of famine; a large proportion of the people was swept away; and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends.
 At length the barbarians, satiated with carnage and rapine, and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced, fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country.
 The ancient Gallicia, whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille, was divided between the <PERSON>Suevi</PERSON> and the Vandals: the <PERSON>Alani</PERSON> were scattered over the provinces of <LOC>Carthagena</LOC> and Lusitania, from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean; and the fruitful territory of <GPE>Baetica</GPE> was allotted to the Silingi, another branch of the <LOC>Vandalic</LOC> nation.
 After regulating this partition, the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience: the lands were again cultivated; and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people.
 The greatest part of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom, and who refused, more especially in the mountains of Gallicia, to submit to the barbarian yoke.
" (158) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.
(162) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> conquer and restore Spain, A.
D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.

D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.

D.
 409, <DATE>October</DATE> 13.
 The situation of Spain, separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome, by the sea, by the mountains, and by intermediate provinces, had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country; and we may observe, as a sure symptom of domestic happiness, that, in a period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, <GPE>Spain</GPE> furnished very few materials to the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The footsteps of the barbarians, who, in the reign of Gallienus, had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees, were soon obliterated by the return of peace; and in the fourth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, the cities of <GPE>Emerita</GPE> or Merida, of Corduba, Seville, Bracara, and Tarragona, were numbered with the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 The various plenty of the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms, was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people; and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade.
(155) The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors; and if the character of the <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> was enfeebled by peace and servitude, the hostile approach of the Germans, who had spread terror and desolation from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Pyrenees, seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour.
 As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country, they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post of the <NORP>Honorian</NORP> bands in the service of Constantine, than the gates of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy, about ten months before the sack of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the Goths.
(156) The consciousness of guilt, and the thirst of rapine, prompted the mercenary guards of the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to desert their station; to invite the arms of the Suevi, the Vandals, and the Alani; and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the sea of Africa.
 The misfortunes of <GPE>Spain</GPE> may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian, who has concisely expressed the passionate, and perhaps exaggerated, declamations of contemporary writers.
 (157) Adolphus, king of the Goths, marches into Spain, A.
D.
 414 The important present of the heads of <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> and <GPE>Sebastian</GPE> had approved the friendship of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> and restored <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to the obedience of his brother Honorius.
 Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths.
 He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the barbarians of Spain; the troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul, and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees:(159) he passed the mountains, and surprised, in the name of the emperor, the city of Barcelona.
 The fondness of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> for his <NORP>Roman</NORP> bride was not abated by time or possession; and the birth of a son, surnamed, from his illustrious grandsire, Theodosius, appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the public.
 The loss of that infant, whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the churches near Barcelona, afflicted his parents; but the grief of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king was suspended by the labours of the field; and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason.
 He had imprudently received into his service <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the followers of Sarus, a barbarian of a daring spirit, but of a diminutive stature, whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master.
 His death, A.
D.
 415, August <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona; the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction;(160) and a stranger to the royal race, Singeric, the brother of <PERSON>Sarus</PERSON> himself, was seated on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> children of Adolphus, the issue of a former marriage, whom he tore, without pity, from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop.
 (161) The unfortunate Placidia, instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts, was treated with cruel and wanton insult.
 The daughter of the emperor Theodosius, confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives, was compelled to march on foot above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> miles, before the horse of a barbarian, the assassin of an husband whom <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> loved and lamented.

D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.

 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.
(178) State of Britain, A.
D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.

D.
 415-418.
 But <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> soon obtained the pleasure of revenge; and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant, who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation.
 After the death of Singeric, the free choice of the nation bestowed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sceptre on Wallia, whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared, in the beginning of his reign, extremely hostile to the republic.
 He marched in arms from <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world.
 But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain, (163) and, from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar, contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric.
 The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths; and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks.
 In this disposition, the successor of <PERSON>Adolphus</PERSON> no longer refused to listen to a <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassador, whose proposals were enforced by the real, or supposed, approach of a numerous army, under the conduct of the brave Constantius.
 A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed: <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was honourably restored to her brother; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths;(164) and <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire.
 A bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of Spain; and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters, their ambassadors, and their hostages, to the throne of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest, the events of which must be favourable to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies.
(165) The <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war was obstinately supported, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> campaigns, with desperate valour and various success; and the martial achievements of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> diffused through the empire the superior renown of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> hero.
 He exterminated the Silingi, who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Baetica.
 He slew, in battle, the king of the Alani; and the remains of those <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wanderers who escaped from the field, instead of choosing a new leader, humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals, with whom they were ever afterwards confounded.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> themselves, and the Suevi, yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths.
 The promiscuous multitude of barbarians, whose retreat had been intercepted, were driven into the mountains of Gallicia; where they still continued, in a narrow compass and on a barren soil, to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities.
 In the pride of victory, <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> was faithful to his engagements: he restored his <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquests to the obedience of Honorius; and the tyranny of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude.
 While the event of the war was still doubtful, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advantages obtained by the arms of <PERSON>Wallia</PERSON> had encouraged the court of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign.
 He entered <GPE>Rome</GPE> like the ancient conquerors of nations; and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved, we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators, of magistrates and bishops, applauded the fortune, the wisdom, and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius.
(166) Their establishment in Aquitain, A.
D.
 419 Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome, if Wallia, before he repassed the Pyrenees, had extirpated the seeds of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> war.
 His victorious Goths, forty-three years after they had passed the Danube, were established, according to the faith of treaties, in the possession of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Aquitain, a maritime province between the <LOC>Garonne</LOC> and the Loire, under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux.
 That metropolis, advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean, was built in a regular and elegant form; and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the <NORP>Gauls</NORP> by their wealth, their learning, and the politeness of their manners.
 The adjacent province, which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden, is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate; the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry; and the Goths, after their martial toils, luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain.
 (167) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses; and the successors of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fixed their royal residence at Toulouse, which included <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> populous quarters, or cities, within the spacious circuit of its walls.
 About the same time, in the last years of the reign of Honorius, the GOTHS, the BURGUNDIANS, and the FRANKS, obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul.
 The liberal grant of the usurper <PERSON>Jovinus</PERSON> to his <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor; the lands of the First, or Upper, <GPE>Germany</GPE> were ceded to those formidable barbarians; and they gradually occupied, either by conquest or treaty, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> provinces which still retain, with the titles of <ORG>Duchy</ORG> and of County, the national appellation of Burgundy.
(168) The Franks, the valiant and faithful allies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted.
 Treves, the capital of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was pillaged by their lawless bands; and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria, in Brabant, insensibly multiplied along the banks of the <LOC>Meuse</LOC> and Scheld, till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second, or Lower, Germany.
 These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence; but the foundation of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy by Pharamond, the conquests, the laws, and even the existence of that hero, have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism.
(169) State of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> in Gaul, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.
 The <PERSON>Triumvirs</PERSON> proscribed <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> of the most flourishing colonies of Italy, and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar, and oppressed the liberty of their country.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> poets, of unequal fame, have deplored, in similar circumstances, the loss of their patrimony; but the legionaries of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> appear to have surpassed, in violence and injustice, the barbarians who invaded <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of Honorius.
 It was not without the utmost difficulty that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> escaped from the sword of the centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of Mantua;(170) but <PERSON>Paulinus</PERSON> of <ORG>Bourdeaux</ORG> received a sum of money from his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> purchaser, which he accepted with pleasure and surprise; and, though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate, this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity.
(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.

(171) The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans; and the barbarians of Gaul, more especially the Goths, repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality, and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service.
 The title of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> and his successors, their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul, of which they had resigned the possession to the barbarian allies; and the kings, who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects, ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of master-generals of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> armies.
 (172) Such was the involuntary reverence which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol.
 Revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and Armorica, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>409</CARDINAL> Whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> was ravaged by the Goths, and a Succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps, the <NORP>British</NORP> island separated itself from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn; all <GPE>Britain</GPE> was abandoned without defence, to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> pirates and the savages of <GPE>Ireland</GPE> and Caledonia.
 The Britons, reduced to this extremity, no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy.
 They assembled in arms, repelled the invaders, and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength.
 (173) Afflicted by similar calamities, and actuated by the same spirit, the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> provinces (a name which comprehended the maritime countries of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> between the <LOC>Seine</LOC> and the Loire)(174) resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island.
 They expelled the <NORP>Roman</NORP> magistrate, who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine; and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master.
 The independence of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> was soon confirmed by <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the lawful emperor of the West; and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty.
 This interpretation was, in some measure, justified by the event.
 After the usurpers of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had successively fallen, the maritime provinces were restored to the empire.
 Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious: the vain, the inconstant, rebellious disposition of the people, was incompatible either with freedom or servitude; (175) and Armorica, though it could not long maintain the form of a republic, (176) was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts.
 <GPE>Britain</GPE> was irrecoverably lost.
 (177) But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province, the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion; and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship.

D.
 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
(189) Assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces of Gaul, A.
D.
 418.
 It is somewhat remarkable, or rather it is extremely natural, that the revolt of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <GPE>Armorica</GPE> should have introduced an appearance of liberty into the obedient provinces of Gaul.
 In a solemn edict,(190) filled with the strongest assurances of that paternal affection which princes so often express, and so seldom feel, the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces: a name peculiarly appropriated to <NORP>Aquitain</NORP> and the ancient Narbonnese, which had long since exchanged their <NORP>Celtic</NORP> rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy.
 (191) Arles, the seat of government and commerce, was appointed for the place of the assembly, which regularly continued twenty-eight days, from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of <DATE>September</DATE> of every year.
 It consisted of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the Gauls; of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provincial governors, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> consular, and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> presidents; of the magistrates, and perhaps the bishops, of about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> cities; and of a competent, though indefinite, number of the most honourable and opulent possessors of land, who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country.
 They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign; to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents; to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes; and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> provinces.
 If such an institution, which gave the people an interest in their own government, had been universally established by <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or the Antonines, the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome.
 The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented, in some degree, or corrected, by the interposition of these representative assemblies; and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen.
 Under the mild and generous influence of liberty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire might have remained invincible and immortal; or if its excessive magnitude, and the instability of human affairs, had opposed such perpetual continuance, its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire, when every principle of health and life had been exhausted, the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects.
 The emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited.
 A fine of three, or even five, pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives, who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution, as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors.

 <CARDINAL>420</CARDINAL> etc The ruin of the opulent provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> may be dated from the establishment of these barbarians, whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive, and who were capriciously impelled, by interest or passion, to violate the public peace.
 A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war; the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers, for the use of their families, their slaves, and their cattle; and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers.
 Yet these domestic misfortunes, which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people, had been felt and inflicted by the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves, not only in the insolence of foreign conquest, but in the madness of civil discord.

 409-449 This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government; and the independent country, during a period of forty years, till the descent of the Saxons, was ruled by the authority of the clergy, the nobles, and the municipal towns.
(179) I.
 Zosimus, who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction, very accurately observes that the letters of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were addressed to the cities of Britain.
 (180) Under the protection of the Romans, <CARDINAL>ninety-two</CARDINAL> considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province; and, among these, <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance.
 (181) Each of these cities, as in all the other provinces of the empire, formed a legal corporation, for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy; and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates, a select senate, and the assembly of the people, according to the original model of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution.
 (182) The management of a common revenue, the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the habits of public counsel and command, were inherent to these petty republics; and when they asserted their independence, the youth of the city, and of the adjacent districts, would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate.
 But the desire of obtaining the advantages, and of escaping the burthens, of political society, is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord; nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of <NORP>British</NORP> freedom was exempt from tumult and faction.
 The pre-eminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens; and the haughty nobles, who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants, (183) would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch.
 II.
.
 The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators; and the smaller towns, the villages, and the proprietors of land, consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics.
 The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness; but the hereditary lords of ample possessions, who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city, aspired to the rank of independent princes, and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war.
 The gardens and villas, which exhibited some faint imitation of <NORP>Italian</NORP> elegance, would soon be converted into strong castles, the refuge, in time of danger, of the adjacent country:(184) the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses; to maintain a military force of slaves, of peasants, and of licentious followers: and the chieftain might assume, within his own domain, the powers of a civil magistrate.
 Several of these <NORP>British</NORP> chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings; and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy, and to vindicate there hereditary claims, which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars.
(185) Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress, the language, and the customs of their ancestors.
 If the princes of <GPE>Britain</GPE> relapsed into barbarism, while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome, the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national parties, again broken into a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment.
 The public strength, instead of being united against a foreign enemy, was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels; and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities, and to claim a rank among the tyrants(186) who infested <GPE>Britain</GPE> after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government.
 III.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops, (187) with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy; and the want of riches (for they seem to have been poor)(188) would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behaviour.
 The interest, as well as the temper, of the clergy, was favourable to the peace and union of their distracted country: those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses; and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly.
 In such councils, where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops, the important affairs of the state, as well as of the church, might be freely debated, differences reconciled, alliances formed, contributions imposed, wise resolutions often concerted, and sometimes executed; and there is reason to believe, that, in moments of extreme danger, a Pendragon, or Dictator, was elected by the general consent of the Britons.
 These pastoral cares, so worthy of the episcopal character, were interrupted, however, by zeal and superstition; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the <NORP>Pelagian</NORP> heresy, which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country.
