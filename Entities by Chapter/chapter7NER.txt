The elevation and tyranny of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> - Rebellion in <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Italy, under the <ORG>Authority</ORG> of the <ORG>Senate</ORG> - Civil Wars and Seditions - Violent deaths of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> and his son, of <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> and Balbinus, and of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Gordians</PERSON> - surpation and secular games of <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> The apparent ridicule Of the various forms of government which have prevailed in the world, an hereditary monarchy seems to present the fairest scope for ridicule.
 Is it possible to relate, without an indignant smile, that, on the father's decease, the property of a nation, like that of a drove of oxen, descends to his infant son, as yet unknown to mankind and to himself; and that the bravest warriors and the wisest statesmen, relinquishing their natural right to empire, approach the royal cradle with bended knees and protestations of inviolable fidelity? Satire and declamation may paint these obvious topics in the most dazzling colours, but our more serious thoughts will respect a useful prejudice, that establishes a rule of succession, independent of the passions of mankind; and we shall cheerfully acquiesce in any expedient which deprives the multitude of the dangerous, and indeed the ideal, power of giving themselves a master.
 and solid advantages of hereditary succession.
 In the cool shade of retirement, we may easily devise imaginary forms of government, in which the sceptre shall be constantly bestowed on the most worthy, by the free and incorrupt suffrage of the whole community.
 Experience overturns these airy fabrics, and teaches us that, in a large society, the election of a monarch can never devolve to the wisest, or to the most numerous, part of the people.
 The army is the only order of men sufficiently united to concur in the same sentiments, and powerful enough to impose them on the rest of their fellow-citizens: but the temper of soldiers, habituated at once to violence and to slavery, renders them very unfit guardians of a legal or even a civil, constitution.
 Justice, humanity, or political wisdom, are qualities they are too little acquainted with in themselves, to appreciate them in others.
 <ORG>Valour</ORG> will acquire their esteem, and liberality will purchase their suffrage; but the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these merits is often lodged in the most savage breasts; the latter can only exert itself at the expense of the public; and both may be turned against the possessor of the throne, by the ambition of a daring rival.
 Want of it in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire productive of the geatrest calamities The superior prerogative of birth, when it has obtained the sanction of time and popular opinion, is the plainest and least invidious of all distinctions among mankind.
 The acknowledged right extinguishes the hopes of faction, and the conscious security disarms the cruelty of the monarch.
 To the firm establishment of this idea, we owe the peaceful succession, and mild administration, of <NORP>European</NORP> monarchies.
 To the defect of it, we must attribute the frequent civil wars, through which an <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> despot is obliged to cut his way to the throne of his fathers.
 Yet, even in the East, the sphere of contention is usually limited to the princes of the reigning house, and as soon as the more fortunate competitor has removed his brethren, by the sword and the bowstring, he no longer entertains any jealousy of his meaner subjects.
 But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, after the authority of the senate had sunk into contempt, was a vast scene of confusion.
 The royal, and even noble, families of the provinces, had long since been led in triumph before the car of the haughty republicans.
 The ancient families of <GPE>Rome</GPE> had successively fallen beneath the tyranny of the Caesars, and whilst those princes were shackled by the forms of a commonwealth, and disappointed by the repeated failure of their posterity, (1) it was impossible that any idea of hereditary succession should have taken root in the minds of their subjects.
 The right to the throne, which none could claim from birth, every <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> assumed from merit.
 The daring hopes of ambition were set loose from the salutary restraints of law and prejudice; and the meanest of mankind might, without folly, entertain a hope of being raised by valour and fortune to a rank in the army, in which a single crime would enable him to wrest the sceptre of the world from his feeble and unpopular master.
 After the murder of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> Severus, and the elevation of Maximin, no emperor could think himself safe upon the throne and every barbarian peasant of the frontier might aspire to that august, but dangerous station.
 Birth and fortune of Maximin.
 About thirty-two years before that event, the emperor Severus, returning from an eastern expedition, halted in Thrace, to celebrate, with military games, the birthday of his younger son, Geta.
 The country flocked in crowds to behold their sovereign, and a young barbarian of gigantic stature earnestly solicited, in his rude dialect, that he might be allowed to contend for the prize of wrestling.
 As the pride of discipline would have been disgraced in the overthrow of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> soldier by a <PERSON>Thracian</PERSON> peasant, he was matched with the stoutest followers of the camp, <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> of whom he successively laid on the ground.
 His victory was rewarded by some trifling gifts, and a permission to enlist in the troops.
 The next day, the happy barbarian was distinguished above a crowd of recruits, dancing and exulting after the fashion of his country.
 As soon as he perceived that he had attracted the emperor's notice, he instantly ran up to his horse, and followed him on foot, without the least appearance of fatigue, in a long and rapid career.
 Most willingly, Sir, replied the unwearied youth, and, almost in a breath, overthrew <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> of the strongest soldiers in the army.
 A gold collar was the prize of his matchless vigour and activity, and he was immediately appointed to serve in the horse-guards who always attended on the person of the sovereign.
 (2) His military service and honours.
 Maximin, for that was his name, though born on the territories of the empire descended from a mixed race of barbarians.
 His father was a Goth, and his mother of the nation of the Alani.
 He displayed, on every occasion, a valour equal to his strength; and his native fierceness was soon tempered or disguised by the knowledge of the world.
 Under the reign of <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> and his son, he obtained the rank of centurion, with the favour and esteem of both those princes, the former of whom was an excellent judge of merit.
 Gratitude forbade <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> to serve under the assassin of Caracalla.
 Honour taught him to decline the effeminate insults of Elagabalus.
 On the accession of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> he returned to court, and was placed by that prince in a station useful to the service and honourable to himself.
 The <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> legion, to which he was appointed tribune, soon became, under his care, the best disciplined of the whole army.
 With the general applause of the soldiers, who bestowed on their favourite hero the names of <PERSON>Ajax</PERSON> and Hercules, he was successively promoted to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> military command; (3) and had not he still retained too much of his savage origin, the emperor might perhaps have given his own sister in marriage to the son of Maximin.
 (4) Conspiracy of Maximin.
 Instead of securing his fidelity, these favours served only to inflame the ambition of the <PERSON>Thracian</PERSON> peasant, who deemed his fortune inadequate to his merit, as long as he was constrained to acknowledge a superior.
 Though a stranger to real wisdom, he was not devoid of a selfish cunning, which showed him that the emperor had lost the affection of the army, and taught him to improve their discontent to his own advantage.
 It is easy for faction and calumny to shed their poison on the administration of the best of princes, and to accuse even their virtues, by artfully confounding them with those vices to which they bear the nearest affinity.
 The troops listened with pleasure to the emissaries of Maximin.
 They blushed at their own ignominious patience, which, during thirteen years, had supported the vexatious discipline imposed by an effeminate Syrian, the timid slave of his mother and of the senate.
 It was time, they cried, to cast away that useless phantom of the civil power, and to elect for their prince and general a real soldier, educated in camps, exercised in war, who would assert the glory, and distribute among his companions the treasures, of the empire.
 A great army was at that time assembled on the banks of the Rhine, under the command of the emperor himself, who, almost immediately after his return from the Persian war, had been obliged to march against the barbarians of Germany.
 The important care of training and reviewing the new levies was intrusted to Maximin.
 One day (A.
D.
 235, <DATE>March</DATE> 19), as he entered the field of exercise the troops, either from a sudden impulse or a formed conspiracy, saluted him emperor, silenced by their loud acclamations his obstinate refusal, and hastened to consummate their rebellion by the murder of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> Severus.
 Murder of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> The circumstances of his death are variously related.
 The writers, who supposed that he died in ignorance of the ingratitude and ambition of Maximin, affirm that, after taking a frugal repast in the sight of the army, he retired to sleep, and that, about the seventh hour of the day, a part of his own guards broke into the imperial tent, and with many wounds assassinated their virtuous and unsuspecting prince.
 (5) If we credit another, and indeed a more probable account, <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> was invested with the purple by a numerous detachment, at the distance of several miles from the headquarters; and he trusted for success rather to the secret wishes than to the public declarations of the great army.
 <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> had sufficient time to awaken a faint sense of loyalty among his troops; but their reluctant professions of fidelity quickly vanished on the appearance of Maximin, who declared himself the friend and advocate of the military order, and was unanimously acknowledged emperor of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the applauding legions.
 The son of Mamaea, betrayed and deserted, withdrew into his tent, desirous at least to conceal his approaching fate from the insults of the multitude.
 He was soon followed by a tribune and some centurions, the ministers of death; but, instead of receiving with manly resolution the inevitable stroke, his unavailing cries and entreaties disgraced the last moments of his life, and converted into contempt some portion of the just pity which his innocence and misfortunes must inspire.
 His mother Mamaea, whose pride and avarice he loudly accused as the causes, of his ruin, perished with her son.
 The most faithful of his friends were sacrificed to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fury of the soldiers.
 Others were reserved for the more deliberate cruelty of the usurper; and those who experienced the mildest treatment, were stripped of their employments, and ignominiously driven from the court and army.
 (6) Tyranny of Maximin.
 The former tyrants, <PERSON>Caligula</PERSON> and Nero, <NORP>Commodus</NORP> and Caracalla, were all dissolute and inexperienced youths, (7) educated in the purple, and corrupted by the pride of empire, the luxury of Rome, and the perfidious voice of flattery.
 The cruelty of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> was derived from a different source, the fear of contempt.
 Though he depended on the attachment of the soldiers, who loved him for virtues like their own, he was conscious that his mean and barbarian origin, his savage appearance, and his total ignorance of the arts and institutions of civil life, (8) formed a very unfavourable contrast with the amiable manners of the unhappy Alexander.
 He remembered that, in his humbler fortune, he had often waited before the door of the haughty nobles of Rome, and had been denied admittance by the insolence of their slaves.
 He recollected, too, the friendship of a few who had relieved his poverty, and assisted his rising hopes.
 But those who had spurned, and those who had protected the Thracian, were guilty of the same crime, the knowledge of his original obscurity.
 For this crime many were put to death; and by the execution of several of his benefactors, <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> published, in characters of blood, the indelible history of his baseness and ingratitude.
 (9) The dark and sanguinary soul of the tyrant was open to every suspicion against those among his subjects who were the most distinguished by their birth or merit.
 Whenever he was alarmed with the sound of treason, his cruelty was unbounded and unrelenting.
 A conspiracy against his life was either discovered or imagined, and Magnus, a consular senator, was named as the principal author of it.
 Without a witness, without a trial, and without an opportunity of defence, Magnus, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand of his supposed accomplices, was put to death.
 <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the whole empire were infested with innumerable spies and informers.
 On the slightest accusation, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobles, who had governed provinces, commanded armies, and been adorned with the consular arid triumphal ornaments, were chained on the public carriages, and hurried away to the emperor's presence.
 Confiscation, exile, or simple death, were esteemed uncommon instances of his lenity.
 Some of the unfortunate sufferers he ordered to be sewed up in the hides of slaughtered animals, others to be exposed to wild beasts, others again to be beaten to death with clubs.
 During the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years of his reign, he disdained to visit either <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Italy.
 His camp, occasionally removed from the banks of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to those of the Danube, was the seat of his stern despotism, which trampled on every principle of law and justice, and was supported by the avowed power of the sword.
 (10) No man of noble birth, elegant accomplishments, or knowledge of civil business, was suffered near his person; and the court of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor revived the idea of those ancient chiefs of slaves and gladiators, whose savage power had left a deep impression of terror and detestation .
 (11) Oppression of the provinces As long as the cruelty of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> was confined to the illustrious senators, or even to the bold adventurers, who in the court or army expose themselves to the caprice of fortune, the body of the people viewed their sufferings with indifference, or perhaps with pleasure.
 But the tyrant's avarice, stimulated by the insatiate desires of the soldiers, at length attacked the public property.
 Every city of the empire was possessed of an independent revenue, destined to purchase corn for the multitude, and to supply the expenses of the games and entertainments.
 By a single act of authority, the whole mass of wealth was at once confiscated for the use of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> treasury.
 The temples were stripped of their most valuable offerings of gold and silver, and the statues of gods, heroes, and emperors, were melted down and coined into money.
 These impious orders could not be executed without tumults and massacres, as in many places the people chose rather to die in the defence of their altars, than to behold in the midst of peace their cities exposed to the rapine and cruelty of war.
 The soldiers themselves, among whom this sacrilegious plunder was distributed, received it with a blush; and, hardened as they were in acts of violence, they dreaded the just reproaches of their friends and relations.
 Throughout the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world a general cry of indignation was heard, imploring vengeance on the common enemy of human kind; and at length, by an act of private oppression, a peaceful and unarmed province was driven into rebellion against him.
 (12) Revolt in <LOC>Africa</LOC> The procurator of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was a servant worthy of such a master, who considered the fines and confiscations of the rich as <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most fruitful branches of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> revenue.
 An iniquitous sentence had been (A.
D.
 237, April) pronounced against some opulent youths of that country, the execution of which would have stripped them of far the greater part of their patrimony.
 In this extremity, a resolution that must either complete or prevent their ruin, was dictated by despair.
 A respite of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days, obtained with difficulty from the rapacious treasurer, was employed in collecting from their estates a great number of slaves and peasants, blindly devoted to the commands of their lords, and armed with the rustic weapons of clubs and axes.
 The leaders of the conspiracy, as they were admitted to the audience of the procurator stabbed him with the daggers concealed under their garments, and, by the assistance of their tumultuary train, seized on the little town of Thysdrus, (13) and erected the standard of rebellion against the sovereign of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 They rested their hopes on the hatred of mankind against Maximin, and they judiciously resolved to oppose to that detested tyrant an emperor whose mild virtues had already acquired the love and esteem of the Romans, and whose authority over the province would give weight and stability to the enterprise.
 Gordianus, their proconsul, and the object of their choice, refused, with unfeigned reluctance, the dangerous honour, and begged with tears that they would suffer him to terminate in peace a long and innocent life, without staining his feeble age with civil blood.
 Their menaces compelled him to accept the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, his only refuge indeed against the jealous cruelty of Maximin; since, according to the reasoning of tyrants, those who have been esteemed worthy of the throne deserve death, and those who deliberate have already rebelled.
 (14) Character and elevation of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Gordians</PERSON> The family of <PERSON>Gordianus</PERSON> was <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate.
 On the father's side, he was descended from the Gracchi; on his mother's, from the emperor Trajan.
 A great estate enabled him to support the dignity of this birth, and, in the enjoyment of it, he displayed an elegant taste and beneficent disposition.
 The palace in Rome, formerly inhabited by the great Pompey, had been, during several generations, in the possession of Gordian's family.
 (15) It was distinguished by ancient trophies of naval victories, and decorated with the works of modern painting.
 His villa on the road to <GPE>Praeneste</GPE> was celebrated for baths of singular beauty and extent, for <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> stately rooms of an hundred feet in length, and for a magnificent portico, supported by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred columns of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> most curious and costly sorts of marble.
 (16) The public shows exhibited at his expense, and in which the people were entertained with many <CARDINAL>hundreds</CARDINAL> of wild beasts and gladiators, (17) seem to surpass the fortune of a subject; and whilst the liberality of other magistrates was confined to a few solemn festivals in Rome, the magnificence of <PERSON>Gordian</PERSON> was repeated, when he was ardile, every month in the year, and extended, during his consulship, to the principal cities of Italy.
 He was twice elevated to the last-mentioned dignity, by <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> and by Alexander; for he possessed the uncommon talent of acquiring the esteem of virtuous princes, without alarming the jealousy of tyrants.
 His long life was innocently spent in the study of letters and the peaceful honours of Rome; and, till he was named proconsul of <LOC>Africa</LOC> by the voice of the senate and the approbation of Alexander, (18) he appears prudently to have declined the command of armies and the government of provinces.
 As long as that emperor lived, <LOC>Africa</LOC> was happy under the administration of his worthy representative; after the barbarous <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> had usurped the throne, <PERSON>Gordianus</PERSON> alleviated the miseries which he was unable to prevent.
 When he reluctantly accepted the purple, he was above four-score years old; a last and valuable remains of the happy age of the Antonines, whose virtues he revived in his own conduct and celebrated in an elegant poem of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> books.
 With the venerable proconsul, his son, who had accompanied him into <LOC>Africa</LOC> as his lieutenant, was likewise declared emperor.
 His manners were less pure, but his character was equally amiable with that of his father.
 <CARDINAL>Twenty-two</CARDINAL> acknowledged concubines, and a library of sixty-two thousand volumes, attested the variety of his inclinations, and from the productions which he left behind him, it appears that the former as well as the latter were designed for use rather than ostentation.
 (19) The <NORP>Roman</NORP> people acknowledged in the features of the younger <PERSON>Gordian</PERSON> the resemblance of Scipio Africanus, recollected with pleasure that his mother was the grand-daughter of Antoninus Pius, and rested the public hope on those latent virtues which had hitherto, as they fondly imagined, lain concealed in the luxurious indolence of a private life.
 They solicit the confirmation of their authority.
 As soon as the <PERSON>Gordians</PERSON> had appeased the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> tumult of a popular election, they removed their court to Carthage.
 They were received with the acclamations of the Africans, who honoured their virtues, and who, since the visit of Hadrian, had never beheld the majesty of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 But these vain acclamations neither strengthened nor confirmed the title of the Gordians.
 They were induced by principle, as well as interest, to solicit the approbation of the senate; and a deputation of the noblest provincials was sent, without delay, to Rome, to relate and justify the conduct of their countrymen, who, having long suffered with patience, were at length resolved to act with vigour.
 The letters of the new princes were modest and respectful, excusing the necessity which had obliged them to accept the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> title; but submitting their election and their fate to the supreme judgment of the senate.
 (20) The senate ratifies their election of the Gordians.
 The inclinations of the senate were neither doubtful nor divided.
 The birth and noble alliances of the <PERSON>Gordians</PERSON> had intimately connected them with the most illustrious houses of Rome.
 Their fortune had created many dependents in that assembly, their merit had acquired many friends.
 Their mild administration opened the flattering prospect of the restoration not only of the civil but even of the <NORP>republican</NORP> government.
 The terror of military violence, which had <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> obliged the senate to forget the murder of Alexander, and to ratify the election of a barbarian peasant, (21) now produced a contrary effect, and provoked them to assert the injured rights of; freedom and humanity.
 The hatred of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> towards the senate was declared and implacable; the tamest submission had not appeased his fury, the most cautious innocence would not remove his suspicions; and even the care of their own safety urged them to share the fortune of an enterprise, of which (if unsuccessful) they were sure to be the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> victims.
 These considerations, and perhaps others of a more private nature, were debated in a previous conference of the consuls and the magistrates.
 As soon as their resolution was decided, they convoked in the temple of <PERSON>Castor</PERSON> the whole body of the senate, according to an ancient form of secrecy, (22) calculated to awaken their attention, and to conceal their decrees.
 The noble ardour of the consul revived the languid spirit of the senate.
 By an unanimous decree the election of the <PERSON>Gordians</PERSON> was ratified, Maximin, his son, and his adherents, were pronounced enemies of their country, and liberal rewards were offered to whomsoever had the courage and good fortune to destroy them.
 Assumes the command of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> During the emperor's absence, a detachment of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards remained at Rome, to protect, or rather to command, the capital.
 The <PERSON>Praefect</PERSON> Vitalianus had signalised his fidelity to Maximin, by the alacrity with which he had obeyed, and even prevented, the cruel mandates of the tyrant.
 His death alone could rescue the authority of the senate, and the lives of the senators, from a state of danger and suspense.
 Before their resolves had transpired, a quaestor and some tribunes were commissioned to take his devoted life.
 They executed the order with equal boldness and success; and, with their bloody daggers in their hands, ran through the streets proclaiming to the people and the soldiers the news of the happy revolution.
 The enthusiasm of liberty was seconded by the promise of a large donative, in lands and money; the statues of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> were thrown down; the capital of the empire acknowledged, with transport, the authority of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Gordians</PERSON> and the senate, (24) and the example of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was followed by the rest of Italy.
 and prepares for a civil war.
 A new spirit had arisen in that assembly, whose long patience had been insulted by wanton despotism and military licence.
 The senate assumed the reins of government, and, with a calm intrepidity, prepared to vindicate by arms the cause of freedom.
 Among the consular senators recommended by their merit and services to the favour of the emperor Alexander, it was easy to select twenty, not unequal to the command of an army, and the conduct of a war.
 To these was the defence of <GPE>Italy</GPE> intrusted.
 Each was appointed to act in his respective department authorised to enrol and discipline the <NORP>Italian</NORP> youth; and instructed to fortify the ports and highways against the impending invasion of Maximin.
 A number of deputies, chosen from the most illustrious of the senatorian and equestrian orders, were dispatched at the same time to the governors of the several provinces, earnestly conjuring them to fly to the assistance of their country, and to remind the nations of their ancient ties of friendship with the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate and people.
 The general respect with which these deputies were received, and the zeal of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces in favour of the senate, efficiently prove that the subjects of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> were reduced to that uncommon distress, in which the body of the people has more to fear from oppression than from resistance.
 The consciousness of that melancholy truth inspires a degree of persevering fury seldom to be found in those civil wars which are artificially supported for the benefit of a few factious and designing leaders.
 (25) Defeat and death of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Gordians.
 For while the cause of the <PERSON>Gordians</PERSON> was embraced with such diffusive ardour, the <PERSON>Gordians</PERSON> themselves were no more (A.
D.
 237, 3rd July) were no more.
 The feeble court of <GPE>Carthage</GPE> was alarmed with the rapid approach of Capelianus, governor of Mauritania, who, with a small band of veterans, and a fierce host of barbarians, attacked a faithful but unwarlike province.
 The younger <PERSON>Gordian</PERSON> sallied out to meet the enemy at the head of a few guards, and a numerous undisciplined multitude, educated in the peaceful usury of Carthage.
 His useless valour served only to procure him an honourable death, in he field of battle.
 His aged father, whose reign had not exceeded thirty-six days, put an end to his life on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> news of the defeat.
 Carthage, destitute of defence, opened her gates to the conqueror, and <LOC>Africa</LOC> was exposed to the rapacious cruelty of a slave, obliged to satisfy his unrelenting master with a large account of blood and treasure.
 (26) Election of <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Balbinus</PERSON> by the senate.
 9th July The fate of the <PERSON>Gordians</PERSON> filled <GPE>Rome</GPE> with just, but unexpected terror.
 The senate convoked in the temple of Concord, affected to transact the common business of the day; and seemed to decline, with trembling anxiety, the consideration of their own and the public danger.
 A silent consternation prevailed on the assembly, till a senator, of the name and family of Trajan, awakened his brethren from their fatal lethargy.
 He represented to them, that the choice of cautious dilatory measures had been long since out of their power; that Maximin, implacable by nature, and exasperated by injuries, was advancing towards Italy, at the head of the military force of the empire; and that their only remaining alternative was either to meet him bravely in the field, or tamely to expect the tortures and ignominious death reserved for unsuccessful rebellion.
 The general apprehension silenced the whispers of jealousy; the merit of the candidates was universally acknowledged; and the house resounded with the sincere acclamations, of Their characters.
 The virtues and the reputation of the new emperors justified the most sanguine hopes of the Romans.
 The various nature of their talents seemed to appropriate to each his peculiar department of peace and war, without leaving room for jealous emulation.
 <PERSON>Balbinus</PERSON> was an admired orator, a poet of distinguished fame, and a wise magistrate, who had exercised with innocence and applause the civil jurisdiction in almost all the interior provinces of the empire.
 His birth was noble (28) his fortune affluent, his manners liberal and affable.
 In him the love of pleasure was corrected by a sense of dignity, nor had the habits of ease deprived him of a capacity for business.
 The mind of <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> was formed in a rougher mould.
 By his valour and abilities he had raised himself from the meanest origin to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> employments of the state and army.
 His victories over the <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> and the Germans, the austerity of his life, and the rigid impartiality of his justice, whilst he was <PERSON>Praefect</PERSON> of the city, commanded the esteem of a people, whose affections were engaged in favour of the more amiable Balbinus.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> colleagues had both been consuls (Balbinus had twice enjoyed that honourable office), both had been named among the <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> lieutenants of the senate; and since the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> was <DATE>sixty</DATE> and the other seventy-four years old, (29) they had both attained the full maturity of age and experience.
 Tumult at Rome.
 The younger <PERSON>Gordian</PERSON> is declared <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> After the senate had conferred on <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Balbinus</PERSON> an equal portion of the consular and tribunitian powers, the title of Fathers of their country, and the joint office of Supreme Pontiff, they ascended to the Capitol, to return thanks to the gods, protectors of Rome.
 (30) The solemn rites of sacrifice were disturbed by a sedition of the people.
 The licentious multitude neither loved the rigid Maximus, nor did they sufficiently fear the mild and humane Balbinus.
 Their increasing numbers surrounded the temple of Jupiter; with obstinate clamours they asserted their inherent right of consenting to the election of their sovereign; and demanded, with an apparent moderation, that, besides the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors chosen by the senate, a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> should be added of the family of the Gordians, as a just return of gratitude to those princes who had sacrificed their lives for the republic.
 At the head of the city-guards, and the youth of the equestrian order, <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Balbinus</PERSON> attempted to cut their way through the seditious multitude.
 The multitude, armed with sticks and stones, drove them back into the Capitol.
 It is prudent to yield when the contest, whatever may be the issue of it, must be fatal to both parties.
 A boy, only thirteen years of age, the grandson of the elder, and nephew of the younger, Gordian, was produced to the people, invested with the ornaments and title of Caesar.
 The tumult was appeased by this easy condescension; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, as soon as they had been peaceably acknowledged in Rome, prepared to defend <GPE>Italy</GPE> against the common enemy.
 <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> prepares to attack the senate and the emperors Whilst in <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> revolutions succeeded each other with such amazing rapidity, the mind of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> was agitated by the most furious passions.
 He is said to have received the news of the rebellion of the Gordians, and of the decree of the senate against him, not with the temper of a man, but the rage of a wild beast; which, as it could not discharge itself on the distant senate, threatened the life of his son, of his friends, and of all who ventured to approach his person.
 The grateful intelligence of the death of the <PERSON>Gordians</PERSON> was quickly followed by the assurance that the senate, laying aside all hopes of pardon or accommodation, had substituted in their room <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, with whose merit he could not be unacquainted.
 Revenge was the only consolation left to Maximin, and revenge could only be obtained by arms.
 The strength of the legions had been assembled by <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> from all parts of the empire.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> successful campaigns against the <NORP>Germans</NORP> and the <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> had raised their fame, confirmed their discipline, and even increased their numbers, by filling the ranks with the flower of the barbarian youth.
 The life of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> had been spent in war, and the candid severity of history cannot refuse him the valour of a soldier, or even the abilities of an experienced general.
 (31) It might naturally be expected that a prince of such a character, instead of suffering the rebellion to gain stability by delay, should immediately have marched from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to those of the Tiber, and that his victorious army, instigated by contempt for the senate, and eager to gather the spoils of Italy, should have burned with impatience to finish the easy and lucrative conquest.
 Yet as far as we can trust to the obscure chronology of that period, (32) it appears that the operations of some foreign war deferred the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition till the ensuing spring.
 From the prudent conduct of Maximin, we may learn that the savage features of his character have been exaggerated by the pencil of party, that his passions, however impetuous, submitted to the force of reason, and that the barbarian possessed something of the generous spirit of Sylla, who subdued the enemies of <GPE>Rome</GPE> before he suffered himself to revenge his private injuries.
 (33) Marches into Italy.
 A.
D.
 238 <DATE>February</DATE> When the troops of Maximin, advancing in excellent order, arrived at the foot of the Julian Alps, they were terrified by the silence and desolation that reigned on the frontiers of Italy.
 The villages and open towns had been abandoned on their approach by the inhabitants, the cattle was driven away, the provisions removed, or destroyed, the bridges broke down, nor was anything left which could afford either shelter or give subsistence to an invader.
 Such had been the wise orders of the generals of the senate, whose design was to protract the war, to ruin the army of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> by the slow operation of famine, and to consume his strength in the sieges of the principal cities of Italy, which they had plentifully stored with men and provisions from the deserted country.
 Siege of <PERSON>Aquileia</PERSON> <PERSON>Aquileia</PERSON> received and withstood the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> shock of the invasion.
 The streams that issue from the head of the Hadriatic gulf, swelled by the melting of the <DATE>winter</DATE> snows, (34) opposed an unexpected obstacle to the arms of Maximin.
 At length, on a singular bridge, constructed with art and difficulty of large hogsheads, he transported his army to the opposite bank, rooted up the beautiful vineyards in the neighbourhood of Aquileia, demolished the suburbs, and employed the timber of the buildings in the engines and towers, with which on every side he attacked the city.
 The walls fallen to decay during the security of a long peace, had been hastily repaired on this sudden emergency; but the firmest defence of <PERSON>Aquileia</PERSON> consisted in the constancy of the citizens; all ranks of whom, instead of being dismayed, were animated by the extreme danger, and their knowledge of the tyrant's unrelenting temper.
 Their courage was supported and directed by <PERSON>Crispinus</PERSON> and Menophilus, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of the <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> lieutenants of the senate, who, with a small body of regular troops, had thrown themselves into the besieged place.
 The army of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> was repulsed on repeated attacks, his machines destroyed by showers of artificial fire; and the generous enthusiasm of the <NORP>Aquileians</NORP> was exalted into a confidence of success, by the opinion that Belenus, their tutelar deity, combated in person in the defence of his distressed worshippers.
 (35) Conduct of Maximus.
 The emperor Maximus, who had advanced as far as Ravenna, to secure that important place, and to hasten the military preparations beheld the event of the war in the more faithful mirror of reason and policy.
 He was too sensible that a single town could not resist the persevering efforts of a great army; and he dreaded lest the enemy, tired with the obstinate resistance of Aquileia, should on a sudden relinquish the fruitless siege, and march directly towards Rome.
 The fate of the empire and the cause of freedom must then be committed to the chance of a battle; and what arms could he oppose to the veteran legions of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and the Danube? Some troops newly levied among the generous but enervated youth of Italy; and a body of <NORP>German</NORP> auxiliaries, on whose firmness, in the hour of trial, it was dangerous to depend.
.
 In the midst of these just alarms, the stroke of domestic conspiracy punished the crimes of Maximin, and delivered <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the senate from the calamities that would surely have attended the victory of an enraged barbarian.
 Murder of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> and his son.
 A.
D.
 238 <DATE>April</DATE> The people of <PERSON>Aquileia</PERSON> had scarcely experienced any of the common miseries of a siege, their magazines were plentifully supplied, and several fountains within the walls assured them of an inexhaustible resource of fresh water.
 The soldiers of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> were, on the contrary, exposed to the inclemency of the season, the contagion of disease, and the horrors of famine.
 The open country was ruined, the rivers filled with the slain, and polluted with blood.
 A spirit of despair and disaffection began to diffuse itself among the troops; and as they were cut off from all intelligence, they easily believed that the whole empire had embraced the cause of the senate, and that they were left as devoted victims to perish under the impregnable walls of Aquileia.
 The fierce temper of the tyrant was exasperated by disappointments, which he imputed to the cowardice of his army; and his wanton and ill-timed cruelty, instead of striking terror, inspired hatred and a just desire of revenge.
 A party of <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards, who trembled for their wives and children in the camp of Alba, near Rome, executed the sentence of the senate.
 Maximin, abandoned by his guards, was (A.
D.
 238, April) slain in his tent, with his son (whom he had associated to the honours of the purple), <PERSON>Anulinus</PERSON> the praefect, and the principal ministers of his tyranny.
 (36) The sight of their heads, borne on the point of spears, convinced the citizens of Aquileia, that the siege was at an end; the gates of the city were thrown open, a liberal market was provided for the hungry troops of Maximin, and the whole army joined in solemn protestations of fidelity to the senate and the people of Rome, and to their lawful emperors <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> and Balbinus.
 His portrait Such was the deserved fate of a brutal savage, destitute, as he has generally been represented, of every sentiment that distinguishes a civilised, or even a human being.
 The body was suited to the soul.
 The stature of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> exceeded the measure of eight feet, and circumstances almost incredible are related of his matchless strength and appetite.
 (37) Had he lived in a less enlightened age, tradition and poetry might well have described him as <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of those monstrous giants, whose supernatural power was constantly exerted for the destruction of mankind.
 Joy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 It is easier to conceive than to describe the universal joy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world on the fall of the tyrant, the news of which is said to have been carried in <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> days from <PERSON>Aquileia</PERSON> to Rome.
 The return of <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> was a triumphal procession, his colleague and young <PERSON>Gordian</PERSON> went out to meet him, and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> princes made their entry into the capital, attended by the ambassadors of almost all the cities of Italy, saluted with the splendid offerings of gratitude and superstition, and received with the unfeigned acclamations of the senate and people, who persuaded themselves that a golden age would succeed to an age of iron.
 (38) The conduct of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors correspond with these expectations.
 They administered justice in person; and the rigour of the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> was tempered by the other's clemency.
 The oppressive taxes with which <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> had loaded the rights of inheritance and succession were repealed, or at least moderated.
 Discipline was revived, and with the advice of the senate many wise laws were enacted by their imperial ministers, who endeavoured to restart a civil constitution on the ruins of military tyranny.
 "What reward may we expect for delivering <GPE>Rome</GPE> from a monster?" was the question asked by Maximus, in a moment of freedom and confidence.
 <PERSON>Balbinus</PERSON> answered it without hesitation.
 "The love of the senate, of the people, and of all mankind.
" His apprehensions were but too well justified by the event.
Sedition at <GPE>Rome</GPE> Whilst <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> was preparing to defend <GPE>Italy</GPE> against the common foe, Balbinus, who remained at Rome, had been engaged in scenes of blood and intestine discord.
 Distrust and jealousy reigned in the senate; and even in the temples where they assembled, every senator carried either open or concealed arms.
 In the midst of their deliberations, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> veterans of the guards, actuated either by curiosity or a sinister motive, audaciously thrust themselves into the house, and advanced by degrees beyond the altar of Victory.
 Gallicanus, a consular, and Maecenas, a <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> senator, viewed with indignation their insolent intrusion: drawing their daggers, they laid the spies, for such they deemed them, dead at the foot of the altar, and then advancing to the door of the senate, imprudently exhorted the multitude to massacre the Praetorians, as the secret adherents of the tyrant.
 Those who escaped the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fury of the tumult took refuge in the camp, which they defended with superior advantage against the reiterated attacks of the people, assisted by the numerous bands of gladiators, the property of opulent nobles.
 The civil war lasted many days, with infinite loss and confusion on both sides.
 When the pipes were broken that supplied the camp with water, the <NORP>Praetorians</NORP> were reduced to intolerable distress; but in their turn they made desperate sallies into the city, set fire to a great number of houses, and filled the street with the blood of the inhabitants.
 The emperor <PERSON>Balbinus</PERSON> attempted, by ineffectual edicts and precarious truces, to reconcile the factions at Rome.
 But their animosity, though smothered for a while, burnt with redoubled violence.
 The soldiers, detesting the senate and the people, despised the weakness of a prince who wanted either the spirit or the power to command the obedience of his subjects.
 (40) Discontent of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards.
 After the tyrant's death, his formidable army had acknowledged, from necessity rather than from choice, the authority of Maximus, who transported himself without delay to the camp before Aquileia.
 As soon as he had received their oath of fidelity, he addressed them in terms full of mildness and moderation; lamented, rather than arraigned, the wild disorders of the times, and assured the soldiers, that of all their past conduct, the senate would remember only their generous desertion of the tyrant, and their voluntary return to their duty.
 <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> enforced his exhortations by a liberal donative, purified the camp by a solemn sacrifice of expiation, and then dismissed the legions to their several provinces, impressed, as he hoped, with a lively sense of gratitude and obedience.
 (41) But nothing could reconcile the haughty spirit of the Praetorians.
 They attended the emperors on the memorable day of their public entry into Rome; but amidst the general acclamations, the sullen dejected countenance of the guards sufficiently declared that they considered themselves as the object, rather than the partners, of the triumph.
 When the whole body was united in their camp, those who had served under Maximin, and those who had remained at Rome, insensibly communicated to each other their complaints and apprehensions.
 The emperors chosen by the army had perished with ignominy; those elected by the senate were seated on the throne.
 (42) The long discord between the civil and military powers was decided by a war, in which the former had obtained a complete victory.
 The soldiers must now learn a new doctrine of submission to the senate; and whatever clemency was affected by that politic assembly, they dreaded a slow revenge, coloured by the name of discipline, and justified by fair pretences of the public good.
 But their fate was still in their own hands; and if they had courage to despise the vain terrors of an impotent republic, it was easy to convince the world that those who were masters of the arms were masters of the authority, of the state.
 Massacre of <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Balbinus</PERSON> When the senate elected <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes, it is probable that, besides the declared reason of providing for the various emergencies of peace and war, they were actuated by the secret desire of weakening by division the despotism of the supreme magistrate.
 Their policy was effectual, but it proved fatal both to their emperors and to themselves.
 The jealousy of power was soon exasperated by the difference of character.
 <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> despised <PERSON>Balbinus</PERSON> as a luxurious noble, and was in his turn disdained by his colleague as an obscure soldier.
 Their silent discord was understood rather than seen ; (43) but the mutual consciousness prevented them from uniting in any vigorous measures of defence against their common enemies of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> camp.
 The whole city was (A.
D.
 238, July 15) employed in the Capitoline games, and the emperors were left almost alone in the palace.
 On a sudden they were alarmed by the approach of a troop of desperate assassins.
 Ignorant of each other's situation or designs, for they already occupied very distant apartments, afraid to give or to receive assistance, they wasted the important moments in idle debates and fruitless recriminations.
 The arrival of the guards put an end to the vain strife.
 They seized on these emperors of the senate, for such they called them with malicious contempt, stripped them of their garments, and dragged them in insolent triumph through the streets of Rome, with a design of inflicting a slow and cruel death on those unfortunate princes.
 The fear of a rescue from the faithful <NORP>Germans</NORP> of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guards, shortened their tortures; and their bodies, mangled with a thousand wounds, were left exposed to the insults or to the pity of the populace.
 (44) The <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Gordian</PERSON> remains sole emperor.
 In the space of a few months, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> princes had been cut off by the sword.
 Gordian, who had already received the title of Caesar, was the only person that occurred to the soldiers as proper to fill the vacant throne.
 (45) They carried him to the camp, and unanimously saluted him <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Emperor.
 His name was dear to the senate and people; his tender age promised a long impunity of military licence; and the submission of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the provinces to the choice of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards, saved the republic, at the expense indeed of its freedom and dignity, from the horrors of a new civil war in the heart of the capital.
 (46) Innocence and virtues of Gordian.
 As the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Gordian</PERSON> was only nineteen years of age at the time of his death, the history of his life, were it known to us with greater accuracy than it really is, would contain little more than the account of his education, and the conduct of the ministers, who by turns abused or guided the simplicity of his inexperienced youth.
 Immediately after his accession, he fell into the hands of his mother's eunuchs, that pernicious vermin of the East, who, since the days of Elagabalus, had infested the <NORP>Roman</NORP> palace.
 By the artful conspiracy of these wretches, an impenetrable veil was drawn between an innocent prince and his oppressed subjects, the virtuous disposition of <PERSON>Gordian</PERSON> was deceived, and the honours of the empire sold without his knowledge, though in a very public manner, to the most worthless of mankind.
 We are ignorant by what fortunate accident the emperor escaped from this ignominious slavery, and devolved his confidence on a minister whose wise counsels had no object except the glory of his sovereign and the happiness of the people.
 Administration of <PERSON>Misitheus</PERSON> It should seem that (A.
D.
 240) love and learning introduced <PERSON>Misitheus</PERSON> to the favour of Gordian.
 The young prince married he daughter of his master of rhetoric, and promoted his father-in-law to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> offices of the empire.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> admirable letters that passed between them are still extant.
 The minister, with the conscious dignity of virtue, congratulates <PERSON>Gordian</PERSON> that he is delivered from the tyranny of the eunuchs, (47) and still more that he is sensible of his deliverance.
 The emperor acknowledges, with an amiable confusion, the errors of his past conduct; and laments, with singular propriety, the misfortune of a monarch, from whom a venal tribe of courtiers perpetually labour to conceal the truth.
 (48) The Persian war.
 The life of <PERSON>Misitheus</PERSON> had been spent in the profession of letters, not of arms; yet such was the versatile genius of that great man, that, when (A.
D.
 242) he was appointed <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> Praefect, he discharged the military duties of his place with vigour and ability.
 The <NORP>Persians</NORP> had invaded Mesopotamia, and threatened Antioch.
 By the persuasion of his father-in-law, the young emperor quitted the luxury of Rome, opened, for the last time recorded in history, the temple of Janus, and marched in person into the East.
 On his approach with a great army, the <NORP>Persians</NORP> withdrew their garrisons from the cities which they had already taken, and retired from the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> to the Tigris.
 <PERSON>Gordian</PERSON> enjoyed the pleasure of announcing to the senate the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> success of his arms, which he ascribed with a becoming modesty and gratitude to the wisdom of his father and Praefect.
 During the whole expedition, <PERSON>Misitheus</PERSON> watched over the safety and discipline of the army; whilst he prevented their dangerous murmurs by maintaining a regular plenty in the camp, and by establishing ample magazines of vinegar, bacon, straw, barley, and wheat, in all the cities of the frontier.
 (49) But the prosperity of <PERSON>Gordian</PERSON> expired with Misitheus, who died of a flux, not without very strong suspicions of poison.
 A.
D.
 243 Arts of <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> Philip, his successor in the praefecture, was an <NORP>Arab</NORP> by birth, and consequently, in the earlier part of his life, a robber by profession.
 His rise from so obscure a station to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> dignities of the empire, seems to prove that he was a bold and able leader.
 But his boldness prompted him to aspire to the throne, and his abilities were employed to supplant, not to serve, his indulgent master.
 The minds of the soldiers were irritated by an artificial scarcity, created by his contrivance in the camp; and the distress of the army was attributed to the youth and incapacity of the prince.
 It is not in our power to trace the successive steps of the secret conspiracy and open sedition, which were at length fatal to Gordian.
 Murder of <PERSON>Gordian</PERSON> A.
D.
 244, <DATE>March</DATE> A sepulchral monument was erected to his memory on the spot (50) where he was killed, near the conflux of the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> with the little river Aboras.
 (51) The fortunate Philip, raised to the empire by the votes of the soldiers, found a ready obedience from the senate and the provinces.
 (52) Form of a military republic.
 We cannot forbear transcribing the ingenious, though somewhat fanciful description, which a celebrated writer of our own times has traced of the military government of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 According to the historian, whose doubtful narrative the president De Montesquieu has adopted, Philip, who, during the whole transaction, had preserved a sullen silence, was inclined to spare the innocent life of his benefactor; till, recollecting that his innocence might excite a dangerous compassion in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; he commanded, without regard to his suppliant cries, that he should be seized, stript, and led away to instant death.
 After a moment's pause the inhuman sentence was executed.
 (55) Reign of Philip.
 On his return from the <LOC>East</LOC> to Rome, Philip, desirous of obliterating the memory of his crimes, and of captivating the affections of the people, solemnised the secular games with infinite pomp and magnificence.
 Since their institution or revival by Augustus, (56) they had been celebrated by Claudius, by Domitian, and by Severus, and were now renewed the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> time, on the accomplishment of the full period of a thousand years from the foundation of Rome.
 secular games, A.
D.
 248, <DATE>April</DATE> <CARDINAL>21</CARDINAL> Every circumstance of the secular games was skilfully adapted to inspire the superstitious mind with deep and solemn reverence.
 The long interval between them (57) exceeded the term of human life; and as none of the spectators had already seen them, none could flatter themselves with the expectation of beholding them a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time.
 The mystic sacrifices were performed, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> nights, on the banks of the Tiber; and the Campus Martius resounded with music and dances, and was illuminated with innumerable lamps and torches.
 Slaves and strangers were excluded from any participation in these national ceremonies.
 A chorus of <CARDINAL>twenty-seven</CARDINAL> youths, and as many virgins, of noble families, and whose parents were both alive, implored the propitious gods in favour of the present, and for the hope of the rising generation; requesting, in religious hymns, that, according to the faith of their ancient oracles, they would still maintain the virtue, the felicity, and the empire of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 (58) The magnificence of Philip's shows and entertainments dazzled the eyes of the multitude.
 The devout were employed in the rites of superstition, whilst the reflecting few revolved in their anxious minds the past history and the future fate of the empire.
 Decline of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 Since Romulus, with a small band of shepherds and outlaws, fortified himself on the hills near the Tiber, ten centuries had already elapsed.
 (59) During the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> ages, the Romans, in the laborious school of poverty, had acquired the virtues of war and government; by the vigorous exertion of those virtues, and by the assistance of fortune, they had obtained, in the course of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> succeeding centuries, an absolute empire over many countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa.
 The last <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred years had been consumed in apparent prosperity and internal decline.
 The nation of soldiers, magistrates, and legislators, who composed the <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> tribes of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, was dissolved into the common mass of mankind and confounded with the <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of servile provincials, who had received the name without adopting the spirit of Romans.
 A mercenary army, levied among the subjects and barbarians of the frontier, was the only order of men who preserved and abused their independence.
 By their tumultuary election, a Syrian, a Goth, or an Arab, was exalted to the throne of Rome, and invested with despotic power over the conquests and over the country of the Scipios.
 The limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire still extended from the Western Ocean to the Tigris, and from Mount Atlas to the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and the Danube.
 To the undiscerning eye of the vulgar, <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> appeared a monarch no less powerful than <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> or <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> had formerly been.
 The form was still the same, but the animating health and vigour were fled.
 The industry of the people was discouraged and exhausted by a long series of oppression.
 The discipline of the legions, which alone, after the extinction of every other virtue, had propped the greatness of the state, was corrupted by the ambition, or relaxed by the weakness, of the emperors.
 The strength of the frontiers, which had always consisted in arms rather than in fortifications, was insensibly undermined; and the fairest provinces were left exposed to the rapaciousness or ambition of the barbarians, who soon discovered the decline of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
