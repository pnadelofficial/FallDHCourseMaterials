Final Destruction of Paganism.
 Introduction of the Worship of Saints and Relics among the ChristiansThe destruction of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> religion, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>378-395</CARDINAL> THE ruin of Paganism, in the age of Theodosius, is perhaps the only example of the total extirpation of any ancient and popular superstition, and may therefore deserve to be considered as a singular event in the history of the human mind.
 The Christians, more especially the clergy, had impatiently supported the prudent delays of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and the equal toleration of the elder Valentinian; nor could they deem their conquest perfect or secure as long as their adversaries were permitted to exist.
 The influence which <PERSON>Ambrose</PERSON> and his brethren had acquired over the youth of <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> and the piety of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> was employed to infuse the maxims of persecution into the breasts of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> proselytes.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> specious principles of religious jurisprudence were established, from whence they deduced a direct and rigorous conclusion against the subjects of the empire who still adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors: that the magistrate is, in some measure, guilty of the crimes which he neglects to prohibit or to punish; and that the idolatrous worship of fabulous deities and real daemons is the most abominable crime against the supreme majesty of the Creator.
 The laws of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and the examples of <NORP>Jewish</NORP> history (1) were hastily, perhaps erroneously, applied by the clergy to the mild and universal reign of Christianity.
(2) The zeal of the emperors was excited to vindicate their own honour and that of the Deity; and the temples of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world were subverted about sixty years after the conversion of Constantine.
 State of <NORP>Paganism</NORP> in <GPE>Rome</GPE> From the age of <NORP>Numa</NORP> to the reign of Gratian, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> preserved the regular succession of the several colleges of the sacerdotal order.
 (3) <CARDINAL>Fifteen</CARDINAL> PONTIFFs exercised their supreme jurisdiction over all things and persons that were consecrated to the service of the gods; and the various questions which perpetually arose in a loose and traditionary system were submitted to the judgment of their holy tribunal.
 <CARDINAL>Fifteen</CARDINAL> grave and learned AUGURS observed the face of the heavens, and prescribed the actions of heroes according to the flight of birds.
 <CARDINAL>Fifteen</CARDINAL> keepers of the <NORP>Sibylline</NORP> books (their name of <ORG>QUINDECEMVIRS</ORG> was derived from their number) occasionally consulted the history of future, and, as it should seem, of contingent events.
 <CARDINAL>Six</CARDINAL> VESTALS devoted their virginity to the guard of the sacred fire and of the unknown pledges of the duration of Rome, which no mortal had been suffered to behold with impunity.
(4) <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> EPULOS prepared the table of the gods, conducted the solemn procession, and regulated the ceremonies of the <DATE>annual</DATE> festival.
 The <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> FLAMENS of Jupiter, of Mars, and of Quirinus, were considered as the peculiar ministers of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> most powerful deities, who watched over the fate of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of the universe.
 The KING of the SACRIFICES represented the person of <NORP>Numa</NORP> and of his successors in the religious functions, which could be performed only by royal hands.
 The confraternities of the SALIANS, the LUPERCALS, etc.
, practised such rites as might extort a smile of contempt from every reasonable man, with a lively confidence of recommending themselves to the favour of the immortal gods.
 The authority which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> priests had formerly obtained in the counsels of the republic was gradually abolished by the establishment of monarchy and the removal of the seat of empire.
 But the dignity of their sacred character was still protected by the laws and manners of their country; and they still continued, more especially the college of pontiffs, to exercise in the capital, and sometimes in the provinces, the rights of their ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction.
 Their robes of purple, chariots of state, and sumptuous entertainments attracted the admiration of the people; and they received, from the consecrated lands and the public revenue, an ample stipend, which liberally supported the splendour of the priesthood and all the expenses of the religious worship of the state.
 As the service of the altar was not incompatible with the command of armies, the Romans, after their consulships and triumphs, aspired to the place of pontiff or of augur; the seats of Cicero(5) and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> were filled, in the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> century, by the most illustrious members of the senate; and the dignity of their birth reflected additional splendour on their sacerdotal character.
 The <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> priests who composed the college of pontiffs enjoyed a more distinguished rank as the companions of their sovereign; and the <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperors condescended to accept the robe and ensigns which were appropriated to the office of supreme pontiff.
 But when <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> ascended the throne, more scrupulous or more enlightened, he sternly rejected those profane symbols;(6) applied to the service of the state or of the church the revenues of the priests and vestals; abolished their honours and immunities; and dissolved the ancient fabric of <NORP>Roman</NORP> superstition, which was supported by the opinions and habits of eleven hundred years.
 <NORP>Paganism</NORP> was still the constitutional religion of the senate.
 The hall or temple in which they assembled was adorned by the statue and altar of Victory;(7) a majestic female standing on a globe, with flowing garments, expanded wings, and a crown of laurel in her outstretched hand.
 (8) The senators were sworn on the altar of the goddess to observe the laws of the emperor and of the empire; and a solemn offering of wine and incense was the ordinary prelude of their public deliberations.
(9) The removal of this ancient monument was the only injury which <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> had offered to the superstition of the Romans.
 The altar of <PERSON>Victory</PERSON> was again restored by Julian, tolerated by Valentinian, and once more banished from the senate by the zeal of Gratian.
(10) But the emperor yet spared the statues of the gods which were exposed to the public veneration: <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred and twenty-four temples, or chapels, still remained to satisfy the devotion of the people, and in every quarter of <GPE>Rome</GPE> the delicacy of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> was offended by the fumes of idolatrous sacrifice.
(11) Petition of the senate for the altar of Victory.
 A.
D.
 384 But the <NORP>Christians</NORP> formed the least numerous party in the senate of Rome; (12) and it was only by their absence that they could express their dissent from the legal, though profane, acts of a <NORP>Pagan</NORP> majority.
 In that assembly the dying embers of freedom were, for a moment, revived and inflamed by the breath of fanaticism.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> respectable deputations were successively voted to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court, (13) to represent the grievances of the priesthood and the senate, and to solicit the restoration of the altar of Victory.
 The conduct of this important business was intrusted to the eloquent Symmachus,(14) a wealthy and noble senator, who united the sacred characters of pontiff and augur with the civil dignities of proconsul of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and praefect of the city.
 The breast of <PERSON>Symmachus</PERSON> was animated by the warmest zeal for the cause of expiring Paganism; and his religious antagonists lamented the abuse of his genius and the inefficacy of his moral virtues.
 (15) The orator, whose petition is extant to the emperor Valentinian, was conscious of the difficulty and danger of the office which he had assumed.
 He cautiously avoids every topic which might appear to reflect on the religion of his sovereign; humbly declares that prayers and entreaties are his only arms; and artfully draws his arguments from the schools of rhetoric rather than from those of philosophy.
 <PERSON>Symmachus</PERSON> endeavours to seduce the imagination of a young prince, by displaying the attributes of the goddess of Victory; he insinuates that the confiscation of the revenues which were consecrated to the service of the gods was a measure unworthy of his liberal and disinterested character; and maintains that the <NORP>Roman</NORP> sacrifices would be deprived of their force and energy, if they were no longer celebrated at the expense as well as in the name of the republic.
 Even scepticism is made to supply an apology for superstition.
 The great and incomprehensible secret of the universe eludes the inquiry of man.
 Where reason cannot instruct, custom may be permitted to guide; and every nation seems to consult the dictates of prudence, by a faithful attachment to those rites and opinions which have received the sanction of ages.
 If those ages have been crowned with glory and prosperity - if the devout people has frequently obtained the blessings which they have solicited at the altars of the gods it must appear still more advisable to persist in the same salutary practice, and not to risk the unknown perils that may attend any rash innovations.
 The test of antiquity and success was applied with singular advantage to the religion of Numa; and <PERSON>ROME</PERSON> herself, the celestial genius that presided over the fates of the city, is introduced by the orator to plead her own cause before the tribunal of the emperors.
 The fears of the people supplied what the discretion of the orator had suppressed, and the calamities which afflicted or threatened the declining empire were unanimously imputed by the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> to the new religion of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and of Constantine.
 Conversion of Rome, A.
D.
 388, etc.
 But the hopes of <PERSON>Symmachus</PERSON> were repeatedly baffled by the firm and dexterous opposition of the archbishop of Milan, who fortified the emperors against the fallacious eloquence of the advocate of Rome.
 In this controversy Ambrose, condescends to speak the language of a philosopher, and to ask; with some contempt, why it should be thought necessary to introduce an imaginary and invisible power as the cause of those victories, which were sufficiently explained by the valour and discipline of the legions.
 He justly derides the absurd reverence for antiquity, which could only tend to discourage the :improvements of art and to replunge the human race into their original barbarism.
 From thence gradually rising to a more lofty and theological tone, he pronounces that <NORP>Christianity</NORP> alone is the doctrine of truth and salvation, and that :every mode of <PERSON>Polytheism</PERSON> conducts its deluded votaries through the paths of error to the abyss of eternal perdition.
 (17) Arguments like these, when they were suggested by a favourite bishop, had power to prevent the restoration of the altar of Victory; but the same arguments fell with much more energy and effect from the mouth of a conqueror, and the gods of antiquity were dragged in triumph at the chariot-wheels of Theodosius.
(18) In a full meeting of the senate the emperor proposed, according to the forms of the republic, the important question, whether the worship of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> or that of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> should be the religion of the Romans? The liberty of suffrages, which he affected to allow, was destroyed by the hopes and fears that his presence inspired; and the arbitrary exile of <PERSON>Symmachus</PERSON> was a recent admonition that it might be dangerous to oppose the wishes of the monarch.
 On a regular division of the senate, <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> was condemned and degraded by the sense of a very large majority; and it is rather surprising that any members should be found bold enough to declare, by their speeches and votes, that they were still attached to the interest of an abdicated deity.
 (19) The hasty conversion of the senate must be attributed either to supernatural or to sordid motives; and many of these reluctant proselytes betrayed, on every favourable occasion, their secret disposition to throw aside the mask of odious dissimulation.
 But they were gradually fixed in the new religion, as the cause of the ancient became more hopeless; they yielded to the authority of the emperor, to the fashion of the times, and to the entreaties of their wives and children, (20) who were instigated and governed by the clergy of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the monks of the East.
 The edifying example of the <PERSON>Anician</PERSON> family was soon imitated by the rest of the nobility: the Bassi, the Paullini, the Gracchi, embraced the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion; andThe citizens, who subsisted by their own industry, and the populace, who were supported by the public liberality, filled the churches of the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> and <FAC>Vatican</FAC> with an incessant throng of devout proselytes.
 The decrees of the senate, which proscribed the worship of idols, were ratified by the general consent of the Romans;(22) the splendour of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> was defaced, and the solitary temples were abandoned to ruin and contempt.
 (23) <GPE>Rome</GPE> submitted to the yoke of the Gospel; and the vanquished provinces had not yet lost their reverence for the name and authority of Rome.
 Destruction of the temples in the provinces, A.
D.
 381 etc The filial piety of the emperors themselves engaged them to proceed with some caution and tenderness in the reformation of the eternal city.
 Those absolute monarchs acted with less regard to the prejudices of the provincials.
 The pious labour, which had been suspended near twenty years since the death of Constantius,(24) was vigorously resumed, and finally accomplished, by the zeal of Theodosius.
 Whilst that warlike prince yet struggled with the Goths, not for the glory, but for the safety of the republic, he ventured to offend a considerable party of his subjects, by some acts which might perhaps secure the protection of Heaven, but which must seem rash and unseasonable in the eye of human prudence.
 The success of his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> experiments against the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> encouraged the pious emperor to reiterate and enforce his edicts of proscription: the same laws which had been originally published in the provinces of the East, were applied, after the defeat of Maximus, to the whole extent of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire; and every victory of the orthodox <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> contributed to the triumph of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> and catholic faith.
(25) He attacked superstition in her most vital part, by prohibiting the use of sacrifices, which he declared to be criminal as well as infamous; and if the terms of his edicts more strictly condemned the impious curiosity which examined the entrails of the victims,(26) every subsequent explanation tended to involve in the same guilt the general practice of immolation which essentially constituted the religion of the Pagans.
 As the temples had been erected for the purpose of sacrifice, it was the duty of a benevolent prince to remove from his subjects the dangerous temptation of offending against the laws which he had enacted.
 A special commission was granted to Cynegius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of the East, and afterwards to the counts <PERSON>Jovius</PERSON> and Gaudentius, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> officers of distinguished rank in the West, by which they were directed to shut the temples, to seize or destroy the instruments of idolatry, to abolish the privileges of the priests, and to confiscate the consecrated property for the benefit of the emperor, of the church, or of the army.
 (27) Here the desolation might have stopped: and the naked edifices, which were no longer employed in the service of idolatry, might have been protected from the destructive rage of fanaticism.
 Many of those temples were the most splendid and beautiful monuments of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> architecture: and the emperor himself was interested not to deface the splendour of his own cities, or to diminish the value of his own possessions: Those stately edifices might be suffered to remain, as so many lasting trophies of the victory of Christ.
 In the decline of the arts, they might be usefully converted into magazines, manufactures, or places of public assembly: and perhaps, when the walls of the temple had been sufficiently purified by holy rites, the worship of the true Deity might be allowed to expiate the ancient guilt of idolatry.
 But as long as they subsisted, the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> fondly cherished the secret hope that an auspicious revolution, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Julian, might again restore the altars of the gods: and the earnestness with which they addressed their unavailing prayers to the throne(28) increased the zeal of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> reformers to extirpate, without mercy, the root of superstition.
 The laws of the emperors exhibit some symptoms of a milder disposition: (29) but their cold and languid efforts were insufficient to stem the torrent of enthusiasm and rapine, which was conducted, or rather impelled, by the spiritual rulers of the church.
 In Gaul, the holy Martin, bishop of Tours, (30) marched at the head of his faithful monks to destroy the idols, the temples, and the consecrated trees of his extensive diocese; and, in the execution of this arduous task, the prudent reader will judge whether <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> was supported by the aid of miraculous powers or of carnal weapons.
 In Syria, the divine and excellent Marcellus, (31) as he is styled by Theodoret, a bishop animated with apostolic fervour, resolved to level with the ground the stately temples within the diocese of Apamea.
 His attack was resisted by the skill and solidity with which the temple of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> had been constructed.
 The building was seated on an eminence: on each of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> sides the lofty roof was supported by <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> massy columns, sixteen feet in circumference; and the large stones of which they were composed were firmly cemented with lead and iron.
 The force of the strongest and sharpest tools had been tried without effect.
 It was found necessary to undermine the foundations of the columns, which fell down as soon as the temporary wooden props had been consumed with fire; and the difficulties of the enterprise are described under the allegory of a black daemon, who retarded, though he could not defeat, the operations of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> engineers.
 Elated with victory, <PERSON>Marcellus</PERSON> took the field in person against the powers of darkness; a numerous troop of soldiers and gladiators marched under the episcopal banner, and he successively attacked the villages and country temples of the diocese of Apamea.
 Whenever any resistance or danger was apprehended, the champion of the faith, whose lameness would not allow him either to fight or fly, placed himself at a convenient distance, beyond the reach of darts.
 But this prudence was the occasion of his death; he was surprised and slain by a body of exasperated rustics; and the synod of the province pronounced, without hesitation, that the holy <PERSON>Marcellus</PERSON> had sacrificed his life in the cause of God.
 In the support of this cause, the monks, who rushed with tumultuous fury from the desert, distinguished themselves by their zeal and diligence.
 They deserved the enmity of the Pagans; and some of them might deserve the reproaches of avarice and intemperance, which they indulged at the expense of the people, who foolishly admired their tattered garments, loud psalmody, and artificial paleness.
(32) A small number of temples was protected by the fears, the venality, the taste, or the prudence of the civil and ecclesiastical governors.
 The temple of the Celestial Venus at Carthage, whose sacred precincts formed a circumference of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles, was judiciously converted into a <NORP>Christian</NORP> church;(33) and a similar consecration had preserved inviolate the majestic dome of the <FAC>Pantheon</FAC> at Rome.
 (34) But in almost every province of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, an army of fanatics, without authority and without discipline, invaded the peaceful inhabitants; and the ruin of the fairest structures of antiquity still displays the ravages of those barbarians who alone had time and inclination to execute such laborious destruction.
 The temple of <PERSON>Serapis</PERSON> at <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> In this wide and various prospect of devastation, the spectator may distinguish the ruins of the temple of Serapis, at Alexandria.
 (35) <PERSON>Serapis</PERSON> does not appear to have been one of the native gods, or monsters, who sprung from the fruitful soil of superstitious Egypt.
(36) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Ptolemies</NORP> had been commanded, by a dream, to import the mysterious stranger from the coast of Pontus, where he had been long adored by the inhabitants of Sinope; but his attributes and his reign were so imperfectly understood, that it became a subject of dispute whether he represented the bright orb of day, or the gloomy monarch of the subterraneous regions.
 (37) The Egyptians, who were obstinately devoted to the religion of their fathers, refused to admit this foreign deity within the walls of their cities.
(38) But the obsequious priests, who were seduced by the liberality of the Ptolemies, submitted, without resistance, to the power of the god of Pontus: an honourable and domestic genealogy was provided; and this fortunate usurper was introduced into the throne and bed of Osiris,(39) the husband of Isis, and the celestial monarch of Egypt.
 Alexandria, which claimed his peculiar protection, gloried in the name of the city of Serapis.
 His temple,(40) which rivalled the pride and magnificence of the Capitol, was erected on the spacious summit of an artificial mount, raised one hundred steps above the level of the adjacent parts of the city, and the interior cavity was strongly supported by arches, and distributed into vaults and subterraneous apartments.
 The consecrated buildings were surrounded by a quadrangular portico; the stately halls and exquisite statues displayed the triumph of the arts; and the treasures of ancient learning were preserved in the famous <NORP>Alexandrian</NORP> library, which had arisen with new splendour from its ashes.
 (41) After the edicts of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> had severely prohibited the sacrifices of the Pagans, they were still tolerated in the city and temple of Serapis; and this singular indulgence was imprudently ascribed to the superstitious terrors of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> themselves: as if they had feared to abolish those ancient rites which could alone secure the inundations of the Nile, the harvests of Egypt, and the subsistence of Constantinople.
(42) Its final destruction, A.
D.
 389 At that time (43) the archiepiscopal throne of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> was filled by Theophilus, (44) the perpetual enemy of peace and virtue; a bold, bad man, whose hands were alternately polluted with gold and with blood.
 His pious indignation was excited by the honours of Serapis; and the insults which he offered to an ancient chapel of <PERSON>Bacchus</PERSON> convinced the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> that he meditated a more important and dangerous enterprise.
 In the tumultuous capital of Egypt, the slightest provocation was sufficient to inflame a civil war.
 The votaries of Serapis, whose strength and numbers were much inferior to those of their antagonists, rose in arms at the instigation of the philosopher Olympius, (45) who exhorted them to die in the defence of the altars of the gods.
 These <NORP>Pagan</NORP> fanatics fortified themselves in the temple, or rather fortress, of Serapis; repelled the besiegers by daring sallies and a resolute defence; and, by the inhuman cruelties which they exercised on their <NORP>Christian</NORP> prisoners, obtained the last consolation of despair.
 The efforts of the prudent magistrate were usefully exerted for the establishment of a truce till the answer of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> should determine the fate of Serapis.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> parties assembled without arms, in the principal square; and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> rescript was publicly read.
 But when a sentence of destruction against the idols of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> was pronounced, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> sent up a shout of joy and exultation, whilst the unfortunate Pagans, whose fury had given way to consternation, retired with hasty and silent steps, and eluded, by their flight or obscurity, the resentment of their enemies.
 <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> proceeded to demolish the temple of Serapis, without any other difficulties than those which he found in the weight and solidity of the materials, but these obstacles proved so insuperable that he was obliged to leave the foundations, and to content himself with reducing the edifice itself to a heap of rubbish, a part of which was soon afterwards cleared away, to make room for a church erected in honour of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> martyrs.
 The valuable library of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> was pillaged or destroyed; and near twenty years afterwards, the appearance of the empty shelves excited the regret and indignation of every spectator whose mind was not totally darkened by religious prejudice.
(46) The compositions of ancient genius, so many of which have irretrievably perished, might surely have been excepted from the wreck of idolatry, for the amusement and instruction of succeeding ages; and either the zeal or the avarice of the archbishop(47) might have been satiated with the rich spoils which were the reward of his victory.
 While the images and vases of gold and silver were carefully melted, and those of a less valuable metal were contemptuously broken and cast into the streets, <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> laboured to expose the frauds and vices of the ministers of the idols: their dexterity in the management of the loadstone; their secret methods of introducing an human actor into a hollow statue; and their scandalous abuse of the confidence of devout husbands and unsuspecting females.
(48) Charges like these may seem to deserve some degree of credit, as they are not repugnant to the crafty and interested spirit of superstition.
 But the same spirit is equally prone to the base practice of insulting and calumniating a fallen enemy; and our belief is naturally checked by the reflection that it is much less difficult to invent a fictitious story than to support a practical fraud.
 The colossal statue of <PERSON>Serapis</PERSON> (49) was involved in the ruin of his temple and religion.
 A great number of plates of different metals, artificially joined together, composed the majestic figure of the deity, who touched on either side the walls of the sanctuary.
 The aspect of Serapis, his sitting posture, and the sceptre which he bore in his left hand, were extremely similar to the ordinary representations of Jupiter.
 He was distinguished from <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> by the basket, or bushel, which was placed on his head; and by the emblematic monster which he held in his right hand; the head and body of a serpent branching into <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> tails, which were again terminated by the triple heads of a dog, a lion, and a wolf.
 It was confidently affirmed that, if any impious hand should dare to violate the majesty of the god, the heavens and the earth would instantly return to their original chaos.
 An intrepid soldier, animated by zeal, and armed with a weighty battle-axe, ascended the ladder; and even the <NORP>Christian</NORP> multitude expected with some anxiety the event of the combat.
(50) He aimed a vigorous stroke against the cheek of Serapis; the cheek fell to the ground; the thunder was still silent, and both the heavens and the earth continued to preserve their accustomed order and tranquillity.
 The victorious soldier repeated his blows: the huge idol was overthrown and broken in pieces; and the limbs of <PERSON>Serapis</PERSON> were ignominiously dragged through the streets of Alexandria.
 His mangled carcase was burnt in the amphitheatre, amidst the shouts of the populace; and many persons attributed their conversion to this discovery of the impotence of their tutelar deity.
 The popular modes of religion, that propose any visible and material objects of worship, have the advantage of adapting and familiarising themselves to the senses of mankind; but this advantage is counterbalanced by the various and inevitable accidents to which the faith of the idolater is exposed.
 It is scarcely possible that, in every disposition of mind, he should preserve his implicit reverence for the idols, or the relics, which the naked eye and the profane hand are unable to distinguish from the most common productions of art or nature; and, if, in the hour of danger, their secret and miraculous virtue does not operate for their own preservation, he scorns the vain apologies of his priests, and justly derides the object and the folly of his superstitious attachment.
(51) After the fall of Serapis, some hopes were still entertained by the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> that the <LOC>Nile</LOC> would refuse his <DATE>annual</DATE> supply to the pious masters of Egypt; and the extraordinary delay of the inundation seemed to announce the displeasure of the river-god.
 But this delay was soon compensated by the rapid swell of the waters.
 They suddenly rose to such an unusual height as to comfort the discontented party with the pleasing expectation of a deluge; till the peaceful river again subsided to the well-known and fertilising level of sixteen cubits, or about thirty English feet(52) The <NORP>Pagan</NORP> religion is prohibited, A.
D.
 390.
 The temples of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire were deserted or destroyed; but the ingenious superstition of the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> still attempted to elude the laws of Theodosius, by which all sacrifices had been severely prohibited.
 The inhabitants of the country, whose conduct was less exposed to the eye of malicious curiosity, disguised their religious under the appearance of convivial meetings.
 On the days of solemn festivals they assembled in great numbers under the spreading shade of some consecrated trees; sheep and oxen were slaughtered and roasted; and this rural entertainment was sanctified by the use of incense and by the hymns which were sung in honour of the gods.
 But it was alleged that, as no part of the animal was made a burnt-offering, as no altar was provided to receive the blood, and as the previous oblation of salt cakes and the concluding ceremony of libations were carefully omitted, these festal meetings did not involve the guests in the guilt or penalty of an illegal sacrifice.
(53) Whatever might be the truth of the facts or the merit of the distinction,(54) these vain pretences were swept away by the last edict of Theodosius, which inflicted a deadly wound on the superstition of the Pagans.
 (55) This prohibitory law is expressed in the most absolute and comprehensive terms.
 The act of sacrificing and the practice of divination by the entrails of the victim are declared (without any regard to the object of the inquiry) a crime of high treason against the state, which can be expiated only by the death of the guilty.
 The rites of <NORP>Pagan</NORP> superstition which might seem less bloody and atrocious are abolished as highly injurious to the truth and honour of religion; luminaries, garlands, frankincense, and libations of wine are specially enumerated and condemned; and the harmless claims of the domestic genius, of the household gods, are included in this rigorous proscription.
 The use of any of these profane and illegal ceremonies subjects the offender to the forfeiture of the house or estate where they have been performed; and if he has artfully chosen the property of another for the scene of his impiety, he is compelled to discharge, without delay, a heavy fine of twenty-five pounds of gold, or more than one thousand pounds sterling.
 A fine not less considerable is imposed on the connivance of the secret enemies of religion who shall neglect the duty of their respective stations, either to reveal or to punish the guilt of idolatry.
 Such was the persecuting spirit of the laws of Theodosius, which were repeatedly enforced by his sons and grandsons, with the loud and unanimous applause of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world.
(56) Oppressed, In the cruel reigns of <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> and Diocletian <NORP>Christianity</NORP> had been proscribed, as a revolt from the ancient and hereditary religion of the empire; and the unjust suspicions which were entertained of a dark and dangerous faction were in some measure countenanced by the inseparable union and rapid conquests of the catholic church.
 But the same excuses of fear and ignorance cannot be applied to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperors, who violated the precepts of humanity and of the Gospel.
 The experience of ages had betrayed the weakness as well as folly of Paganism; the light of reason and of faith had already exposed to the greatest part of mankind the vanity of idols; and the declining sect, which still adhered to their worship, might have been permitted to enjoy in peace and obscurity the religious customs of their ancestors.
 Had the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> been animated by the undaunted zeal which possessed the minds of the primitive believers, the triumph of the church must have been stained with blood; and the martyrs of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> and <LOC>Apollo</LOC> might have embraced the glorious opportunity of devoting their lives and fortunes at the foot of their altars.
 But such obstinate zeal was not congenial to the loose and careless temper of Polytheism.
 The violent and repeated strokes of the orthodox princes were broken by the soft and yielding substance against which they were directed; and the ready obedience of the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> protected them from the pains and penalties of the Theodosian Code.
 (57) Instead of asserting that the authority of the gods was superior to that of the emperor, they desisted, with a plaintive murmur, from the use of those sacred rites which their sovereign had condemned.
 If they were sometimes tempted by a sally of passion, or by the hopes of concealment, to indulge their favourite superstition, their humble repentance disarmed the severity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> magistrate, and they seldom refused to atone for their rashness by submitting, with some secret reluctance, to the yoke of the Gospel.
 The churches were filled with the increasing multitude of these unworthy proselytes, who had conformed, from temporal motives, to the reigning religion; and whilst they devoutly imitated the postures and recited the prayers of the faithful, they satisfied their conscience by the silent and sincere invocation of the gods of antiquity.
(58) If the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> wanted patience to suffer, they wanted spirit to resist; and the scattered myriads, who deplored the ruin of the temples, yielded, without a contest, to the fortune of their adversaries.
 The disorderly opposition(59) of the peasants of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and the populace of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> to the rage of private fanaticism was silenced by the name and authority of the emperor.
 The <NORP>Pagans</NORP> of the West, without contributing to the elevation of Eugenius, disgraced by their partial attachment the cause and character of the usurper.
 The clergy vehemently exclaimed that he aggravated the crime of rebellion by the guilt of apostasy; that, by his permission, the altar of <PERSON>Victory</PERSON> was again restored; and that the idolatrous symbols of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> and <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> were displayed in the field against the invincible standard of the cross.
 But the vain hopes of the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> were soon annihilated by the defeat of Eugenius; and they were left exposed to the resentment of the conqueror, who laboured to deserve the favour of Heaven by the extirpation of idolatry.

 390-420 etc A nation of slaves is always prepared to applaud the clemency of their master who, in the abuse of absolute power, does not proceed to the last extremes of injustice and oppression.
 <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> might undoubtedly have proposed to his <NORP>Pagan</NORP> subjects the alternative of baptism or of death; and the eloquent <PERSON>Libanius</PERSON> has praised the moderation of a prince who never enacted, by any positive law, that all his subjects should immediately embrace and practise the religion of their sovereign.
 (61) The profession of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was not made an essential qualification for the enjoyment of the civil rights of society, nor were any peculiar hardships imposed on the sectaries who credulously received the fables of <PERSON>Ovid</PERSON> and obstinately rejected the miracles of the Gospel.
 The palace, the schools, the army, and the senate were filled with declared and devout Pagans; they obtained, without distinction, the civil and military honours of the empire.
 <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> distinguished his liberal regard for virtue and genius by the consular dignity which he bestowed on Symmachus,(62) and by the personal friendship which he expressed to Libanius; (63) and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> eloquent apologists of <NORP>Paganism</NORP> were never required either to change or to dissemble their religious opinions.
 The <NORP>Pagans</NORP> were indulged in the most licentious freedom of speech and writing; the historical and philosophic remains of Eunapius, Zosimus,(64) and the fanatic teachers of the school of Plato, betray the most furious animosity, and contain the sharpest invectives, against the sentiment and conduct of their victorious adversaries.
 If these audacious libels were publicly known, we must applaud the good sense of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes, who viewed with a smile of contempt the last struggles of superstition and despair.
 (65) But the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> laws which prohibited the sacrifices and ceremonies of <NORP>Paganism</NORP> were rigidly executed; and every hour contributed to destroy the influence of a religion which was supported by custom rather than by argument.
 The devotion of the poet or the philosopher may be secretly nourished by prayer, meditation, and study; but the exercise of public worship appears to be the only solid foundation of the religious sentiments of the people, which derive their force from imitation and habit.
 The interruption of that public exercise may consummate, in the period of a few years, the important work of a national revolution.
 The memory of theological opinions cannot long be preserved without the artificial helps of priests, of temples, and of books.
(66) The ignorant vulgar, whose minds are still agitated by the blind hopes and terrors of superstition, will be soon persuaded by their superiors to direct their vows to the reigning deities of the age; and will insensibly imbibe an ardent zeal for the support and propagation of the new doctrine, which spiritual hunger at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> compelled them to accept.
 The generation that arose in the world after the promulgation of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> laws was attracted within the pale of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church: and so rapid, yet so gentle, was the fall of Paganism, that only twenty-eight years after the death of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> the faint and minute vestiges were no longer visible to the eye of the legislator.
(67) The worship of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> martyrs The ruin of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> religion is described by the sophists as a dreadful and amazing prodigy, which covered the earth with darkness and restored the ancient dominion of chaos and of night.
 They relate in solemn and pathetic strains; that the temples were converted into sepulchres, and that the holy places, which had been adorned by the statues of the gods, were basely polluted by the relics of <NORP>Christian</NORP> martyrs.
 Without approving the malice, it is natural enough to share the surprise of the sophist, the spectator of a revolution which raised those obscure victims of the laws of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the rank of celestial and invisible protectors of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The grateful respect of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> for the martyrs of the faith was exalted, by time and victory, into religious adoration; and the most illustrious of the saints and prophets were deservedly associated to the honours of the martyrs.
 One hundred and fifty years after the glorious deaths of St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul, the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the Ostian road were distinguished by the tombs, or rather by the trophies, of those; spiritual heroes.
(69) In the age which followed the conversion of Constantine, the emperors, the consuls, and the generals of armies devoutly visited the sepulchres of a tent-maker and a fisherman;(70) and their venerable bones were deposited under the altars of Christ, on which the bishops of the royal city continually offered the unbloody sacrifice.
 (71) The new capital of the Eastern world, unable to produce any ancient and domestic trophies, was enriched by the spoils of dependent provinces.
 The bodies of St.
 Andrew, St.
 Luke, and St.
 Timothy had reposed near <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred years in the obscure graves from whence they were transported, in solemn pomp, to the church of the apostles, which the magnificence of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had founded on the banks of the Thracian Bosphorus.
(72) About fifty years afterwards the same banks were honoured by the presence of Samuel, the judge and prophet of the people of Israel.
 His ashes, deposited in a golden vase, and covered with a silken veil, were delivered by the bishops into each other's hands.
 The relics of <PERSON>Samuel</PERSON> were received by the people with the same joy and reverence which they would have shown to the living prophet; the highways, from <GPE>Palestine</GPE> to the gates of Constantinople, were filled with an uninterrupted procession; and the emperor <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> himself, at the head of the most illustrious members of the clergy and senate, advanced to meet his extraordinary guest, who had always deserved and claimed the homage of kings.
 (73) The example of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> confirmed the faith and discipline of the catholic world.
 The honours of the saints and martyrs, after a feeble and ineffectual murmur of profane reason,(74) were universally established; and in the age of <PERSON>Ambrose</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jerome</PERSON> something was still deemed wanting to the sanctity of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> church, till it had been consecrated by some portion of holy relics, which fixed and inflamed the devotion of the faithful.
 General Reflections In the long period of twelve hundred years, which elapsed between the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and the reformation of Luther, the worship of saints and relics corrupted the pure and perfect simplicity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> model; and some symptoms of degeneracy may be observed even in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> generations which adopted and cherished this pernicious innovation.
 <CARDINAL>1</CARDINAL> Fabulous martyrs and relics.
 1.
 The satisfactory experience that the relics of saints were more valuable than gold or precious stones (75) stimulated the clergy to multiply the treasures of the church.
 Without much regard for truth or probability, they invented names for skeletons, and actions for names.
 The fame of the apostles, and of the holy men who had imitated their virtues, was darkened by religious fiction.
 To the invincible band of genuine and primitive martyrs they added myriads of imaginary heroes, who had never existed, except in the fancy of crafty or credulous legendaries; and there is reason to suspect that <WORK_OF_ART>Tours</WORK_OF_ART> might not be the only diocese in which the bones of a malefactor were adored instead of those of a saint.
(76) A superstitious practice, which tended to increase the temptations of fraud and credulity, insensibly extinguished the light of history and of reason in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world.
 <CARDINAL>2</CARDINAL> Miracles 2.
 But the progress of superstition would have been much less rapid and victorious if the faith of the people had not been assisted by the seasonable aid of visions and miracles to ascertain the authenticity and virtue of the most suspicious relics.
 In the reign of the younger Theodosius, Lucian,(77) a presbyter of Jerusalem, and the ecclesiastical minister of the village of Caphargamala, about twenty miles from the city, related a very singular dream, which, to remove his doubts, had been repeated on <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> successive Saturdays.
 A venerable figure stood before him, in the silence of the night, with a long beard, a white robe, and a gold rod; announced himself by the name of Gamaliel; and revealed to the astonished presbyter, that his own corpse, with the bodies of his son Abibas, his friend Nicodemus, and the illustrious Stephen, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> martyr of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith, were secretly buried in the adjacent field.
 He added, with some impatience, that it was time to release himself and his companions from their obscure prison; that their appearance would be salutary to a distressed world; and that they had made choice of <PERSON>Lucian</PERSON> to inform the bishop of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> of their situation and their wishes.
 The doubts and difficulties which still retarded this important discovery were successively removed by new visions; and the ground was opened by the bishop in the presence of an innumerable multitude; The coffins of Gamaliel, of his son, and of his friend, were found in regular order; but when the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> coffin, which contained the remains of Stephen, was shown to the light, the earth trembled, and an odour such as that of <LOC>Paradise</LOC> was smelt, which instantly cured the various diseases of <CARDINAL>seventy-three</CARDINAL> of the assistants.
 The companions of <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> were left in their peaceful residence of Caphargamala; but the relics of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> martyr were transported, in solemn procession, to a church constructed in their honour on Mount Sion; and the minute particles of those relics, a drop of blood, (78) or the scrapings of a bone, were acknowledged, in almost every province of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, to possess a divine and miraculous virtue.
 The grave and learned Augustin,(79) whose understanding scarcely admits the excuse of credulity, has attested the innumerable prodigies which were performed in <LOC>Africa</LOC> by the relics of St.
 Stephen; and this marvellous narrative is inserted in the elaborate work of the City of God, which the bishop of <PERSON>Hippo</PERSON> designed as a solid and immortal proof of the truth of Christianity.
 <PERSON>Augustin</PERSON> solemnly declares that he has selected those miracles only which were publicly certified by the persons who were either the objects, or the spectators, of the power of the martyr.
 Many prodigies were omitted or forgotten; and <PERSON>Hippo</PERSON> had been less favourably treated than the other cities of the province.
 And yet the bishop enumerates above <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> miracles, of which <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> were resurrections from the dead, in the space of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years, and within the limits of his own diocese.
(80) If we enlarge our view to all the diocese, and all the saints, of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world, it will not be easy to calculate the fables, and the errors, which issued from this inexhaustible source.
 But we may surely be allowed to observe that a miracle, in that age of superstition and credulity, lost its name and its merit, since it could scarcely be considered as a deviation from the ordinary and established: laws of nature.
 <CARDINAL>3</CARDINAL> Revival of polytheism.
 3.
 The innumerable miracles, of which the tombs of the martyrs were the perpetual theatre, revealed to the pious believer the actual state and constitution of the invisible world; and his religious speculations appeared to be founded on the firm basis of fact and experience.
 What ever might be the condition of vulgar souls in the long interval between the dissolution and the resurrection of their bodies, it was evident.
 that the superior spirits of the saints and martyrs did not consume that portion of their existence in silent and inglorious sleep.
 (81) It was evident (without presuming to determine the place of their habitation, or the nature of their felicity) that they enjoyed the lively and active consciousness of their happiness, their virtue, and their powers; and that they had already secured the possession of their eternal reward.
 The enlargement of their intellectual faculties surpassed the measure of the human imagination; since it was proved by experience that they were capable of hearing and understanding the various petitions of their numerous votaries, who, in the same moment of time, but in the most distant parts of the world, invoked the name and assistance of <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> or of Martin.
 (82) The confidence of their petitioners was founded on the persuasion that the saints, who reigned with Christ, cast an eye of pity upon earth; that they were warmly interested in the prosperity of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church; and that the individuals who imitated the example of their faith and piety were the peculiar and favourite objects of their most tender regard.
 Sometimes, indeed, their friendship might be influenced by considerations of a less exalted kind: they viewed with partial affection the places which had been consecrated by their birth, their residence, their death, their burial, or the possession of their relics.
 The meaner passions of pride, avarice, and revenge, may be deemed unworthy of a celestial breast; yet the saints themselves condescended to testify their grateful approbation of the liberality of their votaries; and the sharpest bolts of punishment were hurled against those impious wretches who violated their magnificent shrines, or disbelieved their supernatural power.
(83) Atrocious, indeed, must have been the guilt, and strange would have been the scepticism, of those men, if they had obstinately resisted the proofs of a divine agency, which the elements, the whole range of the animal creation, and even the subtle and invisible operations of the human mind, were compelled to obey.
(84) The immediate, and almost instantaneous, effects, that were supposed to follow the prayer, or the offence, satisfied the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of the ample measure of favour and authority which the saints enjoyed in the presence of the Supreme God; and it seemed almost superfluous to inquire whether they were continually obliged to intercede before the throne of grace, or whether they might not be permitted to exercise, according to the dictates of their benevolence and justice, the delegated powers of their subordinate ministry.
 The imagination, which had been raised by a painful effort to the contemplation and worship of the Universal Cause, eagerly embraced such inferior objects of adoration as were more proportioned to its gross conceptions and imperfect faculties.
 The sublime and simple theology of the primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> was gradually corrupted: and the MONARCHY of heaven, already clouded by metaphysical subtleties, was degraded by the introduction of a popular mythology which tended to restore the reign of polytheism.
(85) <CARDINAL>4</CARDINAL> Introduction of <NORP>Pagan</NORP> ceremonies.
 4.
 As the objects of religion were gradually reduced to the standard of the imagination, the rites and ceremonies were introduced that seemed most powerfully to affect the senses of the vulgar.
 If, in the beginning of the fifth century,(86) Tertullian, or Lactantius, (87) had been suddenly raised from the dead, to assist at the festival of some popular saint or martyr,(88) they would have gazed with astonishment and indignation on the profane spectacle which had succeeded to the pure and spiritual worship of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> congregation.
 As soon as the doors of the church were thrown open, they must have been offended by the smoke of incense, the perfume of flowers, and the glare of lamps and tapers, which diffused, at noon-day, a gaudy, superfluous, and, in their opinion, a sacrilegious light.
 If they approached the balustrade of the altar, they made their way through the prostrate crowd, consisting, for the most part, of strangers and pilgrims, who resorted to the city on the vigil of the feast; and who already felt the strong intoxication of fanaticism, and, perhaps, of wine.
 Their devout kisses were imprinted on the walls and pavement of the sacred edifice; and their fervent prayers were directed, whatever might be the language of their church, to the bones, the blood, or the ashes of the saint, which were usually concealed, by a linen or silken veil, from the eyes of the vulgar.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> frequented the tombs of the martyrs, in the hope of obtaining, from their powerful intercession, every sort of spiritual, but more especially of temporal, blessings.
 They implored the preservation of their health, or the cure of their infirmities; the fruitfulness of their barren wives, or the safety and happiness of their children.
 Whenever they undertook any distant or dangerous journey, they requested that the holy martyrs would be their guides and protectors on the road; and if they returned without having experienced any misfortune, they again hastened to the tombs of the martyrs, to celebrate, with grateful thanksgivings, their obligations to the memory and relics of those heavenly patrons.
 The walls were hung round with symbols of the favours which they had received; eyes, and hands, and feet, of gold and silver: and edifying pictures, which could not long escape the abuse of indiscreet or idolatrous devotion, represented the image, the attributes, and the miracles of the tutelar saint.
 The same uniform original spirit of superstition might suggest, in the most distant ages and countries, the same methods of deceiving the credulity, and of affecting the senses of mankind:(89) but it must ingenuously be confessed that the ministers of the catholic church imitated the profane model which they were impatient to destroy.
 The most respectable bishops had persuaded themselves that the ignorant rustics would more cheerfully renounce the superstitions of Paganism, if they found some resemblance, some compensation, in the bosom of Christianity.
 The religion of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> achieved, in less than a century, the final conquest of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire: but the victors themselves were insensibly subdued by the arts of their vanquished rivals.
