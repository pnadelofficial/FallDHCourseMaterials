 1204, May 9-16.
 After the death of the lawful princes, the <NORP>French</NORP> and Venetians, confident of justice and victory, agreed to divide and regulate their future possessions.
 (1) It was stipulated by treaty, that <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> electors, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> of either nation, should be nominated; that a majority should choose the emperor of the East; and that, if the votes were equal, the decision of chance should ascertain the successful candidate.
 To him, with all the titles and prerogatives of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne, they assigned the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> palaces of <GPE>Boucoleon</GPE> and Blachernae, with a <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> part of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarchy.
 It was defined that the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> remaining portions should be equally shared between the republic of <GPE>Venice</GPE> and the barons of France; that each feudatory, with an honourable exception for the doge, should acknowledge and perform the duties of homage and military service to the supreme head of the empire; that the nation which gave an emperor, should resign to their brethren the choice of a patriarch; and that the pilgrims, whatever might be their impatience to visit the Holy Land, should devote another year to the conquest and defence of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> provinces.
 After the conquest of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by the Latins, the treaty was confirmed and executed; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most important step was the creation of an emperor.
 The <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> electors of the <NORP>French</NORP> nation were all ecclesiastics, the abbot of Loces, the archbishop elect of Acre in Palestine, and the bishops of Troyes, Soissons, Halberstadt, and Bethlehem, the last of whom exercised in the camp the office of pope's legate: their profession and knowledge were respectable; and as they could not be the objects, they were best qualified to be the authors of the choice.
 The <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <NORP>Venetians</NORP> were the principal servants of the state, and in this list the noble families of <PERSON>Querini</PERSON> and <PERSON>Contarini</PERSON> are still proud to discover their ancestors.
 The <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> assembled in the chapel of the palace; and after the solemn invocation of the Holy Ghost, they proceeded to deliberate and vote.
 A just impulse of respect and gratitude prompted them to crown the virtues of the doge; his wisdom had inspired their enterprise; and the most youthful knights might envy and applaud the exploits of blindness and age.
 But the patriot <GPE>Dandolo</GPE> was devoid of all personal ambition, and fully satisfied that he had been judged worthy to reign.
 His nomination was overruled by the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> themselves: his countrymen, and perhaps his friends, (2) represented, with the eloquence of truth, the mischiefs that might arise to national freedom and the common cause, from the union of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> incompatible characters, of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate of a republic and the emperor of the East.
 The exclusion of the doge left room for the more equal merits of <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> and Baldwin; and at their names all meaner candidates respectfully withdrew.
 The marquis of <GPE>Montferrat</GPE> was recommended by his mature age and fair reputation, by the choice of the adventurers, and the wishes of the Greeks; nor can I believe that Venice, the mistress of the sea, could be seriously apprehensive of a petty lord at the foot of the Alps.
 (3) But the count of <GPE>Flanders</GPE> was the chief of a wealthy and warlike people: he was valiant, pious, and chaste; in the prime of life, since he was only thirty- <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years of age; a descendant of Charlemagne, a cousin of the king of France, and a compeer of the prelates and barons who had yielded with reluctance to the command of a foreigner.
 Without the chapel, these barons, with the doge and marquis at their head, expected the decision of the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> electors.
 It was announced by the bishop of Soissons, in the name of his colleagues: He was saluted with loud applause, and the proclamation was re-echoed through the city by the joy of the Latins, and the trembling adulation of the Greeks.
 <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to kiss the hand of his rival, and to raise him on the buckler: and <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> was transported to the cathedral, and solemnly invested with the purple buskins.
 At the end of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> weeks he was crowned by the legate, in the vacancy of the patriarch; but the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> clergy soon filled the chapter of St.
 Sophia, seated Thomas Morosini on the ecclesiastical throne, and employed every art to perpetuate in their own nation the honours and benefices of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church.
 (4) Without delay the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> instructed Palestine, France, and Rome, of this memorable revolution.
 To <GPE>Palestine</GPE> he sent, as a trophy, the gates of Constantinople, and the chain of the harbour; (5) and adopted, from the Assise of Jerusalem, the laws or customs best adapted to a <NORP>French</NORP> colony and conquest in the East.
 In his epistles, the natives of <GPE>France</GPE> are encouraged to swell that colony, and to secure that conquest, to people a magnificent city and a fertile land, which will reward the labours both of the priest and the soldier.
 He congratulates the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff on the restoration of his authority in the East; invites him to extinguish the <NORP>Greek</NORP> schism by his presence in a general council; and implores his blessing and forgiveness for the disobedient pilgrims.
 Prudence and dignity are blended in the answer of Innocent.
 (6) In the subversion of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire, he arraigns the vices of man, and adores the providence of God; the conquerors will be absolved or condemned by their future conduct; the validity of their treaty depends on the judgment of St.
 Peter; but he inculcates their most sacred duty of establishing a just subordination of obedience and tribute, from the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> to the Latins, from the magistrate to the clergy, and from the clergy to the pope.
 Division of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire.
 In the division of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> provinces, (7) the share of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> was more ample than that of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> emperor.
 No more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> was appropriated to his domain; a clear moiety of the remainder was reserved for Venice; and the other moiety was distributed among the adventures of <GPE>France</GPE> and Lombardy.
 The venerable <GPE>Dandolo</GPE> was proclaimed despot of Romania, and invested after the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fashion with the purple buskins.
 He ended at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> his long and glorious life; and if the prerogative was personal, the title was used by his successors till the middle of the fourteenth century, with the singular, though true, addition of lords of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> and a half of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (8) The doge, a slave of state, was seldom permitted to depart from the helm of the republic; but his place was supplied by the bail, or regent, who exercised a supreme jurisdiction over the colony of Venetians: they possessed <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> of the <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> quarters of the city; and his independent tribunal was composed of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> judges, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> counsellors, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> chamberlains <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fiscal advocates, and a constable.
 Their long experience of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> trade enabled them to select their portion with discernment: they had rashly accepted the dominion and defence of Adrianople; but it was the more reasonable aim of their policy to form a chain of factories, and cities, and islands, along the maritime coast, from the neighbourhood of <GPE>Ragusa</GPE> to the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> and the Bosphorus.
 The labor and cost of such extensive conquests exhausted their treasury: they abandoned their maxims of government, adopted a feudal system, and contented themselves with the homage of their nobles, (9) for the possessions which these private vassals undertook to reduce and maintain.
 And thus it was that the family of <PERSON>Sanut</PERSON> acquired the duchy of Naxos, which involved the greatest part of the archipelago.
 For the price of ten thousand marks, the republic purchased of the marquis of <GPE>Montferrat</GPE> the fertile <LOC>Island</LOC> of <LOC>Crete</LOC> or Candia, with the ruins of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> cities; (10) but its improvement was stinted by the proud and narrow spirit of an aristocracy; (11) and the wisest senators would confess that the sea, not the land, was the treasury of St.
 Mark.
 In the moiety of the adventurers the marquis <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> might claim the most liberal reward; and, besides the Isle of Crete, his exclusion from the throne was compensated by the royal title and the provinces beyond the Hellespont.
 But he prudently exchanged that distant and difficult conquest for the kingdom of <GPE>Thessalonica</GPE> Macedonia, <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> days' journey from the capital, where he might be supported by the neighbouring powers of his brother-in-law the king of Hungary.
 His progress was hailed by the voluntary or reluctant acclamations of the natives; and Greece, the proper and ancient Greece, again received a <NORP>Latin</NORP> conqueror, (12) who trod with indifference that classic ground.
 He viewed with a careless eye the beauties of the valley of Tempe; traversed with a cautious step the straits of Thermopylae; occupied the unknown cities of Thebes, Athens, and Argos; and assaulted the fortifications of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> and Napoli, (13) which resisted his arms.
 The lots of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> pilgrims were regulated by chance, or choice, or subsequent exchange; and they abused, with intemperate joy, their triumph over the lives and fortunes of a great people.
 After a minute survey of the provinces, they weighed in the scales of avarice the revenue of each district, the advantage of the situation, and the ample on scanty supplies for the maintenance of soldiers and horses.
 Their presumption claimed and divided the long-lost dependencies of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> sceptre: the <LOC>Nile</LOC> and <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> rolled through their imaginary realms; and happy was the warrior who drew for his prize the palace of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan of Iconium.
 (14) I shall not descend to the pedigree of families and the rent- roll of estates, but I wish to specify that the counts of <PERSON>Blois</PERSON> and St.
 Pol were invested with the duchy of <PERSON>Nice</PERSON> and the lordship of Demotica: (15) the principal fiefs were held by the service of constable, chamberlain, cup- bearer, butler, and chief cook; and our historian, <PERSON>Jeffrey</PERSON> of Villehardouin, obtained a fair establishment on the banks of the Hebrus, and united the double office of marshal of <PERSON>Champagne</PERSON> and Romania.
 At the head of his knights and archers, each baron mounted on horseback to secure the possession of his share, and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> efforts were generally successful.
 But the public force was weakened by their dispersion; and a thousand quarrels must arise under a law, and among men, whose sole umpire was the sword.
 Within <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months after the conquest of Constantinople, the emperor and the king of <GPE>Thessalonica</GPE> drew their hostile followers into the field; they were reconciled by the authority of the doge, the advice of the marshal, and the firm freedom of their peers.
 (16) Revolt of the Greeks, A.
D.
 1204, etc.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> fugitives, who had reigned at Constantinople, still asserted the title of emperor; and the subjects of their fallen throne might be moved to pity by the misfortunes of the elder Alexius, or excited to revenge by the spirit of Mourzoufle.
 A domestic alliance, a common interest, a similar guilt, and the merit of extinguishing his enemies, a brother and a nephew, induced the more recent usurper to unite with the former the relics of his power.
 <PERSON>Mourzoufle</PERSON> was received with smiles and honours in the camp of his father Alexius; but the wicked can never love, and should rarely trust, their fellow-criminals; he was seized in the bath, deprived of his eyes, stripped of his troops and treasures, and turned out to wander an object of horror and contempt to those who with more propriety could hate, and with more justice could punish, the assassin of the emperor <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> and his son.
 As the tyrant, pursued by fear or remorse, was stealing over to Asia, he was seized by the <NORP>Latins</NORP> of Constantinople, and condemned, after an open trial, to an ignominious death.
 His judges debated the mode of his execution, the axe, the wheel, or the stake; and it was resolved that <PERSON>Mourzoufle</PERSON> (17) should ascend the <NORP>Theodosian</NORP> column, a pillar of white marble of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and forty-seven feet in height.
 (18) From the summit he was cast down headlong, and dashed in pieces on the pavement, in the presence of innumerable spectators, who filled the forum of Taurus, and admired the accomplishment of an old prediction, which was explained by this singular event.
 (19) The fate of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> is less tragical: he was sent by the marquis a captive to Italy, and a gift to the king of the Romans; but he had not much to applaud his fortune, if the sentence of imprisonment and exile were changed from a fortress in the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to a monastery in Asia.
 But his daughter, before the national calamity, had been given in marriage to a young hero who continued the succession, and restored the throne, of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes.
 (20) <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> Lascaris, emperor of Nice.
 A.
D.
 1204-1222.
 The valour of <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> Lascaris was signalized in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sieges of Constantinople.
 After the flight of Mourzoufle, when the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were already in the city, he offered himself as their emperor to the soldiers and people; and his ambition, which might be virtuous, was undoubtedly brave.
 Could he have infused a soul into the multitude, they might have crushed the strangers under their feet: their abject despair refused his aid; and <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> retired to breathe the air of freedom in Anatolia, beyond the immediate view and pursuit of the conquerors.
 Under the title, at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of despot, and afterwards of emperor, he drew to his standard the bolder spirits, who were fortified against slavery by the contempt of life; and as every means was lawful for the public safety implored without scruple the alliance of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan Nice, where <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> established his residence, <PERSON>Prusa</PERSON> and Philadelphia, <GPE>Smyrna</GPE> and Ephesus, opened their gates to their deliverer: he derived strength and reputation from his victories, and even from his defeats; and the successor of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> preserved a fragment of the empire from the banks of the <NORP>Maeander</NORP> to the suburbs of Nicomedia, and at length of Constantinople.
 The dukes and emperors of Trebizond.
 Another portion, distant and obscure, was possessed by the lineal heir of the Comneni, a son of the virtuous Manuel, a grandson of the tyrant Andronicus.
 His name was Alexius; and the epithet of great was applied perhaps to his stature, rather than to his exploits.
 By the indulgence of the Angeli, he was appointed governor or duke of Trebizond: (21) his birth gave him ambition, the revolution independence; and, without changing his title, he reigned in peace from <GPE>Sinope</GPE> to the Phasis, along the coast of the Black Sea.
 His nameless son and successor is described as the vassal of the sultan, whom he served with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> lances: that <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> prince was no more than duke of Trebizond, and the title of emperor was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assumed by the pride and envy of the grandson of Alexius.
 The despots of Epirus.
 In the West, a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> fragment was saved from the common shipwreck by Michael, a bastard of the house of Angeli, who, before the revolution, had been known as a hostage, a soldier, and a rebel.
 His flight from the camp of the marquis <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> secured his freedom; by his marriage with the governor's daughter, he commanded the important place of Durazzo, assumed the title of despot, and founded a strong and conspicuous principality in Epirus, Aetolia, and Thessaly, which have ever been peopled by a warlike race.
 The Greeks, who had offered their service to their new sovereigns, were excluded by the haughty <NORP>Latins</NORP> (22) from all civil and military honours, as a nation born to tremble and obey.
 Their resentment prompted them to show that they might have been useful friends, since they could be dangerous enemies: their nerves were braced by adversity: whatever was learned or holy, whatever was noble or valiant, rolled away into the independent states of Trebizond, Epirus, and Nice; and a single patrician is marked by the ambiguous praise of attachment and loyalty to the Franks.
 The vulgar herd of the cities and the country would have gladly submitted to a mild and regular servitude; and the transient disorders of war would have been obliterated by some years of industry and peace.
 But peace was banished, and industry was crushed, in the disorders of the feudal system.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors of Constantinople, if they were endowed with abilities, were armed with power for the protection of their subjects: their laws were wise, and their administration was simple.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> throne was filled by a titular prince, the chief, and often the servant, of his licentious confederates; the fiefs of the empire, from a kingdom to a castle, were held and ruled by the sword of the barons; and their discord, poverty, and ignorance, extended the ramifications of tyranny to the most sequestered villages.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed by the double weight of the priest, who were invested with temporal power, and of the soldier, who was inflamed by fanatic hatred; and the insuperable bar of religion and language forever separated the stranger and the native.
 As long as the crusaders were united at Constantinople, the memory of their conquest, and the terror of their arms, imposed silence on the captive land: their dispersion betrayed the smallness of their numbers and the defects of their discipline; and some failures and mischances revealed the secret, that they were not invincible.
 As the fears of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> abated, their hatred increased.
 They murdered; they conspired; and before a year of slavery had elapsed, they implored, or accepted, the succour of a Barbarian, whose power they had felt, and whose gratitude they trusted.
 (23) The <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> war, A.
D.
 1205.
 The <NORP>Latin</NORP> conquerors had been saluted with a solemn and early embassy from John, or Joannice, or Calo-John, the revolted chief of the <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> and Walachians.
 He deemed himself their brother, as the votary of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, from whom he had received the regal title and a holy banner; and in the subversion of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarchy, he might aspire to the name of their friend and accomplice.
 But <PERSON>Calo-John</PERSON> was astonished to find, that the Count of <GPE>Flanders</GPE> had assumed the pomp and pride of the successors of Constantine; and his ambassadors were dismissed with a haughty message, that the rebel must deserve a pardon, by touching with his forehead the footstool of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> throne.
 His resentment (24) would have exhaled in acts of violence and blood: his cooler policy watched the rising discontent of the Greeks; affected a tender concern for their sufferings; and promised, that their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> struggles for freedom should be supported by his person and kingdom.
 The conspiracy was propagated by national hatred, the firmest band of association and secrecy: the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were impatient to sheathe their daggers in the breasts of the victorious strangers; but the execution was prudently delayed, till Henry, the emperor's brother, had transported the flower of his troops beyond the Hellespont.
 Most of the towns and villages of <ORG>Thrace</ORG> were true to the moment and the signal; and the Latins, without arms or suspicion, were slaughtered by the vile and merciless revenge of their slaves.
 From Demotica, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> scene of the massacre, the surviving vassals of the count of St.
 Pol escaped to Adrianople; but the <NORP>French</NORP> and Venetians, who occupied that city, were slain or expelled by the furious multitude: the garrisons that could effect their retreat fell back on each other towards the metropolis; and the fortresses, that separately stood against the rebels, were ignorant of each other's and of their sovereign's fate.
 The voice of fame and fear announced the revolt of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the rapid approach of their <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> ally; and Calo-John, not depending on the forces of his own kingdom, had drawn from the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> wilderness a body of fourteen thousand Comans, who drank, as it was said, the blood of their captives, and sacrificed the <NORP>Christians</NORP> on the altars of their gods.
 (25) Alarmed by this sudden and growing danger, the emperor despatched a swift messenger to recall Count <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> and his troops; and had <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> expected the return of his gallant brother, with a supply of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand Armenians, he might have encountered the invader with equal numbers and a decisive superiority of arms and discipline.
 March.
But the spirit of chivalry could seldom discriminate caution from cowardice; and the emperor took the field with a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> knights, and their train of archers and sergeants.
 The marshal, who dissuaded and obeyed, led the vanguard in their march to Adrianople; the main body was commanded by the count of Blois; the aged doge of <GPE>Venice</GPE> followed with the rear; and their scanty numbers were increased from all sides by the fugitive Latins.
 They undertook to besiege the rebels of Adrianople; and such was the pious tendency of the crusades that they employed the holy week in pillaging the country for their subsistence, and in framing engines for the destruction of their fellow- Christians.
 But the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were soon interrupted and alarmed by the light cavalry of the Comans, who boldly skirmished to the edge of their imperfect lines: and a proclamation was issued by the marshal of Romania, that, on the trumpet's sound, the cavalry should mount and form; but that none, under pain of death, should abandon themselves to a desultory and dangerous pursuit.
 This wise injunction was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> disobeyed by the count of Blois, who involved the emperor in his rashness and ruin.
 Defeat and captivity of Baldwin, A.
D.
 1205, April 15.
 The Comans, of the <ORG>Parthian</ORG> or <NORP>Tartar</NORP> school, fled before their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> charge; but after a career of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> leagues, when the knights and their horses were almost breathless, they suddenly turned, rallied, and encompassed the heavy squadrons of the Franks.
 The count was slain on the field; the emperor was made prisoner; and if the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> disdained to fly, if the other refused to yield, their personal bravery made a poor atonement for their ignorance, or neglect, of the duties of a general.
 (26) Retreat of the Latins.
 Proud of his victory and his royal prize, the <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> advanced to relieve <PERSON>Adrianople</PERSON> and achieve the destruction of the Latins.
 They must inevitably have been destroyed, if the marshal of <GPE>Romania</GPE> had not displayed a cool courage and consummate skill; uncommon in all ages, but most uncommon in those times, when war was a passion, rather than a science.
 His grief and fears were poured into the firm and faithful bosom of the doge; but in the camp he diffused an assurance of safety, which could only be realized by the general belief.
 All day he maintained his perilous station between the city and the Barbarians: <PERSON>Villehardouin</PERSON> decamped in silence at the dead of night; and his masterly retreat of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days would have deserved the praise of <PERSON>Xenophon</PERSON> and the ten thousand.
 In the rear, the marshal supported the weight of the pursuit; in the front, he moderated the impatience of the fugitives; and wherever the <NORP>Comans</NORP> approached, they were repelled by a line of impenetrable spears.
 On the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day, the weary troops beheld the sea, the solitary town of Rodosta, (27) and their friends, who had landed from the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore.
 They embraced, they wept; but they united their arms and counsels; and in his brother's absence, Count <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> assumed the regency of the empire, at once in a state of childhood and caducity.
 (28) If the <NORP>Comans</NORP> withdrew from the summer heats, seven thousand Latins, in the hour of danger, deserted Constantinople, their brethren, and their vows.
 Some partial success was overbalanced by the loss of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> knights in the field of Rusium; and of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> domain, no more was left than the capital, with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> adjacent fortresses on the shores of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia.
 The king of <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> was resistless and inexorable; and <PERSON>Calo-John</PERSON> respectfully eluded the demands of the pope, who conjured his new proselyte to restore peace and the emperor to the afflicted Latins.
 Death of the emperor.
 The deliverance of <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> was no longer, he said, in the power of man: that prince had died in prison; and the manner of his death is variously related by ignorance and credulity.
 The lovers of a tragic legend will be pleased to hear, that the royal captive was tempted by the amorous queen of the Bulgarians; that his chaste refusal exposed him to the falsehood of a woman and the jealousy of a savage; that his hands and feet were severed from his body; that his bleeding trunk was cast among the carcasses of dogs and horses; and that he breathed <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days, before he was devoured by the birds of prey.
 (29) About <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years afterwards, in a wood of the Netherlands, a hermit announced himself as the true Baldwin, the emperor of Constantinople, and lawful sovereign of Flanders.
 He related the wonders of his escape, his adventures, and his penance, among a people prone to believe and to rebel; and, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> transport, <GPE>Flanders</GPE> acknowledged her long-lost sovereign.
 A short examination before the <NORP>French</NORP> court detected the impostor, who was punished with an ignominious death; but the <PERSON>Flemings</PERSON> still adhered to the pleasing error; and the countess <PERSON>Jane</PERSON> is accused by the gravest historians of sacrificing to her ambition the life of an unfortunate father.
 (30) Reign and character of Henry, A.
D.
 1206, August 20-A.
D.
 1216, June 11.
 In all civilized hostility, a treaty is established for the exchange or ransom of prisoners; and if their captivity be prolonged, their condition is known, and they are treated according to their rank with humanity or honour.
 But the savage <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> was a stranger to the laws of war: his prisons were involved in darkness and silence; and above a year elapsed before the <NORP>Latins</NORP> could be assured of the death of Baldwin, before his brother, the regent Henry, would consent to assume the title of emperor.
 His moderation was applauded by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> as an act of rare and inimitable virtue.
 Their light and perfidious ambition was eager to seize or anticipate the moment of a vacancy, while a law of succession, the guardian both of the prince and people, was gradually defined and confirmed in the hereditary monarchies of Europe.
 In the support of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was gradually left without an associate, as the heroes of the crusade retired from the world or from the war.
 The doge of Venice, the venerable Dandolo, in the fullness of years and glory, sunk into the grave.
 The marquis of <GPE>Montferrat</GPE> was slowly recalled from the Peloponnesian war to the revenge of <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> and the defence of Thessalonica.
 Some nice disputes of feudal homage and service were reconciled in a personal interview between the emperor and the king; they were firmly united by mutual esteem and the common danger; and their alliance was sealed by the nuptials of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> with the daughter of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> prince.
 He soon deplored the loss of his friend and father.
 At the persuasion of some faithful Greeks, <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> made a bold and successful inroad among the hills of Rhodope: the <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> fled on his approach; they assembled to harass his retreat.
 On the intelligence that his rear was attacked, without waiting for any defensive armour, he leaped on horseback, couched his lance, and drove the enemies before him; but in the rash pursuit he was pierced with a mortal wound; and the head of the king of <GPE>Thessalonica</GPE> was presented to Calo-John, who enjoyed the honours, without the merit, of victory.
 It is here, at this melancholy event, that the pen or the voice of <PERSON>Jeffrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Villehardouin</PERSON> seems to drop or to expire; (31) and if he still exercised his military office of marshal of Romania, his subsequent exploits are buried in oblivion.
 (32) The character of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was not unequal to his arduous situation: in the siege of Constantinople, and beyond the Hellespont, he had deserved the fame of a valiant knight and a skilful commander; and his courage was tempered with a degree of prudence and mildness unknown to his impetuous brother.
 In the double war against the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> of <LOC>Asia</LOC> and the <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> of Europe, he was ever the foremost on shipboard or on horseback; and though he cautiously provided for the success of his arms, the drooping <NORP>Latins</NORP> were often roused by his example to save and to <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> their fearless emperor.
 But such efforts, and some supplies of men and money from France, were of less avail than the errors, the cruelty, and death, of their most formidable adversary.
 When the despair of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> subjects invited Calo- <PERSON>John</PERSON> as their deliverer, they hoped that he would protect their liberty and adopt their laws: they were soon taught to compare the degrees of national ferocity, and to execrate the savage conqueror, who no longer dissembled his intention of dispeopling Thrace, of demolishing the cities, and of transplanting the inhabitants beyond the Danube.
 Many towns and villages of <ORG>Thrace</ORG> were already evacuated: a heap of ruins marked the place of Philippopolis, and a similar calamity was expected at <ORG>Demotica</ORG> and Adrianople, by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> authors of the revolt.
 They raised a cry of grief and repentance to the throne of Henry; the emperor alone had the magnanimity to forgive and trust them.
 No more than <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> knights, with their sergeants and archers, could be assembled under his banner; and with this slender force he fought and repulsed the Bulgarian, who, besides his infantry, was at the head of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> thousand horse.
 In this expedition, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> felt the difference between a hostile and a friendly country: the remaining cities were preserved by his arms; and the savage, with shame and loss, was compelled to relinquish his prey.
 The siege of <GPE>Thessalonica</GPE> was the last of the evils which <PERSON>Calo-John</PERSON> inflicted or suffered: he was stabbed in the <TIME>night</TIME> in his tent; and the general, perhaps the assassin, who found him weltering in his blood, ascribed the blow, with general applause, to the lance of St.
 Demetrius.
 (33) After several victories, the prudence of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> concluded an honourable peace with the successor of the tyrant, and with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes of <PERSON>Nice</PERSON> and Epirus.
 If he ceded some doubtful limits, an ample kingdom was reserved for himself and his feudatories; and his reign, which lasted only ten years, afforded a short interval of prosperity and peace.
 Far above the narrow policy of <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> and Boniface, he freely intrusted to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> the most important offices of the state and army; and this liberality of sentiment and practice was the more seasonable, as the princes of <PERSON>Nice</PERSON> and <PERSON>Epirus</PERSON> had already learned to seduce and employ the mercenary valour of the Latins.
 It was the aim of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> to unite and reward his deserving subjects, of every nation and language; but he appeared less solicitous to accomplish the impracticable union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches.
 Pelagius, the pope's legate, who acted as the sovereign of Constantinople, had interdicted the worship of the Greeks, and sternly imposed the payment of tithes, the double procession of the Holy Ghost, and a blind obedience to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 As the weaker party, they pleaded the duties of conscience, and implored the rights of toleration: The persecution was checked by the firmness of the emperor: (34) and if we can believe that the same prince was poisoned by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> themselves, we must entertain a contemptible idea of the sense and gratitude of mankind.
 His valour was a vulgar attribute, which he shared with ten thousand knights; but <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> possessed the superior courage to oppose, in a superstitious age, the pride and avarice of the clergy.
 In the cathedral of St.
 Sophia he presumed to place his throne on the right hand of the patriarch; and this presumption excited the sharpest censure of Pope Innocent the Third.
 By a salutary edict, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> examples of the laws of mortmain, he prohibited the alienation of fiefs: many of the Latins, desirous of returning to Europe, resigned their estates to the church for a spiritual or temporal reward; these holy lands were immediately discharged from military service, and a colony of soldiers would have been gradually transformed into a college of priests.
 (35) <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> of Courtenay, emperor of Constantinople, A.
D.
 1217, April 9.
 The virtuous <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> died at Thessalonica, in the defence of that kingdom, and of an infant, the son of his friend Boniface.
 In the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emperors of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> the male line of the counts of <GPE>Flanders</GPE> was extinct.
 But their sister <PERSON>Yolande</PERSON> was the wife of a <NORP>French</NORP> prince, the mother of a numerous progeny; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of her daughters had married <PERSON>Andrew</PERSON> king of Hungary, a brave and pious champion of the cross.
 By seating him on the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne, the barons of <GPE>Romania</GPE> would have acquired the forces of a neighbouring and warlike kingdom; but the prudent <PERSON>Andrew</PERSON> revered the laws of succession; and the princess Yolande, with her husband <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> of Courtenay, count of Auxerre, was invited by the <NORP>Latins</NORP> to assume the empire of the East.
 The royal birth of his father, the noble origin of his mother, recommended to the barons of <GPE>France</GPE> the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> cousin of their king.
 His reputation was fair, his possessions were ample, and in the bloody crusade against the Albigeois, the soldiers and the priests had been abundantly satisfied of his zeal and valour.
 Vanity might applaud the elevation of a <NORP>French</NORP> emperor of Constantinople; but prudence must pity, rather than envy, his treacherous and imaginary greatness.
 To assert and adorn his title, he was reduced to sell or mortgage the best of his patrimony.
 By these expedients, the liberality of his royal kinsman <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> Augustus, and the national spirit of chivalry, he was enabled to pass the <LOC>Alps</LOC> at the head of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> knights, and five thousand five <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> sergeants and archers.
 After some hesitation, Pope Honorius the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> was persuaded to crown the successor of Constantine: but he performed the ceremony in a church without the walls, lest he should seem to imply or to bestow any right of sovereignty over the ancient capital of the empire.
 The <NORP>Venetians</NORP> had engaged to transport <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and his forces beyond the Adriatic, and the empress, with her <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> children, to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace; but they required, as the price of their service, that he should recover <GPE>Durazzo</GPE> from the despot of Epirus.
 <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> Angelus, or Comnenus, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of his dynasty, had bequeathed the succession of his power and ambition to Theodore, his legitimate brother, who already threatened and invaded the establishments of the Latins.
 After discharging his debt by a fruitless assault, the emperor raised the siege to prosecute a long and perilous journey over land from <GPE>Durazzo</GPE> to Thessalonica.
 His captivity and death, A.
D.
 1217- 1219.
 He was soon lost in the mountains of Epirus: the passes were fortified; his provisions exhausted; he was delayed and deceived by a treacherous negotiation; and, after <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> of <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legate had been arrested in a banquet, the <NORP>French</NORP> troops, without leaders or hopes, were eager to exchange their arms for the delusive promise of mercy and bread.
 The <FAC>Vatican</FAC> thundered; and the impious <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> was threatened with the vengeance of earth and heaven; but the captive emperor and his soldiers were forgotten, and the reproaches of the pope are confined to the imprisonment of his legate.
 No sooner was he satisfied by the deliverance of the priests and a promise of spiritual obedience, than he pardoned and protected the despot of Epirus.
 His peremptory commands suspended the ardour of the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> and the king of Hungary; and it was only by a natural or untimely death (36) that <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> of <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> was released from his hopeless captivity.
 (37) <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> emperor of Constantinople, A.
D.
 1221- 1228.
 The long ignorance of his fate, and the presence of the lawful sovereign, of Yolande, his wife or widow, delayed the proclamation of a new emperor.
 Before her death, and in the midst of her grief, she was delivered of a son, who was named Baldwin, the last and most unfortunate of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes of Constantinople.
 His birth endeared him to the barons of Romania; but his childhood would have prolonged the troubles of a minority, and his claims were superseded by the elder claims of his brethren.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these, <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> of Courtenay, who derived from his mother the inheritance of Namur, had the wisdom to prefer the substance of a marquisate to the shadow of an empire; and on his refusal, Robert, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> of the sons of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and Yolande, was called to the throne of Constantinople.
 Warned by his father's mischance, he pursued his slow and secure journey through <GPE>Germany</GPE> and along the Danube: a passage was opened by his sister's marriage with the king of Hungary; and the emperor <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> was crowned by the patriarch in the cathedral of St.
 Sophia.
 But his reign was an aera of calamity and disgrace; and the colony, as it was styled, of New <GPE>France</GPE> yielded on all sides to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> of <PERSON>Nice</PERSON> and Epirus.
 After a victory, which he owed to his perfidy rather than his courage, <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> Angelus entered the kingdom of Thessalonica, expelled the feeble Demetrius, the son of the marquis Boniface, erected his standard on the walls of Adrianople; and added, by his vanity, a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> or a <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> name to the list of rival emperors.
 The relics of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> province were swept away by <PERSON>John</PERSON> Vataces, the son-in-law and successor of <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> Lascaris, and who, in a triumphant reign of thirty-three years, displayed the virtues both of peace and war.
 Under his discipline, the swords of the <NORP>French</NORP> mercenaries were the most effectual instruments of his conquests, and their desertion from the service of their country was at once a symptom and a cause of the rising ascendant of the Greeks.
 By the construction of a fleet, he obtained the command of the Hellespont, reduced the islands of <LOC>Lesbos</LOC> and Rhodes, attacked the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> of Candia, and intercepted the rare and parsimonious succours of the West.
 Once, and once only, the <NORP>Latin</NORP> emperor sent an army against Vataces; and in the defeat of that army, the veteran knights, the last of the original conquerors, were left on the field of battle.
 But the success of a foreign enemy was less painful to the pusillanimous <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> than the insolence of his <NORP>Latin</NORP> subjects, who confounded the weakness of the emperor and of the empire.
 His personal misfortunes will prove the anarchy of the government and the ferociousness of the times.
 The amorous youth had neglected his <NORP>Greek</NORP> bride, the daughter of Vataces, to introduce into the palace a beautiful maid, of a private, though noble family of Artois; and her mother had been tempted by the lustre of the purple to forfeit her engagements with a gentleman of Burgundy.
 His love was converted into rage; he assembled his friends, forced the palace gates, threw the mother into the sea, and inhumanly cut off the nose and lips of the wife or concubine of the emperor.
 Instead of punishing the offender, the barons avowed and applauded the savage deed, (38) which, as a prince and as a man, it was impossible that <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> should forgive.
 He escaped from the guilty city to implore the justice or compassion of the pope: the emperor was coolly exhorted to return to his station; before he could obey, he sunk under the weight of grief, shame, and impotent resentment.
 (39) <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> II.
 and <PERSON>John</PERSON> of Brienne, emperors of Constantinople, A.
D.
 1228-1237.
 It was only in the age of chivalry, that valour could ascend from a private station to the thrones of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> and Constantinople.
 The titular kingdom of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> had devolved to Mary, the daughter of <PERSON>Isabella</PERSON> and <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> of Montferrat, and the granddaughter of <PERSON>Almeric</PERSON> or Amaury.
 She was given to <PERSON>John</PERSON> of Brienne, of a noble family in Champagne, by the public voice, and the judgment of <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> Augustus, who named him as the most worthy champion of the Holy Land.
 (40) In the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> crusade, he led a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Latins</NORP> to the conquest of Egypt: by him the siege of <GPE>Damietta</GPE> was achieved; and the subsequent failure was justly ascribed to the pride and avarice of the legate.
 After the marriage of his daughter with <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, (41) he was provoked by the emperor's ingratitude to accept the command of the army of the church; and though advanced in life, and despoiled of royalty, the sword and spirit of <PERSON>John</PERSON> of <PERSON>Brienne</PERSON> were still ready for the service of Christendom.
 In the seven years of his brother's reign, <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> of <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> had not emerged from a state of childhood, and the barons of <GPE>Romania</GPE> felt the strong necessity of placing the sceptre in the hands of a man and a hero.
 The veteran king of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> might have disdained the name and office of regent; they agreed to invest him for his life with the title and prerogatives of emperor, on the sole condition that <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> should marry his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> daughter, and succeed at a mature age to the throne of Constantinople.
 The expectation, both of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, was kindled by the renown, the choice, and the presence of <PERSON>John</PERSON> of Brienne; and they admired his martial aspect, his green and vigorous age of more than fourscore years, and his size and stature, which surpassed the common measure of mankind.
 (42) But avarice, and the love of ease, appear to have chilled the ardour of enterprise: his troops were disbanded, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years rolled away without action or honour, till he was awakened by the dangerous alliance of <PERSON>Vataces</PERSON> emperor of Nice, and of <GPE>Azan</GPE> king of Bulgaria.
 They besieged <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by sea and land, with an army of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand men, and a fleet of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> ships of war; while the entire force of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> emperor was reduced to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty knights, and a small addition of sergeants and archers.
 I tremble to relate, that instead of defending the city, the hero made a sally at the head of his cavalry; and that of <CARDINAL>forty-eight</CARDINAL> squadrons of the enemy, no more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> escaped from the edge of his invincible sword.
 Fired by his example, the infantry and the citizens boarded the vessels that anchored close to the walls; and <CARDINAL>twenty-five</CARDINAL> were dragged in triumph into the harbour of Constantinople.
 At the summons of the emperor, the vassals and allies armed in her defence; broke through every obstacle that opposed their passage; and, in the succeeding year, obtained a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> victory over the same enemies.
 By the rude poets of the age, <PERSON>John</PERSON> of <PERSON>Brienne</PERSON> is compared to Hector, Roland, and Judas Machabaeus: (43) but their credit, and his glory, receive some abatement from the silence of the Greeks.
 The empire was soon deprived of the last of her champions; and the dying monarch was ambitious to enter paradise in the habit of a <NORP>Franciscan</NORP> friar.
 (44) <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> II.
 A.
D.
 1237, <DATE>March</DATE> 23- A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>1261</CARDINAL> July 25.
 In the double victory of <PERSON>John</PERSON> of Brienne, I cannot discover the name or exploits of his pupil Baldwin, who had attained the age of military service, and who succeeded to the imperial dignity on the decease of his adoptive father.
 (45) The royal youth was employed on a commission more suitable to his temper; he was sent to visit the <NORP>Western</NORP> courts, of the pope more especially, and of the king of France; to excite their pity by the view of his innocence and distress; and to obtain some supplies of men or money for the relief of the sinking empire.
 He thrice repeated these mendicant visits, in which he seemed to prolong his stay and postpone his return; of the five-and-twenty years of his reign, a greater number were spent abroad than at home; and in no place did the emperor deem himself less free and secure than in his native country and his capital.
 On some public occasions, his vanity might be soothed by the title of Augustus, and by the honours of the purple; and at the general council of Lyons, when <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> was excommunicated and deposed, his <NORP>Oriental</NORP> colleague was enthroned on the right hand of the pope.
 But how often was the exile, the vagrant, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> beggar, humbled with scorn, insulted with pity, and degraded in his own eyes and those of the nations! In his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> visit to England, he was stopped at <GPE>Dover</GPE> by a severe reprimand, that he should presume, without leave, to enter an independent kingdom.
 After some delay, Baldwin, however, was permitted to pursue his journey, was entertained with cold civility, and thankfully departed with a present of seven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> marks.
 (46) From the avarice of <GPE>Rome</GPE> he could only obtain the proclamation of a crusade, and a treasure of indulgences; a coin whose currency was depreciated by too frequent and indiscriminate abuse.
 His birth and misfortunes recommended him to the generosity of his cousin Louis the Ninth; but the martial zeal of the saint was diverted from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Palestine; and the public and private poverty of <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> was alleviated, for a moment, by the alienation of the marquisate of <GPE>Namur</GPE> and the lordship of Courtenay, the last remains of his inheritance.
 (47) By such shameful or ruinous expedients, he once more returned to Romania, with an army of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand soldiers, whose numbers were doubled in the apprehension of the Greeks.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> despatches to <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>England</GPE> announced his victories and his hopes: he had reduced the country round the capital to the distance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days' journey; and if he succeeded against an important, though nameless, city, (most probably Chiorli,) the frontier would be safe and the passage accessible.
 But these expectations (if <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> was sincere) quickly vanished like a dream: the troops and treasures of <GPE>France</GPE> melted away in his unskilful hands; and the throne of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> emperor was protected by a dishonourable alliance with the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Comans.
 To secure the former, he consented to bestow his niece on the unbelieving sultan of Cogni; to please the latter, he complied with their <NORP>Pagan</NORP> rites; a dog was sacrificed between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies; and the contracting parties tasted each other's blood, as a pledge of their fidelity.
 (48) In the palace, or prison, of Constantinople, the successor of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> demolished the vacant houses for winter fuel, and stripped the lead from the churches for the daily expense of his family.
 Some usurious loans were dealt with a scanty hand by the merchants of Italy; and Philip, his son and heir, was pawned at <GPE>Venice</GPE> as the security for a debt.
 (49) Thirst, hunger, and nakedness, are positive evils: but wealth is relative; and a prince who would be rich in a private station, may be exposed by the increase of his wants to all the anxiety and bitterness of poverty.
 The holy crown of thorns.
 But in this abject distress, the emperor and empire were still possessed of an ideal treasure, which drew its fantastic value from the superstition of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world.
 The merit of the true cross was somewhat impaired by its frequent division; and a long captivity among the infidels might shed some suspicion on the fragments that were produced in the <LOC>East</LOC> and West.
 But another relic of the <WORK_OF_ART>Passion</WORK_OF_ART> was preserved in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> chapel of Constantinople; and the crown of thorns which had been placed on the head of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was equally precious and authentic.
 It had formerly been the practice of the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> debtors to deposit, as a security, the mummies of their parents; and both their honour and religion were bound for the redemption of the pledge.
 In the same manner, and in the absence of the emperor, the barons of <GPE>Romania</GPE> borrowed the sum of thirteen thousand <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and thirty-four pieces of gold (50) on the credit of the holy crown: they failed in the performance of their contract; and a rich Venetian, Nicholas Querini, undertook to satisfy their impatient creditors, on condition that the relic should be lodged at Venice, to become his absolute property, if it were not redeemed within a short and definite term.
 The barons apprised their sovereign of the hard treaty and impending loss and as the empire could not afford a ransom of seven thousand pounds sterling, <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> was anxious to snatch the prize from the Venetians, and to vest it with more honour and emolument in the hands of the most <NORP>Christian</NORP> king.
 (51) Yet the negotiation was attended with some delicacy.
 In the purchase of relics, the saint would have started at the guilt of simony; but if the mode of expression were changed, he might lawfully repay the debt, accept the gift, and acknowledge the obligation.
 His ambassadors, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Dominicans, were despatched to <GPE>Venice</GPE> to redeem and receive the holy crown which had escaped the dangers of the sea and the galleys of Vataces.
 On opening a wooden box, they recognized the seals of the doge and barons, which were applied on a shrine of silver; and within this shrine the monument of the <WORK_OF_ART>Passion</WORK_OF_ART> was enclosed in a golden vase.
 The reluctant <NORP>Venetians</NORP> yielded to justice and power: the emperor <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> granted a free and honourable passage; the court of <GPE>France</GPE> advanced as far as <PERSON>Troyes</PERSON> in Champagne, to meet with devotion this inestimable relic: it was borne in triumph through <GPE>Paris</GPE> by the king himself, barefoot, and in his shirt; and a free gift of ten thousand marks of silver reconciled <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> to his loss.
 The success of this transaction tempted the <NORP>Latin</NORP> emperor to offer with the same generosity the remaining furniture of his chapel; (52) a large and authentic portion of the true cross; the baby-linen of the Son of God, the lance, the sponge, and the chain, of his Passion; the rod of Moses, and part of the skull of St.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Baptist.
 For the reception of these spiritual treasures, <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand marks were expended by St.
 Louis on a stately foundation, the holy chapel of Paris, on which the muse of <PERSON>Boileau</PERSON> has bestowed a comic immortality.
 The truth of such remote and ancient relics, which cannot be proved by any human testimony, must be admitted by those who believe in the miracles which they have performed.
 About the middle of the last age, an inveterate ulcer was touched and cured by a holy prickle of the holy crown: (53) the prodigy is attested by the most pious and enlightened <NORP>Christians</NORP> of France; nor will the fact be easily disproved, except by those who are armed with a general antidote against religious credulity.
 (54) Progress of the Greeks, A.
D.
 1237-1261.
 The <NORP>Latins</NORP> of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> (55) were on all sides encompassed and pressed; their sole hope, the last delay of their ruin, was in the division of their <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> enemies; and of this hope they were deprived by the superior arms and policy of Vataces, emperor of Nice.
 From the <LOC>Propontis</LOC> to the rocky coast of Pamphylia, <LOC>Asia</LOC> was peaceful and prosperous under his reign; and the events of every campaign extended his influence in Europe.
 The strong cities of the hills of <GPE>Macedonia</GPE> and <ORG>Thrace</ORG> were rescued from the Bulgarians; and their kingdom was circumscribed by its present and proper limits, along the southern banks of the Danube.
 The sole emperor of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> could no longer brook that a lord of Epirus, a <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> prince of the West, should presume to dispute or share the honours of the purple; and the humble <PERSON>Demetrius</PERSON> changed the colour of his buskins, and accepted with gratitude the appellation of despot.
 His own subjects were exasperated by his baseness and incapacity; they implored the protection of their supreme lord.
 After some resistance, the kingdom of <GPE>Thessalonica</GPE> was united to the empire of Nice; and <PERSON>Vataces</PERSON> reigned without a competitor from the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> borders to the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf.
 The princes of <LOC>Europe</LOC> revered his merit and power; and had he subscribed an orthodox creed, it should seem that the pope would have abandoned without reluctance the <NORP>Latin</NORP> throne of Constantinople.
 But the death of Vataces, the short and busy reign of <PERSON>Theodore</PERSON> his son, and the helpless infancy of his grandson John, suspended the restoration of the Greeks.
 In the next chapter, I shall explain their domestic revolutions; in this place, it will be sufficient to observe, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> Paeologus, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor, A.
D.
 1259, December 1.
 that the young prince was oppressed by the ambition of his guardian and colleague, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> Palaeologus, who displayed the virtues and vices that belong to the founder of a new dynasty.
 The emperor <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> had flattered himself, that he might recover some provinces or cities by an impotent negotiation.
 His ambassadors were dismissed from <PERSON>Nice</PERSON> with mockery and contempt.
 At every place which they named, <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> alleged some special reason, which rendered it dear and valuable in his eyes: in the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> he was born; in another he had been <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> promoted to military command; and in a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> he had enjoyed, and hoped long to enjoy, the pleasures of the chase.
 "And what then do you propose to give us?" said the astonished deputies.
 An expedition against the despot of <PERSON>Epirus</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> prelude of his arms.
 If a victory was followed by a defeat; if the race of the <NORP>Comneni</NORP> or <PERSON>Angeli</PERSON> survived in those mountains his efforts and his reign; the captivity of Villehardouin, prince of Achaia, deprived the <NORP>Latins</NORP> of the most active and powerful vassal of their expiring monarchy.
 The republics of <GPE>Venice</GPE> and <GPE>Genoa</GPE> disputed, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of their naval wars, the command of the sea and the commerce of the East.
 Pride and interest attached the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> to the defence of Constantinople; their rivals were tempted to promote the designs of her enemies, and the alliance of the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> with the schismatic conqueror provoked the indignation of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church.
 (57) <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> recovered by the Greeks, A.
D.
 1261, July 25.
 Intent on his great object, the emperor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> visited in person and strengthened the troops and fortifications of Thrace.
 The remains of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were driven from their last possessions: he assaulted without success the suburb of Galata; and corresponded with a perfidious baron, who proved unwilling, or unable, to open the gates of the metropolis.
 The next spring, his favourite general, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> Strategopulus, whom he had decorated with the title of Caesar, passed the <PERSON>Hellespont</PERSON> with <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horse and some infantry, (58) on a secret expedition.
 His instructions enjoined him to approach, to listen, to watch, but not to risk any doubtful or dangerous enterprise against the city.
 The adjacent territory between the <LOC>Propontis</LOC> and the Black Sea was cultivated by a hardy race of peasants and outlaws, exercised in arms, uncertain in their allegiance, but inclined by language, religion, and present advantage, to the party of the Greeks.
 They were styled the volunteers; (59) and by their free service the army of Alexius, with the regulars of <ORG>Thrace</ORG> and the <ORG>Coman</ORG> auxiliaries, (60) was augmented to the number of five-and-twenty thousand men.
 By the ardour of the volunteers, and by his own ambition, the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> was stimulated to disobey the precise orders of his master, in the just confidence that success would plead his pardon and reward.
 The weakness of Constantinople, and the distress and terror of the Latins, were familiar to the observation of the volunteers; and they represented the present moment as the most propitious to surprise and conquest.
 A rash youth, the new governor of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> colony, had sailed away with <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> galleys, and the best of the <NORP>French</NORP> knights, on a wild expedition to Daphnusia, a town on the Black Sea, at the distance of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> leagues; and the remaining <NORP>Latins</NORP> were without strength or suspicion.
 They were informed that <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had passed the Hellespont; but their apprehensions were lulled by the smallness of his original numbers; and their imprudence had not watched the subsequent increase of his army.
 If he left his main body to <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and support his operations, he might advance unperceived in the <TIME>night</TIME> with a chosen detachment.
 While some applied scaling-ladders to the lowest part of the walls, they were secure of an old Greek, who would introduce their companions through a subterraneous passage into his house; they could soon on the inside break an entrance through the golden gate, which had been long obstructed; and the conqueror would be in the heart of the city before the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were conscious of their danger.
 After some debate, the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> resigned himself to the faith of the volunteers; they were trusty, bold, and successful; and in describing the plan, I have already related the execution and success.
 (61) But no sooner had <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> passed the threshold of the golden gate, than he trembled at his own rashness; he paused, he deliberated; till the desperate volunteers urged him forwards, by the assurance that in retreat lay the greatest and most inevitable danger.
 Whilst the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> kept his regulars in firm array, the <NORP>Comans</NORP> dispersed themselves on all sides; an alarm was sounded, and the threats of fire and pillage compelled the citizens to a decisive resolution.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> remembered their native sovereigns; the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> merchants their recent alliance and <NORP>Venetian</NORP> foes; every quarter was in arms; and the air resounded with a general acclamation of "Long life and victory to <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> and John, the august emperors of the Romans!" Their rival, Baldwin, was awakened by the sound; but the most pressing danger could not prompt him to draw his sword in the defence of a city which he deserted, perhaps, with more pleasure than regret: he fled from the palace to the seashore, where he descried the welcome sails of the fleet returning from the vain and fruitless attempt on Daphnusia.
 <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was irrecoverably lost; but the <NORP>Latin</NORP> emperor and the principal families embarked on board the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> galleys, and steered for the Isle of Euboea, and afterwards for Italy, where the royal fugitive was entertained by the pope and <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> king with a mixture of contempt and pity.
 From the loss of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to his death, he consumed thirteen years, soliciting the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> powers to join in his restoration: the lesson had been familiar to his youth; nor was his last exile more indigent or shameful than his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> former pilgrimages to the courts of Europe.
 His son <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> was the heir of an ideal empire; and the pretensions of his daughter <PERSON>Catherine</PERSON> were transported by her marriage to Charles of Valois, the brother of <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> the Fair, king of France.
 The house of <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> was represented in the female line by successive alliances, till the title of emperor of Constantinople, too bulky and sonorous for a private name, modestly expired in silence and oblivion.
 (62) General consequences of the crusades.
 After this narrative of the expeditions of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> to <GPE>Palestine</GPE> and Constantinople, I cannot dismiss the subject without resolving the general consequences on the countries that were the scene, and on the nations that were the actors, of these memorable crusades.
 (63) As soon as the arms of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> were withdrawn, the impression, though not the memory, was erased in the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> realms of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Syria.
 The faithful disciples of the prophet were never tempted by a profane desire to study the laws or language of the idolaters; nor did the simplicity of their primitive manners receive the slightest alteration from their intercourse in peace and war with the unknown strangers of the West.
 The Greeks, who thought themselves proud, but who were only vain, showed a disposition somewhat less inflexible.
 In the efforts for the recovery of their empire, they emulated the valour, discipline, and tactics of their antagonists.
 The modern literature of the <LOC>West</LOC> they might justly despise; but its free spirit would instruct them in the rights of man; and some institutions of public and private life were adopted from the French.
 The correspondence of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> diffused the knowledge of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> tongue; and several of the fathers and classics were at length honoured with a <NORP>Greek</NORP> version.
 (64) But the national and religious prejudices of the <NORP>Orientals</NORP> were inflamed by persecution, and the reign of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> confirmed the separation of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches.
 If we compare the aera of the crusades, the <NORP>Latins</NORP> of <LOC>Europe</LOC> with the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Arabians, their respective degrees of knowledge, industry, and art, our rude ancestors must be content with the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> rank in the scale of nations.
 Their successive improvement and present superiority may be ascribed to a peculiar energy of character, to an active and imitative spirit, unknown to their more polished rivals, who at that time were in a stationary or retrograde state.
 With such a disposition, the <NORP>Latins</NORP> should have derived the most early and essential benefits from a series of events which opened to their eyes the prospect of the world, and introduced them to a long and frequent intercourse with the more cultivated regions of the East.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most obvious progress was in trade and manufactures, in the arts which are strongly prompted by the thirst of wealth, the calls of necessity, and the gratification of the sense or vanity.
 Among the crowd of unthinking fanatics, a captive or a pilgrim might sometimes observe the superior refinements of <GPE>Cairo</GPE> and Constantinople: the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> importer of windmills (65) was the benefactor of nations; and if such blessings are enjoyed without any grateful remembrance, history has condescended to notice the more apparent luxuries of silk and sugar, which were transported into <GPE>Italy</GPE> from <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Egypt.
 But the intellectual wants of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> were more slowly felt and supplied; the ardour of studious curiosity was awakened in <LOC>Europe</LOC> by different causes and more recent events; and, in the age of the crusades, they viewed with careless indifference the literature of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Arabians.
 Some rudiments of mathematical and medicinal knowledge might be imparted in practice and in figures; necessity might produce some interpreters for the grosser business of merchants and soldiers; but the commerce of the <NORP>Orientals</NORP> had not diffused the study and knowledge of their languages in the schools of Europe.
 (66) If a similar principle of religion repulsed the idiom of the Koran, it should have excited their patience and curiosity to understand the original text of the gospel; and the same grammar would have unfolded the sense of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> and the beauties of Homer.
 Yet in a reign of sixty years, the <NORP>Latins</NORP> of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> disdained the speech and learning of their subjects; and the manuscripts were the only treasures which the natives might enjoy without rapine or envy.
 <PERSON>Aristotle</PERSON> was indeed the oracle of the <NORP>Western</NORP> universities, but it was a barbarous Aristotle; and, instead of ascending to the fountain head, his <NORP>Latin</NORP> votaries humbly accepted a corrupt and remote version, from the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and <NORP>Moors</NORP> of Andalusia.
 The principle of the crusades was a savage fanaticism; and the most important effects were analogous to the cause.
 Each pilgrim was ambitious to return with his sacred spoils, the relics of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Palestine; (67) and each relic was preceded and followed by a train of miracles and visions.
 The belief of the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> was corrupted by new legends, their practice by new superstitions; and the establishment of the inquisition, the mendicant orders of monks and friars, the last abuse of indulgences, and the final progress of idolatry, flowed from the baleful fountain of the holy war.
 The active spirit of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> preyed on the vitals of their reason and religion; and if the ninth and tenth centuries were the times of darkness, the thirteenth and fourteenth were the age of absurdity and fable.
 In the profession of Christianity, in the cultivation of a fertile land, the northern conquerors of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire insensibly mingled with the provincials, and rekindled the embers of the arts of antiquity.
 Their settlements about the age of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> had acquired some degree of order and stability, when they were overwhelmed by new swarms of invaders, the Normans, Saracens, (68) and Hungarians, who replunged the western countries of <LOC>Europe</LOC> into their former state of anarchy and barbarism.
 About the eleventh century, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> tempest had subsided by the expulsion or conversion of the enemies of Christendom: the tide of civilization, which had so long ebbed, began to flow with a steady and accelerated course; and a fairer prospect was opened to the hopes and efforts of the rising generations.
 Great was the increase, and rapid the progress, during the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years of the crusades; and some philosophers have applauded the propitious influence of these holy wars, which appear to me to have checked rather than forwarded the maturity of Europe.
 (69) The lives and labours of millions, which were buried in the East, would have been more profitably employed in the improvement of their native country: the accumulated stock of industry and wealth would have overflowed in navigation and trade; and the <NORP>Latins</NORP> would have been enriched and enlightened by a pure and friendly correspondence with the climates of the East.
 In <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> respect I can indeed perceive the accidental operation of the crusades, not so much in producing a benefit as in removing an evil.
 The larger portion of the inhabitants of <LOC>Europe</LOC> was chained to the soil, without freedom, or property, or knowledge; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> orders of ecclesiastics and nobles, whose numbers were comparatively small, alone deserved the name of citizens and men.
 This oppressive system was supported by the arts of the clergy and the swords of the barons.
 The authority of the priests operated in the darker ages as a salutary antidote: they prevented the total extinction of letters, mitigated the fierceness of the times, sheltered the poor and defenceless, and preserved or revived the peace and order of civil society.
 But the independence, rapine, and discord of the feudal lords were unmixed with any semblance of good; and every hope of industry and improvement was crushed by the iron weight of the martial aristocracy.
 Among the causes that undermined that <NORP>Gothic</NORP> edifice, a conspicuous place must be allowed to the crusades.
 The estates of the barons were dissipated, and their race was often extinguished, in these costly and perilous expeditions.
 Their poverty extorted from their pride those charters of freedom which unlocked the fetters of the slave, secured the farm of the peasant and the shop of the artificer, and gradually restored a substance and a soul to the most numerous and useful part of the community.
 The conflagration which destroyed the tall and barren trees of the forest gave air and scope to the vegetation of the smaller and nutritive plants of the soil.
 The purple of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> emperors, who have reigned at Constantinople, will authorize or excuse a digression on the origin and singular fortunes of the house of COURTENAY, (70) in the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> principal branches: I.
 Of Edessa; II.
 Of France; and III.
 Of England; of which the last only has survived the revolutions of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years.

 Before the introduction of trade, which scatters riches, and of knowledge, which dispels prejudice, the prerogative of birth is most strongly felt and most humbly acknowledged.
 In every age, the laws and manners of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> have discriminated the ranks of society; the dukes and counts, who shared the empire of Charlemagne, converted their office to an inheritance; and to his children, each feudal lord bequeathed his honour and his sword.
 The proudest families are content to lose, in the darkness of the middle ages, the tree of their pedigree, which, however deep and lofty, must ultimately rise from a plebeian root; and their historians must descend ten centuries below the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aera, before they can ascertain any lineal succession by the evidence of surnames, of arms, and of authentic records.
 With the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rays of light, (71) we discern the nobility and opulence of Atho, a <NORP>French</NORP> knight; his nobility, in the rank and title of a nameless father; his opulence, in the foundation of the castle of <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> in the district of Gatinois, about fifty-six miles to the south of Paris.
 From the reign of Robert, the son of <PERSON>Hugh</PERSON> Capet, the barons of <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> are conspicuous among the immediate vassals of the crown; and Joscelin, the grandson of <PERSON>Atho</PERSON> and a noble dame, is enrolled among the heroes of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade.
 A domestic alliance (their mothers were sisters) attached him to the standard of <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> of Bruges, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> count of Edessa; a princely fief, which he was worthy to receive, and able to maintain, announces the number of his martial followers; and after the departure of his cousin, <PERSON>Joscelin</PERSON> himself was invested with the county of <GPE>Edessa</GPE> on both sides of the Euphrates.
 By economy in peace, his territories were replenished with <NORP>Latin</NORP> and <NORP>Syrian</NORP> subjects; his magazines with corn, wine, and oil; his castles with gold and silver, with arms and horses.
 In a holy warfare of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, he was alternately a conqueror and a captive: but he died like a soldier, in a horse litter at the head of his troops; and his last glance beheld the flight of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> invaders who had presumed on his age and infirmities.
 His son and successor, of the same name, was less deficient in valour than in vigilance; but he sometimes forgot that dominion is acquired and maintained by the same arms.
 He challenged the hostility of the Turks, without securing the friendship of the prince of Antioch; and, amidst the peaceful luxury of Turbessel, in Syria, (72) <PERSON>Joscelin</PERSON> neglected the defence of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> frontier beyond the Euphrates.
 In his absence, Zenghi, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the Atabeks, besieged and stormed his capital, Edessa, which was feebly defended by a timorous and disloyal crowd of Orientals: the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> were oppressed in a bold attempt for its recovery, and <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> ended his days in the prison of Aleppo.
 He still left a fair and ample patrimony But the victorious <NORP>Turks</NORP> oppressed on all sides the weakness of a widow and orphan; and, for the equivalent of an <DATE>annual</DATE> pension, they resigned to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor the charge of defending, and the shame of losing, the last relics of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> conquest.
 The countess-dowager of <GPE>Edessa</GPE> retired to <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> with her <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> children; the daughter, Agnes, became the wife and mother of a king; the son, <PERSON>Joscelin</PERSON> the Third, accepted the office of seneschal, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the kingdom, and held his new estates in <GPE>Palestine</GPE> by the service of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> knights.
 His name appears with honour in the transactions of peace and war; but he finally vanishes in the fall of Jerusalem; and the name of Courtenay, in this branch of Edessa, was lost by the marriage of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> daughters with a <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>German</NORP> baron.
 (73) II.
 The <PERSON>Courtenays</PERSON> of France.
 While <PERSON>Joscelin</PERSON> reigned beyond the Euphrates, his elder brother Milo, the son of Joscelin, the son of Atho, continued, near the Seine, to possess the castle of their fathers, which was at length inherited by Rainaud, or Reginald, the youngest of his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons.
 Examples of genius or virtue must be rare in the annals of the oldest families; and, in a remote age their pride will embrace a deed of rapine and violence; such, however, as could not be perpetrated without some superiority of courage, or, at least, of power.
 A descendant of <PERSON>Reginald</PERSON> of <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> may blush for the public robber, who stripped and imprisoned several merchants, after they had satisfied the king's duties at <ORG>Sens</ORG> and Orleans.
 He will glory in the offence, since the bold offender could not be compelled to obedience and restitution, till the regent and the count of <PERSON>Champagne</PERSON> prepared to march against him at the head of an army.
 (74) Their alliance with the royal family, A.
D.
 1050.
 <PERSON>Reginald</PERSON> bestowed his estates on his eldest daughter, and his daughter on the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> son of King Louis the Fat; and their marriage was crowned with a numerous offspring.
 We might expect that a private should have merged in a royal name; and that the descendants of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> of <GPE>France</GPE> and <PERSON>Elizabeth</PERSON> of <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> would have enjoyed the titles and honours of princes of the blood.
 But this legitimate claim was long neglected, and finally denied; and the causes of their disgrace will represent the story of this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> branch.
 1.
 Of all the families now extant, the most ancient, doubtless, and the most illustrious, is the house of France, which has occupied the same throne above <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, and descends, in a clear and lineal series of males, from the middle of the ninth century.
 (75) In the age of the crusades, it was already revered both in the <LOC>East</LOC> and West.
 But from <PERSON>Hugh</PERSON> Capet to the marriage of Peter, no more than five reigns or generations had elapsed; and so precarious was their title, that the eldest sons, as a necessary precaution, were previously crowned during the lifetime of their fathers.
 The peers of <GPE>France</GPE> have long maintained their precedency before the younger branches of the royal line, nor had the princes of the blood, in the twelfth century, acquired that hereditary lustre which is now diffused over the most remote candidates for the succession.
 2.
 The barons of <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> must have stood high in their own estimation, and in that of the world, since they could impose on the son of a king the obligation of adopting for himself and all his descendants the name and arms of their daughter and his wife.
 In the marriage of an heiress with her inferior or her equal, such exchange often required and allowed: but as they continued to diverge from the regal stem, the sons of Louis the Fat were insensibly confounded with their maternal ancestors; and the new <PERSON>Courtenays</PERSON> might deserve to forfeit the honours of their birth, which a motive of interest had tempted them to renounce.
 3.
 The shame was far more permanent than the reward, and a momentary blaze was followed by a long darkness.
 The eldest son of these nuptials, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> of Courtenay, had married, as I have already mentioned, the sister of the counts of Flanders, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emperors of Constantinople: he rashly accepted the invitation of the barons of Romania; his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> and Baldwin, successively held and lost the remains of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> empire in the East, and the granddaughter of <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> again mingled her blood with the blood of <GPE>France</GPE> and of Valois.
 To support the expenses of a troubled and transitory reign, their patrimonial estates were mortgaged or sold: and the last emperors of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> depended on the <DATE>annual</DATE> charity of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Naples.
 While the elder brothers dissipated their wealth in romantic adventures, and the castle of <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> was profaned by a plebeian owner, the younger branches of that adopted name were propagated and multiplied.
 But their splendour was clouded by poverty and time: after the decease of Robert, great butler of France, they descended from princes to barons; the next generations were confounded with the simple gentry; the descendants of <PERSON>Hugh</PERSON> Capet could no longer be visible in the rural lords of <PERSON>Tanlay</PERSON> and of Champignelles.
 The more adventurous embraced without dishonour the profession of a soldier: the least active and opulent might sink, like their cousins of the branch of Dreux, into the condition of peasants.
 Their royal descent, in a dark period of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, became each day more obsolete and ambiguous; and their pedigree, instead of being enrolled in the annals of the kingdom, must be painfully searched by the minute diligence of heralds and genealogists.
 It was not till the end of the sixteenth century, on the accession of a family almost as remote as their own, that the princely spirit of the <PERSON>Courtenays</PERSON> again revived; and the question of the nobility provoked them to ascertain the royalty of their blood.
 They appealed to the justice and compassion of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Fourth; obtained a favourable opinion from <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> lawyers of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Germany, and modestly compared themselves to the descendants of King David, whose prerogatives were not impaired by the lapse of ages or the trade of a carpenter.
 (76) But every ear was deaf, and every circumstance was adverse, to their lawful claims.
 The <NORP>Bourbon</NORP> kings were justified by the neglect of the Valois; the princes of the blood, more recent and lofty, disdained the alliance of his humble kindred: the parliament, without denying their proofs, eluded a dangerous precedent by an arbitrary distinction, and established St.
 Louis as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> father of the royal line.
 (77) A repetition of complaints and protests was repeatedly disregarded; and the hopeless pursuit was terminated in the present century by the death of the last male of the family.
 (78) Their painful and anxious situation was alleviated by the pride of conscious virtue: they sternly rejected the temptations of fortune and favour; and a dying <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> would have sacrificed his son, if the youth could have renounced, for any temporal(79) interest, the right and title of a legitimate prince of the blood of France.
 <PERSON>III</PERSON> The <PERSON>Courtenays</PERSON> of England.
 According to the old register of Ford Abbey, the <PERSON>Courtenays</PERSON> of <GPE>Devonshire</GPE> are descended from Prince Florus, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son of Peter, and the grandson of Louis the Fat.
 (80) This fable of the grateful or venal monks was too respectfully entertained by our antiquaries, <PERSON>Cambden</PERSON> (81) and Dugdale: (82) but it is so clearly repugnant to truth and time, that the rational pride of the family now refuses to accept this imaginary founder.
 Their most faithful historians believe, that, after giving his daughter to the king's son, <PERSON>Reginald</PERSON> of <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> abandoned his possessions in France, and obtained from the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> monarch a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> wife and a new inheritance.
 It is certain, at least, that <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> distinguished in his camps and councils a Reginald, of the name and arms, and, as it may be fairly presumed, of the genuine race, of the <PERSON>Courtenays</PERSON> of France.
 The right of wardship enabled a feudal lord to reward his vassal with the marriage and estate of a noble heiress; and <PERSON>Reginald</PERSON> of <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> acquired a fair establishment in Devonshire, where his posterity has been seated above <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years.
 (83) From a <PERSON>Norman</PERSON> baron, <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> de Brioniis, who had been invested by the Conqueror, Hawise, the wife of Reginald, derived the honour of Okehampton, which was held by the service of <CARDINAL>ninety-three</CARDINAL> knights; and a female might claim the manly offices of hereditary viscount or sheriff, and of captain of the royal castle of Exeter.
 Their son <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> married the sister of the earl of Devon: at the end of a century, on the failure of the family of Rivers, (84) his great-grandson, <PERSON>Hugh</PERSON> the Second, succeeded to a title which was still considered as a territorial dignity; The earls of Devonshire.
 and <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> earls of Devonshire, of the name of Courtenay, have flourished in a period of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years.
 They were ranked among the chief of the barons of the realm; nor was it till after a strenuous dispute, that they yielded to the fief of <PERSON>Arundel</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> place in the parliament of England: their alliances were contracted with the noblest families, the Veres, Despensers, St.
 Johns, Talbots, Bohuns, and even the <ORG>Plantagenets</ORG> themselves; and in a contest with <PERSON>John</PERSON> of Lancaster, a Courtenay, bishop of London, and afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, might be accused of profane confidence in the strength and number of his kindred.
 In peace, the earls of <GPE>Devon</GPE> resided in their numerous castles and manors of the west; their ample revenue was appropriated to devotion and hospitality; and the epitaph of Edward, surnamed from his misfortune, the blind, from his virtues, the good, earl, inculcates with much ingenuity a moral sentence, which may, however, be abused by thoughtless generosity.
 After a grateful commemoration of the fifty-five years of union and happiness which he enjoyed with <PERSON>Mabel</PERSON> his wife, the good earl thus speaks from the tomb: —But their losses, in this sense, were far superior to their gifts and expenses; and their heirs, not less than the poor, were the objects of their paternal care.
 The sums which they paid for livery and seizin attest the greatness of their possessions; and several estates have remained in their family since the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.
 In war, the <PERSON>Courtenays</PERSON> of <GPE>England</GPE> fulfilled the duties, and deserved the honours, of chivalry.
 They were often intrusted to levy and command the militia of <GPE>Devonshire</GPE> and Cornwall; they often attended their supreme lord to the borders of Scotland; and in foreign service, for a stipulated price, they sometimes maintained fourscore men-at-arms and as many archers.
 By sea and land they fought under the standard of the <PERSON>Edwards</PERSON> and Henries: their names are conspicuous in battles, in tournaments, and in the original list of the Order of the Garter; <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> brothers shared the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> victory of the Black Prince; and in the lapse of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> generations, the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> <PERSON>Courtenays</PERSON> had learned to despise the nation and country from which they derived their origin.
 In the quarrel of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> roses, the earls of <GPE>Devon</GPE> adhered to the house of Lancaster; and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> brothers successively died either in the field or on the scaffold.
 Their honours and estates were restored by <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Seventh; a daughter of <PERSON>Edward</PERSON> the Fourth was not disgraced by the nuptials of a Courtenay; their son, who was created <PERSON>Marquis</PERSON> of Exeter, enjoyed the favour of his cousin <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Eighth; and in the camp of Cloth of Gold, he broke a lance against the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch.
 But the favour of <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> was the prelude of disgrace; his disgrace was the signal of death; and of the victims of the jealous tyrant, the marquis of <GPE>Exeter</GPE> is <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most noble and guiltless.
 His son <PERSON>Edward</PERSON> lived a prisoner in the Tower, and died in exile at Padua; and the secret love of Queen Mary, whom he slighted, perhaps for the princess Elizabeth, has shed a romantic colour on the story of this beautiful youth.
 The relics of his patrimony were conveyed into strange families by the marriages of his <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> aunts; and his personal honours, as if they had been legally extinct, were revived by the patents of succeeding princes.
 But there still survived a lineal descendant of Hugh, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> earl of Devon, a younger branch of the Courtenays, who have been seated at Powderham Castle above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, from the reign of <PERSON>Edward</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> to the present hour.
 Their estates have been increased by the grant and improvement of lands in Ireland, and they have been recently restored to the honours of the peerage.
 Yet the <PERSON>Courtenays</PERSON> still retain the plaintive motto, which asserts the innocence, and deplores the fall, of their ancient house.
 (86) While they sigh for past greatness, they are doubtless sensible of present blessings: in the long series of the <PERSON>Courtenay</PERSON> annals, the most splendid era is likewise the most unfortunate; nor can an opulent peer of <GPE>Britain</GPE> be inclined to envy the emperors of Constantinople, who wandered over <LOC>Europe</LOC> to solicit alms for the support of their dignity and the defence of their capital.
