 State and revolutions of Rome, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>1100-1500</CARDINAL> In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ages of the decline and fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, our eye is invariably fixed on the royal city, which had given laws to the fairest portion of the globe.
 We contemplate her fortunes, at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> with admiration, at length with pity, always with attention, and when that attention is diverted from the capital to the provinces, they are considered as so many branches which have been successively severed from the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> trunk.
 The foundation of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Rome, on the shores of the Bosphorus, has compelled the historian to follow the successors of Constantine; and our curiosity has been tempted to visit the most remote countries of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, to explore the causes and the authors of the long decay of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> monarchy.
 By the conquest of Justinian, we have been recalled to the banks of the Tyber, to the deliverance of the ancient metropolis; but that deliverance was a change, or perhaps an aggravation, of servitude.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> had been already stripped of her trophies, her gods, and her Caesars; nor was the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> dominion more inglorious and oppressive than the tyranny of the Greeks.
 In the eighth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aera, a religious quarrel, the worship of images, provoked the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to assert their independence: their bishop became the temporal, as well as the spiritual, father of a free people; and of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, which was restored by Charlemagne, the title and image still decorate the singular constitution of modern Germany.
 The name of <GPE>Rome</GPE> must yet command our involuntary respect: the climate (whatsoever may be its influence) was no longer the same: (1) the purity of blood had been contaminated through a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> channels; but the venerable aspect of her ruins, and the memory of past greatness, rekindled a spark of the national character.
 The darkness of the middle ages exhibits some scenes not unworthy of our notice.
 Nor shall I dismiss the present work till I have reviewed the state and revolutions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> City, which acquiesced under the absolute dominion of the popes, about the same time that <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was enslaved by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> arms.
 The <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>German</NORP> emperors of Rome, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>800-1100</CARDINAL> In the beginning of the twelfth century, (2) the aera of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade, <GPE>Rome</GPE> was revered by the Latins, as the metropolis of the world, as the throne of the pope and the emperor, who, from the eternal city, derived their title, their honours, and the right or exercise of temporal dominion.
 After so long an interruption, it may not be useless to repeat that the successors of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> and the <PERSON>Othos</PERSON> were chosen beyond the <ORG>Rhine</ORG> in a national diet; but that these princes were content with the humble names of kings of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Italy, till they had passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and the Apennine, to seek their <ORG>Imperial</ORG> crown on the banks of the Tyber.
 (3) At some distance from the city, their approach was saluted by a long procession of the clergy and people with palms and crosses; and the terrific emblems of wolves and lions, of dragons and eagles, that floated in the military banners, represented the departed legions and cohorts of the republic.
 The royal path to maintain the liberties of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was thrice reiterated, at the bridge, the gate, and on the stairs of the Vatican; and the distribution of a customary donative feebly imitated the magnificence of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Caesars.
 In the church of St.
 Peter, the coronation was performed by his successor: the voice of God was confounded with that of the people; and the public consent was declared in the acclamations of The names of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Augustus, the laws of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Justinian, the example of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> and Otho, established the supreme dominion of the emperors: their title and image was engraved on the papal coins; (5) and their jurisdiction was marked by the sword of justice, which they delivered to the praefect of the city.
 But every <NORP>Roman</NORP> prejudice was awakened by the name, the language, and the manners, of a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> lord.
 The <ORG>Caesars</ORG> of Saxony or <GPE>Franconia</GPE> were the chiefs of a feudal aristocracy; nor could they exercise the discipline of civil and military power, which alone secures the obedience of a distant people, impatient of servitude, though perhaps incapable of freedom.
 Once, and once only, in his life, each emperor, with an army of <NORP>Teutonic</NORP> vassals, descended from the Alps.
 I have described the peaceful order of his entry and coronation; but that order was commonly disturbed by the clamour and sedition of the Romans, who encountered their sovereign as a foreign invader: his departure was always speedy, and often shameful; and, in the absence of a long reign, his authority was insulted, and his name was forgotten.
 The progress of independence in <GPE>Germany</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> undermined the foundations of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> sovereignty, and the triumph of the popes was the deliverance of Rome.
 Authority of the popes in Rome, Of her <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sovereigns, the emperor had precariously reigned by the right of conquest; but the authority of the pope was founded on the soft, though more solid, basis of opinion and habit.
 The removal of a foreign influence restored and endeared the shepherd to his flock.
 Instead of the arbitrary or venal nomination of a <NORP>German</NORP> court, the vicar of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was freely chosen by the college of cardinals, most of whom were either natives or inhabitants of the city.
 from affection; The applause of the magistrates and people confirmed his election, and the ecclesiastical power that was obeyed in <GPE>Sweden</GPE> and <GPE>Britain</GPE> had been ultimately derived from the suffrage of the Romans.
 The same suffrage gave a prince, as well as a pontiff, to the capital.
 It was universally believed, that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had invested the popes with the temporal dominion of Rome; and the boldest civilians, the most profane skeptics, were satisfied with disputing the right of the emperor and the validity of his gift.
 The truth of the fact, the authenticity of his donation, was deeply rooted in the ignorance and tradition of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> centuries; and the fabulous origin was lost in the real and permanent effects.
 The name of <PERSON>Dominus</PERSON> or Lord was inscribed on the coin of the bishops: right; their title was acknowledged by acclamations and oaths of allegiance, and with the free, or reluctant, consent of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars, they had long exercised a supreme or subordinate jurisdiction over the city and patrimony of St.
 Peter.
 The reign of the popes, which gratified the prejudices, was not incompatible with the liberties, of Rome; and a more critical inquiry would have revealed a still nobler source of their power; the gratitude of a nation, whom they had rescued from the heresy and oppression of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant.
 In an age of superstition, it should seem that the union of the royal and sacerdotal characters would mutually fortify each other; and that the keys of <LOC>Paradise</LOC> would be the surest pledge of earthly obedience.
 The sanctity of the office might indeed be degraded by the personal vices of the man.
 virtue; But the scandals of the tenth century were obliterated by the austere and more dangerous virtues of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> and his successors; and in the ambitious contests which they maintained for the rights of the church, their sufferings or their success must equally tend to increase the popular veneration.
 They sometimes wandered in poverty and exile, the victims of persecution; and the apostolic zeal with which they offered themselves to martyrdom must engage the favour and sympathy of every <NORP>Catholic</NORP> breast.
 And sometimes, thundering from the Vatican, they created, judged, and deposed the kings of the world; nor could the proudest <NORP>Roman</NORP> be disgraced by submitting to a priest, whose feet were kissed, and whose stirrup was held, by the successors of Charlemagne.
 (6) Even the temporal interest of the city should have protected in peace and honour the residence of the popes; from whence a vain and lazy people derived the greatest part of their subsistence and riches.
 benefits; The fixed revenue of the popes was probably impaired; many of the old patrimonial estates, both in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces, had been invaded by sacrilegious hands; nor could the loss be compensated by the claim, rather than the possession, of the more ample gifts of <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> and his descendants.
 But the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and <FAC>Capitol</FAC> were nourished by the incessant and increasing swarms of pilgrims and suppliants: the pale of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was enlarged, and the pope and cardinals were overwhelmed by the judgment of ecclesiastical and secular causes.
 A new jurisprudence had established in the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church the right and practice of appeals; (7) and from the <LOC>North</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> the bishops and abbots were invited or summoned to solicit, to complain, to accuse, or to justify, before the threshold of the apostles.
 A rare prodigy is once recorded, that <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> horses, belonging to the archbishops of <ORG>Mentz</ORG> and Cologne, repassed the Alps, yet laden with gold and silver: (8) but it was soon understood, that the success, both of the pilgrims and clients, depended much less on the justice of their cause than on the value of their offering.
 The wealth and piety of these strangers were ostentatiously displayed; and their expenses, sacred or profane, circulated in various channels for the emolument of the Romans.
 Inconstancy of superstition.
 Such powerful motives should have firmly attached the voluntary and pious obedience of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people to their spiritual and temporal father.
 But the operation of prejudice and interest is often disturbed by the sallies of ungovernable passion.
 The <NORP>Indian</NORP> who fells the tree, that he may gather the fruit, (9) and the <NORP>Arab</NORP> who plunders the caravans of commerce, are actuated by the same impulse of savage nature, which overlooks the future in the present, and relinquishes for momentary rapine the long and secure possession of the most important blessings.
 And it was thus, that the shrine of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> was profaned by the thoughtless Romans; who pillaged the offerings, and wounded the pilgrims, without computing the number and value of similar visits, which they prevented by their inhospitable sacrilege.
 Even the influence of superstition is fluctuating and precarious; and the slave, whose reason is subdued, will often be delivered by his avarice or pride.
 A credulous devotion for the fables and oracles of the priesthood most powerfully acts on the mind of a Barbarian; yet such a mind is the least capable of preferring imagination to sense, of sacrificing to a distant motive, to an invisible, perhaps an ideal, object, the appetites and interests of the present world.
 In the vigour of health and youth, his practice will perpetually contradict his belief; till the pressure of age, or sickness, or calamity, awakens his terrors, and compels him to satisfy the double debt of piety and remorse.
 I have already observed, that the modern times of religious indifference are the most favourable to the peace and security of the clergy.
 Under the reign of superstition, they had much to hope from the ignorance, and much to fear from the violence, of mankind.
 The wealth, whose constant increase must have rendered them the sole proprietors of the earth, was alternately bestowed by the repentant father and plundered by the rapacious son: their persons were adored or violated; and the same idol, by the hands of the same votaries, was placed on the altar, or trampled in the dust.
 In the feudal system of Europe, arms were the title of distinction and the measure of allegiance; and amidst their tumult, the still voice of law and reason was seldom heard or obeyed.
 Seditions against the popes.
 The turbulent <NORP>Romans</NORP> disdained the yoke, and insulted the impotence, of their bishop:(10) nor would his education or character allow him to exercise, with decency or effect, the power of the sword.
 The motives of his election and the frailties of his life were exposed to their familiar observation; and proximity must diminish the reverence which his name and his decrees impressed on a barbarous world.
 This difference has not escaped the notice of our philosophic historian: Successors of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> VII.
 A.
D.
 1086-1305.
 Since the primitive times, the wealth of the popes was exposed to envy, their powers to opposition, and their persons to violence.
 But the long hostility of the mitre and the crown increased the numbers, and inflamed the passions, of their enemies.
 The deadly factions of the <PERSON>Guelphs</PERSON> and Ghibelines, so fatal to Italy, could never be embraced with truth or constancy by the Romans, the subjects and adversaries both of the bishop and emperor; but their support was solicited by both parties, and they alternately displayed in their banners the keys of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and the <NORP>German</NORP> eagle.
 <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, who may be adored or detested as the founder of the papal monarchy, was driven from Rome, and died in exile at Salerno.
 Six- and-thirty of his successors, (12) till their retreat to Avignon, maintained an unequal contest with the Romans: their age and dignity were often violated; and the churches, in the solemn rites of religion, were polluted with sedition and murder.
 A repetition (13) of such capricious brutality, without connection or design, would be tedious and disgusting; and I shall content myself with some events of the twelfth century, which represent the state of the popes and the city.
 <PERSON>Paschal</PERSON> II.
 A.
D.
 1099-1118 On Holy Thursday, while <PERSON>Paschal</PERSON> officiated before the altar, he was interrupted by the clamours of the multitude, who imperiously demanded the confirmation of a favourite magistrate.
 His silence exasperated their fury; his pious refusal to mingle the affairs of earth and heaven was encountered with menaces, and oaths, that he should be the cause and the witness of the public ruin.
 During the festival of Easter, while the bishop and the clergy, barefooted and in procession, visited the tombs of the martyrs, they were twice assaulted, at the bridge of St.
 Angelo, and before the Capitol, with volleys of stones and darts.
 The houses of his adherents were levelled with the ground: <PERSON>Paschal</PERSON> escaped with difficulty and danger; he levied an army in the patrimony of St.
 Peter; and his last days were embittered by suffering and inflicting the calamities of civil war.
 <PERSON>Gelasius</PERSON> II.
 A.
D.
 1118-1119 The scenes that followed the election of his successor <PERSON>Gelasius</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> were still more scandalous to the church and city.
 <PERSON>Cencio</PERSON> Frangipani, (14) a potent and factious baron, burst into the assembly furious and in arms: the cardinals were stripped, beaten, and trampled under foot; and he seized, without pity or respect, the vicar of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> by the throat.
 <PERSON>Gelasius</PERSON> was dragged by the hair along the ground, buffeted with blows, wounded with spurs, and bound with an iron chain in the house of his brutal tyrant.
 An insurrection of the people delivered their bishop: the rival families opposed the violence of the Frangipani; and Cencio, who sued for pardon, repented of the failure, rather than of the guilt, of his enterprise.
 Not many days had elapsed, when the pope was again assaulted at the altar.
 While his friends and enemies were engaged in a bloody contest, he escaped in his sacerdotal garments.
 In this unworthy flight, which excited the compassion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> matrons, his attendants were scattered or unhorsed; and, in the fields behind the church of St.
 Peter, his successor was found alone and <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> dead with fear and fatigue.
 Shaking the dust from his feet, the apostle withdrew from a city in which his dignity was insulted and his person was endangered; and the vanity of sacerdotal ambition is revealed in the involuntary confession, that <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> emperor was more tolerable than twenty.
 (15) These examples might suffice; but I cannot forget the sufferings of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> pontiffs of the same age, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the name of Lucius.
 <PERSON>Lucius</PERSON> II.
 A.
D.
 1144,1145.
 The former, as he ascended in battle array to assault the Capitol, was struck on the temple by a stone, and expired in a few days.
 <PERSON>Lucius</PERSON> III.
 A.
D.
 1181-1185.
 The latter was severely wounded in the person of his servants.
 In a civil commotion, several of his priests had been made prisoners; and the inhuman Romans, reserving <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> as a guide for his brethren, put out their eyes, crowned them with ludicrous mitres, mounted them on asses with their faces towards the tail, and extorted an oath, that, in this wretched condition, they should offer themselves as a lesson to the head of the church.
 Hope or fear, lassitude or remorse, the characters of the men, and the circumstances of the times, might sometimes obtain an interval of peace and obedience; and the pope was restored with joyful acclamations to the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> or Vatican, from whence he had been driven with threats and violence.
 But the root of mischief was deep and perennial; and a momentary calm was preceded and followed by such tempests as had almost sunk the bark of St.
 Peter.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> continually presented the aspect of war and discord: the churches and palaces were fortified and assaulted by the factions and families; <PERSON>Calistus</PERSON> II.
 A.
D.
 1119-1124.
 and, after giving peace to Europe, <PERSON>Calistus</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> alone had resolution and power to prohibit the use of private arms in the metropolis.
 Among the nations who revered the apostolic throne, the tumults of <GPE>Rome</GPE> provoked a general indignation; Innocent II.
 A.
D.
 1130-1143.
 and in a letter to his disciple <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> the Third, St.
 Bernard, with the sharpness of his wit and zeal, has stigmatized the vices of the rebellious people.
 (16)Character of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by St.
 Bernard.
Surely this dark portrait is not coloured by the pencil of <NORP>Christian</NORP> charity; (17) yet the features, however harsh or ugly, express a lively resemblance of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> of the twelfth century.
 (18) Political heresy of <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> of Brescia, A.
D.
 1140.
 The <NORP>Jews</NORP> had rejected the <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> when he appeared among them in a plebeian character; and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might plead their ignorance of his vicar when he assumed the pomp and pride of a temporal sovereign.
 In the busy age of the crusades, some sparks of curiosity and reason were rekindled in the <NORP>Western</NORP> world: the heresy of Bulgaria, the <NORP>Paulician</NORP> sect, was successfully transplanted into the soil of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and France; the <NORP>Gnostic</NORP> visions were mingled with the simplicity of the gospel; and the enemies of the clergy reconciled their passions with their conscience, the desire of freedom with the profession of piety.
 (19) The trumpet of <NORP>Roman</NORP> liberty was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> sounded by <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> of Brescia, (20) whose promotion in the church was confined to the lowest rank, and who wore the monastic habit rather as a garb of poverty than as a uniform of obedience.
 His adversaries could not deny the wit and eloquence which they severely felt; they confess with reluctance the specious purity of his morals; and his errors were recommended to the public by a mixture of important and beneficial truths.
 In his theological studies, he had been the disciple of the famous and unfortunate Abelard, (21) who was likewise involved in the suspicion of heresy: but the lover of <PERSON>Eloisa</PERSON> was of a soft and flexible nature; and his ecclesiastic judges were edified and disarmed by the humility of his repentance.
 From this master, <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> most probably imbibed some metaphysical definitions of the Trinity, repugnant to the taste of the times: his ideas of baptism and the eucharist are loosely censured; but a political heresy was the source of his fame and misfortunes.
 He presumed to quote the declaration of Christ, that his kingdom is not of this world: he boldly maintained, that the sword and the sceptre were intrusted to the civil magistrate; that temporal honours and possessions were lawfully vested in secular persons; that the abbots, the bishops, and the pope himself, must renounce either their state or their salvation; and that after the loss of their revenues, the voluntary tithes and oblations of the faithful would suffice, not indeed for luxury and avarice, but for a frugal life in the exercise of spiritual labours.
 During a short time, the preacher was revered as a patriot; and the discontent, or revolt, of <GPE>Brescia</GPE> against her bishop, was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fruits of his dangerous lessons.
 But the favour of the people is less permanent than the resentment of the priest; and after the heresy of <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> had been condemned by Innocent the Second, (22) in the general council of the Lateran, the magistrates themselves were urged by prejudice and fear to execute the sentence of the church.
 <GPE>Italy</GPE> could no longer afford a refuge; and the disciple of <PERSON>Abelard</PERSON> escaped beyond the Alps, till he found a safe and hospitable shelter in Zurich, now the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Swiss</NORP> cantons.
 From a <NORP>Roman</NORP> station, (23) a royal villa, a chapter of noble virgins, <GPE>Zurich</GPE> had gradually increased to a free and flourishing city; where the appeals of the <NORP>Milanese</NORP> were sometimes tried by the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> commissaries.
 (24) In an age less ripe for reformation, the precursor of <PERSON>Zuinglius</PERSON> was heard with applause: a brave and simple people imbibed, and long retained, the colour of his opinions; and his art, or merit, seduced the bishop of Constance, and even the pope's legate, who forgot, for his sake, the interest of their master and their order.
 Their tardy zeal was quickened by the fierce exhortations of St.
 Bernard; (25) and the enemy of the church was driven by persecution to the desperate measures of erecting his standard in <GPE>Rome</GPE> itself, in the face of the successor of St.
 Peter.
 He exhorts the romans to restore the republic.
 A.
D.
 1144-1154.
 Yet the courage of <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> was not devoid of discretion: he was protected, and had perhaps been invited, by the nobles and people; and in the service of freedom, his eloquence thundered over the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hills.
 Blending in the same discourse the texts of <PERSON>Livy</PERSON> and St.
 Paul, uniting the motives of gospel, and of classic, enthusiasm, he admonished the Romans, how strangely their patience and the vices of the clergy had degenerated from the primitive times of the church and the city.
 He exhorted them to assert the inalienable rights of men and Christians; to restore the laws and magistrates of the republic; to respect the name of the emperor; but to confine their shepherd to the spiritual government of his flock.
 (26) Nor could his spiritual government escape the censure and control of the reformer; and the inferior clergy were taught by his lessons to resist the cardinals, who had usurped a despotic command over the <CARDINAL>twenty-eight</CARDINAL> regions or parishes of Rome.
 (27) The revolution was not accomplished without rapine and violence, the diffusion of blood and the demolition of houses: the victorious faction was enriched with the spoils of the clergy and the adverse nobles.
 <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> of <GPE>Brescia</GPE> enjoyed, or deplored, the effects of his mission: his reign continued above <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years, while <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> popes, Innocent the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> and <NORP>Anastasius</NORP> the Fourth, either trembled in the Vatican, or wandered as exiles in the adjacent cities.
 They were succeeded by a more vigorous and fortunate pontiff.
 <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> the Fourth, (28) the only <NORP>Englishman</NORP> who has ascended the throne of St.
 Peter; and whose merit emerged from the mean condition of a monk, and almost a beggar, in the monastery of St.
 Albans.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> provocation, of a cardinal killed or wounded in the streets, he cast an interdict on the guilty people; and from Christmas to Easter, <GPE>Rome</GPE> was deprived of the real or imaginary comforts of religious worship.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> had despised their temporal prince: they submitted with grief and terror to the censures of their spiritual father: their guilt was expiated by penance, and the banishment of the seditious preacher was the price of their absolution.
 But the revenge of <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> was yet unsatisfied, and the approaching coronation of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa was fatal to the bold reformer, who had offended, though not in an equal degree, the heads of the church and state.
 In their interview at Viterbo, the pope represented to the emperor the furious, ungovernable spirit of the Romans; the insults, the injuries, the fears, to which his person and his clergy were continually exposed; and the pernicious tendency of the heresy of Arnold, which must subvert the principles of civil, as well as ecclesiastical, subordination.
 <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> was convinced by these arguments, or tempted by the desire of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> crown: in the balance of ambition, the innocence or life of an individual is of small account; and their common enemy was sacrificed to a moment of political concord.
 After his retreat from Rome, <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> had been protected by the viscounts of Campania, from whom he was extorted by the power of Caesar: the praefect of the city pronounced his sentence: His execution, A.
D.
 1155.
 the martyr of freedom was burned alive in the presence of a careless and ungrateful people; and his ashes were cast into the Tyber, lest the heretics should collect and worship the relics of their master.
 (29) The clergy triumphed in his death: with his ashes, his sect was dispersed; his memory still lived in the minds of the Romans.
 From his school they had probably derived a new article of faith, that the metropolis of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church is exempt from the penalties of excommunication and interdict.
 Their bishops might argue, that the supreme jurisdiction, which they exercised over kings and nations, more especially embraced the city and diocese of the prince of the apostles.
 But they preached to the winds, and the same principle that weakened the effect, must temper the abuse, of the thunders of the Vatican.
 Restoration of the senate, A.
D.
 1144.
 The love of ancient freedom has encouraged a belief that as early as the tenth century, in their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> struggles against the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> Othos, the commonwealth was vindicated and restored by the senate and people of Rome; that <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> consuls were annually elected among the nobles, and that <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> plebeian magistrates revived the name and office of the tribunes of the commons.
 (30) But this venerable structure disappears before the light of criticism.
 In the darkness of the middle ages, the appellations of senators, of consuls, of the sons of consuls, may sometimes be discovered.
 (31) They were bestowed by the emperors, or assumed by the most powerful citizens, to denote their rank, their honours, (32) and perhaps the claim of a pure and patrician descent: but they float on the surface, without a series or a substance, the titles of men, not the orders of government; (33) and it is only from the year of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and forty-four that the establishment of the senate is dated, as a glorious aera, in the acts of the city.
 A new constitution was hastily framed by private ambition or popular enthusiasm; nor could Rome, in the twelfth century, produce an antiquary to explain, or a legislator to restore, the harmony and proportions of the ancient model.
 The assembly of a free, of an armed, people, will ever speak in loud and weighty acclamations.
 But the regular distribution of the <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> tribes, the nice balance of the wealth and numbers of the centuries, the debates of the adverse orators, and the slow operations of votes and ballots, could not easily be adapted by a blind multitude, ignorant of the arts, and insensible of the benefits, of legal government.
 It was proposed by <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> to revive and discriminate the equestrian order; but what could be the motive or measure of such distinction? (34) The pecuniary qualification of the knights must have been reduced to the poverty of the times: those times no longer required their civil functions of judges and farmers of the revenue; and their primitive duty, their military service on horseback, was more nobly supplied by feudal tenures and the spirit of chivalry.
 The jurisprudence of the republic was useless and unknown: the nations and families of <GPE>Italy</GPE> who lived under the <NORP>Roman</NORP> and <NORP>Barbaric</NORP> laws were insensibly mingled in a common mass; and some faint tradition, some imperfect fragments, preserved the memory of the <LAW>Code</LAW> and Pandects of Justinian.
 With their liberty the <NORP>Romans</NORP> might doubtless have restored the appellation and office of consuls; had they not disdained a title so promiscuously adopted in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> cities, that it has finally settled on the humble station of the agents of commerce in a foreign land.
 But the rights of the tribunes, the formidable word that arrested the public counsels, suppose or must produce a legitimate democracy.
 The old patricians were the subjects, the modern barons the tyrants, of the state; nor would the enemies of peace and order, who insulted the vicar of Christ, have long respected the unarmed sanctity of a plebeian magistrate.
 (35) The Capitol.
 In the revolution of the twelfth century, which gave a new existence and aera to Rome, we may observe the real and important events that marked or confirmed her political independence.
 I.
 The Capitoline hill, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of her <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> eminences, (36) is about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> yards in length, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> in breadth.
 A flight of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> steps led to the summit of the <NORP>Tarpeian</NORP> rock; and far steeper was the ascent before the declivities had been smoothed and the precipices filled by the ruins of fallen edifices.
 From the earliest ages, the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> had been used as a temple in peace, a fortress in war: after the loss of the city, it maintained a siege against the victorious Gauls, and the sanctuary of the empire was occupied, assaulted, and burnt, in the civil wars of <GPE>Vitellius</GPE> and Vespasian.
 (37) The temples of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> and his kindred deities had crumbled into dust; their place was supplied by monasteries and houses; and the solid walls, the long and shelving porticos, were decayed or ruined by the lapse of time.
 It was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> act of the Romans, an act of freedom, to restore the strength, though not the beauty, of the Capitol; to fortify the seat of their arms and counsels; and as often as they ascended the hill, the coldest minds must have glowed with the remembrance of their ancestors.

 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> had been invested with the exclusive coinage of the gold and silver; to the senate they abandoned the baser metal of bronze or copper: (38) the emblems and legends were inscribed on a more ample field by the genius of flattery; and the prince was relieved from the care of celebrating his own virtues.
 The successors of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> despised even the flattery of the senate: their royal officers at Rome, and in the provinces, assumed the sole direction of the mint; and the same prerogative was inherited by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kings of Italy, and the long series of the Greek, the French, and the <NORP>German</NORP> dynasties.
 After an abdication of eight <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate asserted this honourable and lucrative privilege; which was tacitly renounced by the popes, from <PERSON>Paschal</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> to the establishment of their residence beyond the Alps.
 Some of these <NORP>republican</NORP> coins of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are shown in the cabinets of the curious.
 On <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these, a gold medal, <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> is depictured holding in his left hand a book with this inscription: "THE VOW OF THE ROMAN SENATE AND PEOPLE: ROME THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD;" on the reverse, St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> delivering a banner to a kneeling senator in his cap and gown, with the name and arms of his family impressed on a shield.
 (39) The praefect of the city.
 III.
 With the empire, the praefect of the city had declined to a municipal officer; yet he still exercised in the last appeal the civil and criminal jurisdiction; and a drawn sword, which he received from the successors of Otho, was the mode of his investiture and the emblem of his functions.
 (40) The dignity was confined to the noble families of Rome: the choice of the people was ratified by the pope; but a triple oath of fidelity must have often embarrassed the praefect in the conflict of adverse duties.
 (41) A servant, in whom they possessed but a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> share, was dismissed by the independent Romans: in his place they elected a patrician; but this title, which <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> had not disdained, was too lofty for a citizen or a subject; A.
D.
 1198-1216.
 and, after the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervour of rebellion, they consented without reluctance to the restoration of the praefect.
 About <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years after this event, Innocent the Third, the most ambitious, or at least the most fortunate, of the Pontiffs, delivered the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and himself from this badge of foreign dominion: he invested the praefect with a banner instead of a sword, and absolved him from all dependence of oaths or service to the <NORP>German</NORP> emperors.
 (42) In his place an ecclesiastic, a present or future cardinal, was named by the pope to the civil government of Rome; but his jurisdiction has been reduced to a narrow compass; and in the days of freedom, the right or exercise was derived from the senate and people.
 Number and choice of the senate.
 IV.
 After the revival of the senate, (43) the conscript fathers (if I may use the expression) were invested with the legislative and executive power; but their views seldom reached beyond the present day; and that day was most frequently disturbed by violence and tumult.
 In its utmost plenitude, the order or assembly consisted of <CARDINAL>fifty-six</CARDINAL> senators, (44) the most eminent of whom were distinguished by the title of counsellors: they were nominated, perhaps annually, by the people; and a previous choice of their electors, <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> persons in each region, or parish, might afford a basis for a free and permanent constitution.
 The popes, who in this tempest submitted rather to bend than to break, confirmed by treaty the establishment and privileges of the senate, and expected from time, peace, and religion, the restoration of their government.
 The motives of public and private interest might sometimes draw from the <NORP>Romans</NORP> an occasional and temporary sacrifice of their claims; and they renewed their oath of allegiance to the successor of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and Constantine, the lawful head of the church and the republic.
 (45) The office of senator.
 The union and vigour of a public council was dissolved in a lawless city; and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> soon adopted a more strong and simple mode of administration.
 They condensed the name and authority of the senate in a single magistrate, or <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> colleagues; and as they were changed at the end of a year, or of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months, the greatness of the trust was compensated by the shortness of the term.
 But in this transient reign, the senators of <GPE>Rome</GPE> indulged their avarice and ambition: their justice was perverted by the interest of their family and faction; and as they punished only their enemies, they were obeyed only by their adherents.
 Anarchy, no longer tempered by the pastoral care of their bishop, admonished the <NORP>Romans</NORP> that they were incapable of governing themselves; and they sought abroad those blessings which they were hopeless of finding at home.
 In the same age, and from the same motives, most of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> republics were prompted to embrace a measure, which, however strange it may seem, was adapted to their situation, and productive of the most salutary effects.
 (46) They chose, in some foreign but friendly city, an impartial magistrate of noble birth and unblemished character, a soldier and a statesman, recommended by the voice of fame and his country, to whom they delegated for a time the supreme administration of peace and war.
 The compact between the governor and the governed was sealed with oaths and subscriptions; and the duration of his power, the measure of his stipend, the nature of their mutual obligations, were defined with scrupulous precision.
 They swore to obey him as their lawful superior: he pledged his faith to unite the indifference of a stranger with the zeal of a patriot.
 At his choice, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> knights and civilians, his assessors in arms and justice, attended the Podesta, (47) who maintained at his own expense a decent retinue of servants and horses: his wife, his son, his brother, who might bias the affections of the judge, were left behind: during the exercise of his office he was not permitted to purchase land, to contract an alliance, or even to accept an invitation in the house of a citizen; nor could he honourably depart till he had satisfied the complaints that might be urged against his government.
 Brancaleone, A.
D.
 1252-1258.
 It was thus, about the middle of the thirteenth century, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> called from <PERSON>Bologna</PERSON> the senator Brancaleone, (48) whose fame and merit have been rescued from oblivion by the pen of an <NORP>English</NORP> historian.
 A just anxiety for his reputation, a clear foresight of the difficulties of the task, had engaged him to refuse the honour of their choice: the statutes of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were suspended, and his office prolonged to the term of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years.
 By the guilty and licentious he was accused as cruel; by the clergy he was suspected as partial; but the friends of peace and order applauded the firm and upright magistrate by whom those blessings were restored.
 No criminals were so powerful as to brave, so obscure as to elude, the justice of the senator.
 By his sentence <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nobles of the <PERSON>Annibaldi</PERSON> family were executed on a gibbet; and he inexorably demolished, in the city and neighbourhood, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and forty towers, the strong shelters of rapine and mischief.
 The bishop, as a simple bishop, was compelled to reside in his diocese; and the standard of <PERSON>Brancaleone</PERSON> was displayed in the field with terror and effect.
 His services were repaid by the ingratitude of a people unworthy of the happiness which they enjoyed.
 By the public robbers, whom he had provoked for their sake, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were excited to depose and imprison their benefactor; nor would his life have been spared, if <PERSON>Bologna</PERSON> had not possessed a pledge for his safety.
 Before his departure, the prudent senator had required the exchange of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> hostages of the noblest families of Rome: on the news of his danger, and at the prayer of his wife, they were more strictly guarded; and Bologna, in the cause of honour, sustained the thunders of a papal interdict.
 This generous resistance allowed the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to compare the present with the past; and <PERSON>Brancaleone</PERSON> was conducted from the prison to the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> amidst the acclamations of a repentant people.
 The remainder of his government was firm and fortunate; and as soon as envy was appeased by death, his head, enclosed in a precious vase, was deposited on a lofty column of marble.
 (49) <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> of Anjou, A.
D.
 1265-1278.
 The impotence of reason and virtue recommended in <GPE>Italy</GPE> a more effectual choice: instead of a private citizen, to whom they yielded a voluntary and precarious obedience, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> elected for their senator some prince of independent power, who could defend them from their enemies and themselves.
 <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> of <GPE>Anjou</GPE> and Provence, the most ambitious and warlike monarch of the age, accepted at the same time the kingdom of <GPE>Naples</GPE> from the pope, and the office of senator from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 (50) As he passed through the city, in his road to victory, he received their oath of allegiance, lodged in the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> palace, and smoothed in a short visit the harsh features of his despotic character.
 Yet even <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> was exposed to the inconstancy of the people, who saluted with the same acclamations the passage of his rival, the unfortunate Conradin; and a powerful avenger, who reigned in the Capitol, alarmed the fears and jealousy of the popes.
 The absolute term of his life was superseded by a renewal every <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> year; and the enmity of <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> obliged the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> king to abdicate the government of Rome.
 In his bull, a perpetual law, the imperious pontiff asserts the truth, validity, and use of the donation of Constantine, not less essential to the peace of the city than to the independence of the church; establishes the annual election of the senator; and formally disqualifies all emperors, kings, princes, and persons of an eminent and conspicuous rank.
 (51) <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> IV.
 A.
D.
 1281.
 This prohibitory clause was repealed in his own behalf by <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> the Fourth, who humbly solicited the suffrage of the Romans.
 In the presence, and by the authority, of the people, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> electors conferred, not on the pope, but on the noble and faithful Martin, the dignity of senator, and the supreme administration of the republic, (52) to hold during his natural life, and to exercise at pleasure by himself or his deputies.
 The emperor <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> of Bavaria, A.
D.
 1328.
 About <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years afterwards, the same title was granted to the emperor <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> of Bavaria; and the liberty of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was acknowledged by her <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sovereigns, who accepted a municipal office in the government of their own metropolis.
 Addresses of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to the emperors.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> moments of rebellion, when <PERSON>Arnold</PERSON> of <GPE>Brescia</GPE> had inflamed their minds against the church, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> artfully labored to conciliate the favour of the empire, and to recommend their merit and services in the cause of Caesar.
 <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> III.
 A.
D.
 1144.
 The style of their ambassadors to <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> and <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> is a mixture of flattery and pride, the tradition and the ignorance of their own history.
 (53) After some complaint of his silence and neglect, they exhort the former of these princes to pass the Alps, and assume from their hands the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> crown.
 But these splendid and fallacious wishes were not cherished by <PERSON>Conrad</PERSON> the Franconian, whose eyes were fixed on the Holy Land, and who died without visiting <GPE>Rome</GPE> soon after his return from the Holy Land.
 <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> I.
 A.
D.
 1155.
 His nephew and successor, <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa, was more ambitious of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> crown; nor had any of the successors of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> acquired such absolute sway over the kingdom of Italy.
 Surrounded by his ecclesiastical and secular princes, he gave audience in his camp at <GPE>Sutri</GPE> to the ambassadors of Rome, who thus addressed him in a free and florid oration: The flowers of <NORP>Latin</NORP> rhetoric were not yet exhausted; but Frederic, impatient of their vanity, interrupted the orators in the high tone of royalty and conquest.
 Neither the emperor nor the senate could maintain these lofty pretensions of dominion and liberty.
 United with the pope, and suspicious of the Romans, <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> continued his march to the Vatican; his coronation was disturbed by a sally from the Capitol; and if the numbers and valour of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> prevailed in the bloody conflict, he could not safely encamp in the presence of a city of which he styled himself the sovereign.
 About <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years afterwards, he besieged Rome, to seat an antipope in the chair of St.
 Peter; and <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <NORP>Pisan</NORP> galleys were introduced into the Tyber: but the senate and people were saved by the arts of negotiation and the progress of disease; nor did <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> or his successors reiterate the hostile attempt.
 Their laborious reigns were exercised by the popes, the crusades, and the independence of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> and Germany: they courted the alliance of the Romans; and <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> offered in the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> the great standard, the <PERSON>Caroccio</PERSON> of Milan.
 (60) After the extinction of the house of Swabia, they were banished beyond the Alps: and their last coronations betrayed the impotence and poverty of the <NORP>Teutonic</NORP> Caesars.
 (61) Wars of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> against the neighbouring cities.
 Under the reign of Adrian, when the empire extended from the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> to the ocean, from Mount Atlas to the Grampian hills, a fanciful historian (62) amused the <NORP>Romans</NORP> with the picture of their ancient wars.
 The pride of his contemporaries was gratified by the contrast of the past and the present: they would have been humbled by the prospect of futurity; by the prediction, that after a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years, Rome, despoiled of empire, and contracted to her primaeval limits, would renew the same hostilities, on the same ground which was then decorated with her villas and gardens.
 The adjacent territory on either side of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> was always claimed, and sometimes possessed, as the patrimony of St.
 Peter; but the barons assumed a lawless independence, and the cities too faithfully copied the revolt and discord of the metropolis.
 In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the <NORP>Romans</NORP> incessantly laboured to reduce or destroy the contumacious vassals of the church and senate; and if their headstrong and selfish ambition was moderated by the pope, he often encouraged their zeal by the alliance of his spiritual arms.
 Their warfare was that of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> consuls and dictators, who were taken from the plough.
 The assembled in arms at the foot of the Capitol; sallied from the gates, plundered or burnt the harvests of their neighbours, engaged in tumultuary conflict, and returned home after an expedition of fifteen or <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> days.
 Their sieges were tedious and unskilful: in the use of victory, they indulged the meaner passions of jealousy and revenge; and instead of adopting the valour, they trampled on the misfortunes, of their adversaries.
 The captives, in their shirts, with a rope round their necks, solicited their pardon: the fortifications, and even the buildings, of the rival cities, were demolished, and the inhabitants were scattered in the adjacent villages.
 It was thus that the seats of the cardinal bishops, Porto, Ostia, Albanum, Tusculum, Praeneste, and <GPE>Tibur</GPE> or Tivoli, were successively overthrown by the ferocious hostility of the Romans.
 (63) Of these, (64) <GPE>Porto</GPE> and Ostia, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> keys of the Tyber, are still vacant and desolate: the marshy and unwholesome banks are peopled with herds of buffaloes, and the river is lost to every purpose of navigation and trade.
 The hills, which afford a shady retirement from the autumnal heats, have again smiled with the blessings of peace; <GPE>Frescati</GPE> has arisen near the ruins of Tusculum; <GPE>Tibur</GPE> or <GPE>Tivoli</GPE> has resumed the honours of a city, (65) and the meaner towns of <GPE>Albano</GPE> and <GPE>Palestrina</GPE> are decorated with the villas of the cardinals and princes of Rome.
 In the work of destruction, the ambition of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was often checked and repulsed by the neighbouring cities and their allies: in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> siege of Tibur, they were driven from their camp; Battle of Tusculum, A.
D.
 1167.
 and the battles of <NORP>Tusculum</NORP> (66) and <GPE>Viterbo</GPE> (67) might be compared in their relative state to the memorable fields of <GPE>Thrasymene</GPE> and Cannae.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these petty wars, <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Romans</NORP> were overthrown by a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>German</NORP> horse, whom <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> Barbarossa had detached to the relief of Tusculum: and if we number the slain at three, the prisoners at two, thousand, we shall embrace the most authentic and moderate account.
 Battle of Viterbo, A.
D.
 1234.
 Sixty-eight years afterwards they marched against <GPE>Viterbo</GPE> in the ecclesiastical state with the whole force of the city; by a rare coalition the <NORP>Teutonic</NORP> eagle was blended, in the adverse banners, with the keys of St.
 Peter; and the pope's auxiliaries were commanded by a count of <ORG>Thoulouse</ORG> and a bishop of Winchester.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> were discomfited with shame and slaughter: but the <NORP>English</NORP> prelate must have indulged the vanity of a pilgrim, if he multiplied their numbers to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred, and their loss in the field to thirty, <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men.
 Had the policy of the senate and the discipline of the legions been restored with the Capitol, the divided condition of <GPE>Italy</GPE> would have offered the fairest opportunity of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> conquest.
 But in arms, the modern <NORP>Romans</NORP> were not above, and in arts, they were far below, the common level of the neighbouring republics.
 Nor was their warlike spirit of any long continuance; after some irregular sallies, they subsided in the national apathy, in the neglect of military institutions, and in the disgraceful and dangerous use of foreign mercenaries.
 The election of the popes.
 Ambition is a weed of quick and early vegetation in the vineyard of Christ.
 Under the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes, the chair of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> was disputed by the votes, the venality, the violence, of a popular election: the sanctuaries of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were polluted with blood; and, from the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> to the twelfth century, the church was distracted by the mischief of frequent schisms.
 As long as the final appeal was determined by the civil magistrate, these mischiefs were transient and local: the merits were tried by equity or favour; nor could the unsuccessful competitor long disturb the triumph of his rival.
 But after the emperors had been divested of their prerogatives, after a maxim had been established that the vicar of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> is amenable to no earthly tribunal, each vacancy of the holy see might involve <NORP>Christendom</NORP> in controversy and war.
 The claims of the cardinals and inferior clergy, of the nobles and people, were vague and litigious: the freedom of choice was overruled by the tumults of a city that no longer owned or obeyed a superior.
 On the decease of a pope, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions proceeded in different churches to a double election: the number and weight of votes, the priority of time, the merit of the candidates, might balance each other: the most respectable of the clergy were divided; and the distant princes, who bowed before the spiritual throne, could not distinguish the spurious, from the legitimate, idol.
 The emperors were often the authors of the schism, from the political motive of opposing a friendly to a hostile pontiff; and each of the competitors was reduced to suffer the insults of his enemies, who were not awed by conscience, and to purchase the support of his adherents, who were instigated by avarice or ambition.
 Right of the cardinals established by Alexander III.
 A.
D.
 1179.
 A peaceful and perpetual succession was ascertained by Alexander the Third, (68) who finally abolished the tumultuary votes of the clergy and people, and defined the right of election in the sole college of cardinals.
 (69) The <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> orders of bishops, priests, and deacons, were assimilated to each other by this important privilege; the parochial clergy of <GPE>Rome</GPE> obtained the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rank in the hierarchy: they were indifferently chosen among the nations of Christendom; and the possession of the richest benefices, of the most important bishoprics, was not incompatible with their title and office.
 The senators of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church, the coadjutors and legates of the supreme pontiff, were robed in purple, the symbol of martyrdom or royalty; they claimed a proud equality with kings; and their dignity was enhanced by the smallness of their number, which, till the reign of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Tenth, seldom exceeded <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> or twenty-five persons.
 By this wise regulation, all doubt and scandal were removed, and the root of schism was so effectually destroyed, that in a period of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years a double choice has only once divided the unity of the sacred college.
 But as the concurrence of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thirds of the votes had been made necessary, the election was often delayed by the private interest and passions of the cardinals; and while they prolonged their independent reign, the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world was left destitute of a head.
 Institution of the conclave established by <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> X.
 A.
D.
 1274.
 A vacancy of almost <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years had preceded the elevation of George the Tenth, who resolved to prevent the future abuse; and his bull, after some opposition, has been consecrated in the code of the canon law.
 (70) Nine days are allowed for the obsequies of the deceased pope, and the arrival of the absent cardinals; on the tenth, they are imprisoned, each with <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> domestic, in a common apartment or conclave, without any separation of walls or curtains: a small window is reserved for the introduction of necessaries; but the door is locked on both sides and guarded by the magistrates of the city, to seclude them from all correspondence with the world.
 If the election be not consummated in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days, the luxury of their table is contracted to a single dish at dinner and supper; and after the eighth day, they are reduced to a scanty allowance of bread, water, and wine.
 During the vacancy of the holy see, the cardinals are prohibited from touching the revenues, or assuming, unless in some rare emergency, the government of the church: all agreements and promises among the electors are formally annulled; and their integrity is fortified by their solemn oath and the prayers of the Catholics.
 Some articles of inconvenient or superfluous rigour have been gradually relaxed, but the principle of confinement is vigorous and entire: they are still urged, by the personal motives of health and freedom, to accelerate the moment of their deliverance; and the improvement of ballot or secret votes has wrapped the struggles of the conclave (71) in the silky veil of charity and politeness.
 (72) By these institutions the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were excluded from the election of their prince and bishop; and in the fever of wild and precarious liberty, they seemed insensible of the loss of this inestimable privilege.
 A.
D.
 1328.
 The emperor <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> of <GPE>Bavaria</GPE> revived the example of the great Otho.
 After some negotiation with the magistrates, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people were assembled (73) in the square before St.
 Peter's: the pope of Avignon, <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Twenty-second, was deposed: the choice of his successor was ratified by their consent and applause.
 They freely voted for a new law, that their bishop should never be absent more than <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months in the year, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days' journey from the city; and that if he neglected to return on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> summons, the public servant should be degraded and dismissed.
 (74) But <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> forgot his own debility and the prejudices of the times: beyond the precincts of a <NORP>German</NORP> camp, his useless phantom was rejected; the <NORP>Romans</NORP> despised their own workmanship; the antipope implored the mercy of his lawful sovereign; (75) and the exclusive right of the cardinals was more firmly established by this unseasonable attack.
 Absence of the popes from Rome.
 Had the election been always held in the Vatican, the rights of the senate and people would not have been violated with impunity.
 But the <NORP>Romans</NORP> forgot, and were forgotten.
 in the absence of the successors of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, who did not keep as a divine precept their ordinary residence in the city and diocese.
 The care of that diocese was less important than the government of the universal church; nor could the popes delight in a city in which their authority was always opposed, and their person was often endangered.
 From the persecution of the emperors, and the wars of Italy, they escaped beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> into the hospitable bosom of France; from the tumults of <GPE>Rome</GPE> they prudently withdrew to live and die in the more tranquil stations of Anagni, Perugia, Viterbo, and the adjacent cities.
 When the flock was offended or impoverished by the absence of the shepherd, they were recalled by a stern admonition, that St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> had fixed his chair, not in an obscure village, but in the capital of the world; by a ferocious menace, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> would march in arms to destroy the place and people that should dare to afford them a retreat.
 They returned with timorous obedience; and were saluted with the account of a heavy debt, of all the losses which their desertion had occasioned, the hire of lodgings, the sale of provisions, and the various expenses of servants and strangers who attended the court.
 (76) After a short interval of peace, and perhaps of authority, they were again banished by new tumults, and again summoned by the imperious or respectful invitation of the senate.
 In these occasional retreats, the exiles and fugitives of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> were seldom long, or far, distant from the metropolis; but in the beginning of the fourteenth century, the apostolic throne was transported, as it might seem forever, from the <PERSON>Tyber</PERSON> to the Rhône <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> VIII.
 A.
D.
 1294-1303.
 and the cause of the transmigration may be deduced from the furious contest between <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> the Eighth and the king of France.
 (77) The spiritual arms of excommunication and interdict were repulsed by the union of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> estates, and the privileges of the <NORP>Gallican</NORP> church; but the pope was not prepared against the carnal weapons which <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> the Fair had courage to employ.
 As the pope resided at Anagni, without the suspicion of danger, his palace and person were assaulted by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horse, who had been secretly levied by William of Nogaret, a <NORP>French</NORP> minister, and Sciarra Colonna, of a noble but hostile family of Rome.
 The cardinals fled; the inhabitants of <GPE>Anagni</GPE> were seduced from their allegiance and gratitude; but the dauntless Boniface, unarmed and alone, seated himself in his chair, and awaited, like the conscript fathers of old, the swords of the Gauls.
 Nogaret, a foreign adversary, was content to execute the orders of his master: by the domestic enmity of Colonna, he was insulted with words and blows; and during a confinement of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days his life was threatened by the hardships which they inflicted on the obstinacy which they provoked.
 Their strange delay gave time and courage to the adherents of the church, who rescued him from sacrilegious violence; but his imperious soul was wounded in the vital part; and <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> expired at <GPE>Rome</GPE> in a frenzy of rage and revenge.
 His memory is stained with the glaring vices of avarice and pride; nor has the courage of a martyr promoted this ecclesiastical champion to the honours of a saint; a magnanimous sinner, (say the chronicles of the times,) who entered like a fox, reigned like a lion, and died like a dog.
 He was succeeded by <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> the Eleventh, the mildest of mankind.
 Yet he excommunicated the impious emissaries of Philip, and devoted the city and people of <GPE>Anagni</GPE> by a tremendous curse, whose effects are still visible to the eyes of superstition.
 (78) Translation of the holy see to Avignon, A.
D.
 1309.
 After his decease, the tedious and equal suspense of the conclave was fixed by the dexterity of the <NORP>French</NORP> faction.
 A specious offer was made and accepted, that, in the term of forty days, they would elect <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> candidates who should be named by their opponents.
 The archbishop of Bourdeaux, a furious enemy of his king and country, was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> on the list; but his ambition was known; and his conscience obeyed the calls of fortune and the commands of a benefactor, who had been informed by a swift messenger that the choice of a pope was now in his hands.
 The terms were regulated in a private interview; and with such speed and secrecy was the business transacted, that the unanimous conclave applauded the elevation of <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Fifth.
 (79) The cardinals of both parties were soon astonished by a summons to attend him beyond the Alps; from whence, as they soon discovered, they must never hope to return.
 He was engaged, by promise and affection, to prefer the residence of France; and, after dragging his court through <PERSON>Poitou</PERSON> and Gascony, and devouring, by his expense, the cities and convents on the road, he finally reposed at Avignon, (80) which flourished above seventy years (81) the seat of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff and the metropolis of Christendom.
 By land, by sea, by the Rhone, the position of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> was on all sides accessible; the southern provinces of <GPE>France</GPE> do not yield to <GPE>Italy</GPE> itself; new palaces arose for the accommodation of the pope and cardinals; and the arts of luxury were soon attracted by the treasures of the church.
 They were already possessed of the adjacent territory, the Venaissin county, (82) a populous and fertile spot; and the sovereignty of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> was afterwards purchased from the youth and distress of Jane, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> queen of <GPE>Naples</GPE> and countess of Provence, for the inadequate price of fourscore <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> florins.
 (83) Under the shadow of a <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy, amidst an obedient people, the popes enjoyed an honourable and tranquil state, to which they long had been strangers: but <GPE>Italy</GPE> deplored their absence; and Rome, in solitude and poverty, might repent of the ungovernable freedom which had driven from the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> the successor of St.
 Peter.
 Her repentance was tardy and fruitless: after the death of the old members, the sacred college was filled with <NORP>French</NORP> cardinals, (84) who beheld <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> with abhorrence and contempt, and perpetuated a series of national, and even provincial, popes, attached by the most indissoluble ties to their native country.
 Institution of the jubilee, or holy year, A.
D.
 1300.
 The progress of industry had produced and enriched the <NORP>Italian</NORP> republics: the aera of their liberty is the most flourishing period of population and agriculture, of manufactures and commerce; and their mechanic labours were gradually refined into the arts of elegance and genius.
 But the position of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was less favourable, the territory less fruitful: the character of the inhabitants was debased by indolence and elated by pride; and they fondly conceived that the tribute of subjects must forever nourish the metropolis of the church and empire.
 This prejudice was encouraged in some degree by the resort of pilgrims to the shrines of the apostles; and the last legacy of the popes, the institution of the HOLY YEAR, (85) was not less beneficial to the people than to the clergy.
 Since the loss of Palestine, the gift of plenary indulgences, which had been applied to the crusades, remained without an object; and the most valuable treasure of the church was sequestered above eight years from public circulation.
 A new channel was opened by the diligence of <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> the Eighth, who reconciled the vices of ambition and avarice; and the pope had sufficient learning to recollect and revive the secular games which were celebrated in <GPE>Rome</GPE> at the conclusion of every century.
 To sound without danger the depth of popular credulity, a sermon was seasonably pronounced, a report was artfully scattered, some aged witnesses were produced; and on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of January of the year thirteen hundred, the church of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> was crowded with the faithful, who demanded the customary indulgence of the holy time.
 The pontiff, who watched and irritated their devout impatience, was soon persuaded by ancient testimony of the justice of their claim; and he proclaimed a plenary absolution to all <NORP>Catholics</NORP> who, in the course of that year, and at every similar period, should respectfully visit the apostolic churches of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and St.
 Paul.
 The welcome sound was propagated through Christendom; and at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> from the nearest provinces of Italy, and at length from the remote kingdoms of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> and Britain, the highways were thronged with a swarm of pilgrims who sought to expiate their sins in a journey, however costly or laborious, which was exempt from the perils of military service.
 All exceptions of rank or sex, of age or infirmity, were forgotten in the common transport; and in the streets and churches many persons were trampled to death by the eagerness of devotion.
 The calculation of their numbers could not be easy nor accurate; and they have probably been magnified by a dexterous clergy, well apprised of the contagion of example: yet we are assured by a judicious historian, who assisted at the ceremony, that <GPE>Rome</GPE> was never replenished with less than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> strangers; and another spectator has fixed at <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> millions the total concourse of the year.
 A trifling oblation from each individual would accumulate a royal treasure; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> priests stood night and day, with rakes in their hands, to collect, without counting, the heaps of gold and silver that were poured on the altar of St.
 Paul.
 (86) It was fortunately a season of peace and plenty; and if forage was scarce, if inns and lodgings were extravagantly dear, an inexhaustible supply of bread and wine, of meat and fish, was provided by the policy of <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> and the venal hospitality of the Romans.
 From a city without trade or industry, all casual riches will speedily evaporate: but the avarice and envy of the next generation solicited <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Sixth (87) to anticipate the distant period of the century.
 The gracious pontiff complied with their wishes; afforded <GPE>Rome</GPE> this poor consolation for his loss; The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> jubilee, A.
D.
 1350.
 and justified the change by the name and practice of the Mosaic Jubilee.
 (88) His summons was obeyed; and the number, zeal, and liberality of the pilgrims did not yield to the primitive festival.
 But they encountered the triple scourge of war, pestilence, and famine: many wives and virgins were violated in the castles of Italy; and many strangers were pillaged or murdered by the savage Romans, no longer moderated by the presence of their bishops.
 (89) To the impatience of the popes we may ascribe the successive reduction to fifty, thirty-three, and twenty-five years; although the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> of these terms is commensurate with the life of Christ.
 The profusion of indulgences, the revolt of the Protestants, and the decline of superstition, have much diminished the value of the jubilee; yet even the <ORDINAL>nineteenth</ORDINAL> and last festival was a year of pleasure and profit to the Romans; and a philosophic smile will not disturb the triumph of the priest or the happiness of the people.
 (90) The nobles, or barons of Rome.
 In the beginning of the eleventh century, <GPE>Italy</GPE> was exposed to the feudal tyranny, alike oppressive to the sovereign and the people.
 The rights of human nature were vindicated by her numerous republics, who soon extended their liberty and dominion from the city to the adjacent country.
 The sword of the nobles was broken; their slaves were enfranchised; their castles were demolished; they assumed the habits of society and obedience; their ambition was confined to municipal honours, and in the proudest aristocracy of <GPE>Venice</GPE> on Genoa, each patrician was subject to the laws.
 (91) But the feeble and disorderly government of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was unequal to the task of curbing her rebellious sons, who scorned the authority of the magistrate within and without the walls.
 It was no longer a civil contention between the nobles and plebeians for the government of the state: the barons asserted in arms their personal independence; their palaces and castles were fortified against a siege; and their private quarrels were maintained by the numbers of their vassals and retainers.
 In origin and affection, they were aliens to their country: (92) and a genuine Roman, could such have been produced, might have renounced these haughty strangers, who disdained the appellation of citizens, and proudly styled themselves the princes, of Rome.
 (93) After a dark series of revolutions, all records of pedigree were lost; the distinction of surnames was abolished; the blood of the nations was mingled in a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> channels; and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Lombards, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Franks, the <NORP>Germans</NORP> and Normans, had obtained the fairest possessions by royal bounty, or the prerogative of valour.
 These examples might be readily presumed; but the elevation of a <NORP>Hebrew</NORP> race to the rank of senators and consuls is an event without a parallel in the long captivity of these miserable exiles.
 (94) In the time of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Ninth, a wealthy and learned <NORP>Jew</NORP> was converted to Christianity, and honoured at his baptism with the name of his godfather, the reigning Pope.
 Family of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the jew.
 The zeal and courage of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> the son of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> were signalized in the cause of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Seventh, who entrusted his faithful adherent with the government of Adrian's mole, the tower of Crescentius, or, as it is now called, the castle of St.
 Angelo.
 Both the father and the son were the parents of a numerous progeny: their riches, the fruits of usury, were shared with the noblest families of the city; and so extensive was their alliance, that the grandson of the proselyte was exalted by the weight of his kindred to the throne of St.
 Peter.
 A majority of the clergy and people supported his cause: he reigned several years in the Vatican; and it is only the eloquence of St.
 Bernard, and the final triumph of Innocence the Second, that has branded <PERSON>Anacletus</PERSON> with the epithet of antipope.
 After his defeat and death, the posterity of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> is no longer conspicuous; and none will be found of the modern nobles ambitious of descending from a <NORP>Jewish</NORP> stock.
 It is not my design to enumerate the <NORP>Roman</NORP> families which have failed at different periods, or those which are continued in different degrees of splendour to the present time.
 (95) The old consular line of the <NORP>Frangipani</NORP> discover their name in the generous act of breaking or dividing bread in a time of famine; and such benevolence is more truly glorious than to have enclosed, with their allies the Corsi, a spacious <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city in the chains of their fortifications; the Savelli, as it should seem a <NORP>Sabine</NORP> race, have maintained their original dignity; the obsolete surname of the <PERSON>Capizucchi</PERSON> is inscribed on the coins of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> senators; the <PERSON>Conti</PERSON> preserve the honour, without the estate, of the counts of Signia; and the <PERSON>Annibaldi</PERSON> must have been very ignorant, or very modest, if they had not descended from the <NORP>Carthaginian</NORP> hero.
 (96) The Colonna.
 But among, perhaps above, the peers and princes of the city, I distinguish the rival houses of <ORG>COLONNA</ORG> and URSINI, whose private story is an essential part of the annals of modern Rome.
 I.
 The name and arms of <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> (97) have been the theme of much doubtful etymology; nor have the orators and antiquarians overlooked either Trajan's pillar, or the columns of Hercules, or the pillar of Christ's flagellation, or the luminous column that guided the <NORP>Israelites</NORP> in the desert.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> historical appearance in the year eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> attests the power and antiquity, while it explains the simple meaning, of the name.
 By the usurpation of Cavae, the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> provoked the arms of <PERSON>Paschal</PERSON> the Second; but they lawfully held in the <LOC>Campagna</LOC> of <GPE>Rome</GPE> the hereditary fiefs of <GPE>Zagarola</GPE> and Colonna; and the latter of these towns was probably adorned with some lofty pillar, the relic of a villa or temple.
 (98) They likewise possessed <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety of the neighbouring city of Tusculum, a strong presumption of their descent from the counts of Tusculum, who in the tenth century were the tyrants of the apostolic see.
 According to their own and the public opinion, the primitive and remote source was derived from the banks of the Rhine; (99) and the sovereigns of <GPE>Germany</GPE> were not ashamed of a real or fabulous affinity with a noble race, which in the revolutions of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years has been often illustrated by merit and always by fortune.
 (100) About the end of the thirteenth century, the most powerful branch was composed of an uncle and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> bothers, all conspicuous in arms, or in the honours of the church.
 Of these, <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> was elected senator of Rome, introduced to the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> in a triumphal car, and hailed in some vain acclamations with the title of Caesar; while <PERSON>John</PERSON> and <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> were declared marquis of <PERSON>Ancona</PERSON> and count of Romagna, by <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the Fourth, a patron so partial to their family, that he has been delineated in satirical portraits, imprisoned as it were in a hollow pillar.
 (101) After his decease their haughty behaviour provoked the displeasure of the most implacable of mankind.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> cardinals, the uncle and the nephew, denied the election of <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> the Eighth; and the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> were oppressed for a moment by his temporal and spiritual arms.
 (102) He proclaimed a crusade against his personal enemies; their estates were confiscated; their fortresses on either side of the <PERSON>Tyber</PERSON> were besieged by the troops of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> and those of the rival nobles; and after the ruin of <GPE>Palestrina</GPE> or Praeneste, their principal seat, the ground was marked with a ploughshare, the emblem of perpetual desolation.
 Degraded, banished, proscribed, the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> brothers, in disguise and danger, wandered over <LOC>Europe</LOC> without renouncing the hope of deliverance and revenge.
 In this double hope, the <NORP>French</NORP> court was their surest asylum; they prompted and directed the enterprise of Philip; and I should praise their magnanimity, had they respected the misfortune and courage of the captive tyrant.
 His civil acts were annulled by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, who restored the honours and possessions of the Colonna; and some estimate may be formed of their wealth by their losses, of their losses by the damages of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> gold florins which were granted them against the accomplices and heirs of the deceased pope.
 All the spiritual censures and disqualifications were abolished (103) by his prudent successors; and the fortune of the house was more firmly established by this transient hurricane.
 The boldness of Sciarra <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> was signalized in the captivity of Boniface, and long afterwards in the coronation of <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> of Bavaria; and by the gratitude of the emperor, the pillar in their arms was encircled with a royal crown.
 But the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the family in fame and merit was the elder Stephen, whom <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> loved and esteemed as a hero superior to his own times, and not unworthy of ancient Rome.
 Persecution and exile displayed to the nations his abilities in peace and war; in his distress he was an object, not of pity, but of reverence; the aspect of danger provoked him to avow his name and country; and when he was asked, "Where is now your fortress?" he laid his hand on his heart, and answered, "Here.
" He supported with the same virtue the return of prosperity; and, till the ruin of his declining age, the ancestors, the character, and the children of <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> Colonna, exalted his dignity in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic, and at the court of Avignon.
 and Ursini.
 II.
 The <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> migrated from Spoleto; (104) the sons of Ursus, as they are styled in the twelfth century, from some eminent person, who is only known as the father of their race.
 But they were soon distinguished among the nobles of Rome, by the number and bravery of their kinsmen, the strength of their towers, the honours of the senate and sacred college, and the elevation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> popes, <ORG>Celestin</ORG> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> and <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the Third, of their name and lineage.
 (105) Their riches may be accused as an early abuse of nepotism: the estates of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> were alienated in their favour by the liberal Celestin; (106) and <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> was ambitious for their sake to solicit the alliance of monarchs; to found new kingdoms in <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> and Tuscany; and to invest them with the perpetual office of senators of Rome.
 Their hereditary feuds.
 All that has been observed of the greatness of the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> will likewise redeemed to the glory of the Ursini, their constant and equal antagonists in the long hereditary feud, which distracted above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years the ecclesiastical state.
 The jealously of pre-eminence and power was the true ground of their quarrel; but as a specious badge of distinction, the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> embraced the name of <PERSON>Ghibelines</PERSON> and the party of the empire; the <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> espoused the title of <PERSON>Guelphs</PERSON> and the cause of the church.
 The eagle and the keys were displayed in their adverse banners; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions of <GPE>Italy</GPE> most furiously raged when the origin and nature of the dispute were long since forgotten.
 (107) After the retreat of the popes to <GPE>Avignon</GPE> they disputed in arms the vacant republic; and the mischiefs of discord were perpetuated by the wretched compromise of electing each year <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rival senators.
 By their private hostilities the city and country were desolated, and the fluctuating balance inclined with their alternate success.
 But none of either family had fallen by the sword, till the most renowned champion of the <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> was surprised and slain by the younger <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> Colonna.
 (108) His triumph is stained with the reproach of violating the truce; their defeat was basely avenged by the assassination, before the church door, of an innocent boy and his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> servants.
 Yet the victorious Colonna, with an annual colleague, was declared senator of <GPE>Rome</GPE> during the term of five years.
 And the muse of <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> inspired a wish, a hope, a prediction, that the generous youth, the son of his venerable hero, would restore <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> to their pristine glory; that his justice would extirpate the wolves and lions, the serpents and bears, who labored to subvert the eternal basis of the marble COLUMN.
