Final Division of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> Empire between the Sons of Theodosius.

D.
 395, January 17.
 THE genius of <GPE>Rome</GPE> expired with Theodosius, the last of the successors of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> who appeared in the field at the head of their armies, and whose authority was universally acknowledged throughout the whole extent of the empire.
 The memory of his virtues still continued, however, to protect the feeble and inexperienced youth of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons.
 After the death of their father, <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were saluted, by the unanimous consent of mankind, as the lawful emperors of the <LOC>East</LOC> and of the West; and the oath of fidelity was eagerly taken by every order of the state, the senates of old and new Rome, the clergy, the magistrates, the soldiers, and the people.
 Arcadius, who then was about eighteen years of age, was born in <GPE>Spain</GPE> in the humble habitation of a private family.
 But he received a princely education in the palace of Constantinople; and his inglorious life was spent in that peaceful and splendid seat of royalty, from whence he appeared to reign over the provinces of Thrace, <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, Syria, and Egypt, from the Lower <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the confines of <PERSON>Persia</PERSON> and Aetheopia.
 His younger brother, Honorius, assumed, in the eleventh year of his age, the nominal government of Italy, Africa, Gaul, Spain, and Britain; and the troops which guarded the frontiers of his kingdom were opposed, on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> side, to the Caledonians, and on the other to the Moors.
 The great and martial praefecture of <PERSON>Illyricum</PERSON> was divided between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes: the defence and possession of the provinces of Noricum, Pannonia, and Dalmatia, still belonged to the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire; but the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> large dioceses of <GPE>Dacia</GPE> and Macedonia, which <ORG>Gratian</ORG> had intrusted to the valour of Theodosius, were for ever united to the empire of the East.
 The boundary in <LOC>Europe</LOC> was not very different from the line which now separates the <NORP>Germans</NORP> and the Turks; and the respective advantages of territory, riches, populousness, and military strength, were fairly balanced and compensated in this final and permanent division of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire The hereditary sceptre of the sons of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> appeared to be the gift of nature and of their father; the generals and ministers had been accustomed to adore the majesty of the royal infants and the army and people were not admonished of their rights, and of their power, by the dangerous example of a recent election.
 The gradual discovery of the weakness of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> and Honorius, and the repeated calamities of their reign, were not sufficient to obliterate the deep and early impressions of loyalty.
 The subjects of Rome, who still reverenced the persons, or rather the names, of their sovereigns, beheld with equal abhorrence the rebels who opposed, and the ministers who abused, the authority of the throne.
 Character and administration of Rufinus, A.
D.
 386-395 <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> had tarnished the glory of his reign by the elevation of Rufinus, an odious favourite, who in an age of civil and religious faction has deserved, from every party, the imputation of every crime.
 The strong impulse of ambition and avarice (1) had urged <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> to abandon his native country, an obscure corner of Gaul,(2) to advance his fortune in the capital of the East: the talent of bold and ready elocution(3) qualified him to succeed in the lucrative profession of the law; and his success in that profession was a regular step to the most honourable and important employments of the state.
 He was raised, by just degrees, to the station of master of the offices.
 In the exercise of his various functions, so essentially connected with the whole system of civil government, he acquired the confidence of a monarch who soon discovered his diligence and capacity in business, and who long remained ignorant of the pride, the malice, and the covetousness of his disposition.
 These vices were concealed beneath the mask of profound dissimulation;(4) his passions were subservient only to the passions of his master; yet, in the horrid massacre of Thessalonica, the cruel <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> inflamed the fury, without imitating the repentance, of Theodosius.
 The minister, who viewed with proud indifference the rest of mankind, never forgave the appearance of an injury; and his personal enemies had forfeited, in his opinion, the merit of all public services.
 Promotus, the master-general of the infantry, had saved the empire from the invasion of the Ostrogoths; but he indignantly supported the pre-eminence of a rival whose character and profession he despised; and, in the midst of a public council, the impatient soldier was provoked to chastise with a blow the indecent pride of the favourite.
 This act of violence was represented to the emperor as an insult which it was incumbent on his dignity to resent.
 The disgrace and exile of <PERSON>Promotus</PERSON> were signified by a peremptory order to repair without delay to a military station on the banks of the Danube; and the death of that general (though he was slain in a skirmish with the barbarians) was imputed to the perfidious arts of Rufinus.
(5) The sacrifice of an hero gratified his revenge; the honours of the consulship elated his vanity; but his power was still imperfect and precarious as long as the important posts of praefect of the East, and of praefect of Constantinople, were filled by <NORP>Tatian</NORP> (6) and his son Proculus, whose united authority balanced for some time the ambition and favour of the master of the offices.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> praefects were accused of rapine and corruption in administration of the laws and finances.
 For the trial of these illustrious offenders the emperor constituted a special commission: several judges were named to share the guilt and reproach of injustice; but the right of pronouncing sentence was reserved to the president alone, and that president was <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> himself.
 The father, stripped of the praefecture of the East, was thrown into a dungeon; but the son, conscious that few ministers can be found innocent where an enemy is their judge, had secretly escaped; and <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> must have been satisfied with the least obnoxious victim, if despotism had not condescended to employ the basest and most ungenerous artifice.
 The prosecution was conducted with an appearance of equity and moderation which flattered <NORP>Tatian</NORP> with the hope of a favourable event: his confidence was fortified by the solemn assurances and perfidious oaths of the president, who presumed to interpose the sacred name of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> himself; and the unhappy father was at last persuaded to recall, by a private letter, the fugitive Proculus.
 He was instantly seized, examined, condemned, and beheaded in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the suburbs of Constantinople, with a precipitation which disappointed the clemency of the emperor.
 Without respecting the misfortunes of a consular senator, the cruel judges of <NORP>Tatian</NORP> compelled him to behold the execution of his son: the fatal cord was fastened round his own neck; but in the moment when he expected, and perhaps desired, the relief of a speedy death, he was permitted to consume the miserable remnant of his old age in poverty and exile.
 (7) The punishment of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> praefects might perhaps be excused by the exceptionable parts of their own conduct; the enmity of <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> might be palliated by the jealous and unsociable nature of ambition.
 But he indulged a spirit of revenge, equally repugnant to prudence and to justice, when he degraded their native country of <GPE>Lycia</GPE> from the rank of <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces, stigmatised a guiltless people with a mark of ignominy, and declared that the countrymen of <NORP>Tatian</NORP> and <PERSON>Proculus</PERSON> should for ever remain incapable of holding any employment of honour or advantage under the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> government.
(8) The new praefect of the <LOC>East</LOC> (for <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> instantly succeeded to the vacant honours of his adversary) was not diverted, however, by the most criminal pursuits from the performance of the religious duties which in that age were considered as the most essential to salvation.
 In the suburb of Chalcedon, surnamed the Oak, he had built a magnificent villa, to which he devoutly added a stately church consecrated to the apostles St.
 Peter and St.
 Paul, and continually sanctified by the prayers and penance of a regular society of monks.
 A numerous and almost general synod of the bishops of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire was summoned to celebrate at the same time the dedication of the church and the baptism of the founder.
 This double ceremony was performed with extraordinary pomp; and when <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> was purified in the holy font from all the sins that he had hitherto committed, a venerable hermit of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> rashly proposed himself as the sponsor of a proud and ambitious statesman.
(9) He oppresses the East.
 A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>395</CARDINAL> The character of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> imposed on his minister the task of hypocrisy, which disguised, and sometimes restrained, the abuse of power; and <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> was apprehensive of disturbing the indolent slumber of a prince still capable of exerting the abilities and the virtue which had raised him to the throne.
(10) But the absence, and soon afterwards the death, of the emperor confirmed the absolute authority of <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> over the person and dominions of Arcadius, a feeble youth, whom the imperious praefect considered as his pupil, rather than his sovereign.
 Regardless of the public opinion, he indulged his passions without remorse and without resistance; and his malignant and rapacious spirit rejected every passion that might have contributed to his own glory or the happiness of the people.
 His avarice,(11) which seems to have prevailed in his corrupt mind over every other sentiment, attracted the wealth of the <LOC>East</LOC> by the various arts of partial and general extortion—oppressive taxes, scandalous bribery, immoderate fines, unjust confiscations, forced or fictitious testaments, by which the tyrant despoiled of their lawful inheritance the children of strangers or enemies; and the public sale of justice, as well as of favour, which he instituted in the palace of Constantinople.
 The ambitious candidate eagerly solicited, at the expense of the fairest part of his patrimony, the honours and emoluments of some provincial government; the lives and fortunes of the unhappy people were abandoned to the most liberal purchaser, and the public discontent was sometimes appeased by the sacrifice of an unpopular criminal, whose punishment was profitable only to the praefect of the East, his accomplice and his judge.
 If avarice were not the blindest of the human passions, the motives of <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> might excite our curiosity, and we might be tempted to inquire with what view he violated every principle of humanity and justice to accumulate those immense treasures which he could not spend without folly nor possess without danger.
 Perhaps he vainly imagined that he laboured for the interest of an only daughter, on whom he intended to bestow his royal pupil and the august rank of empress of the East.
 Perhaps he deceived himself by the opinion that his avarice was the instrument of his ambition.
 He aspired to place his fortune on a secure and independent basis, which should no longer depend on the caprice of the young emperor; yet he neglected to conciliate the hearts of the soldiers and people by the liberal distribution of those riches which he had acquired with so much toil and with so much guilt.
 The extreme parsimony of <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> left him only the reproach and envy of ill-gotten wealth; his dependents served him without attachment; the universal hatred of mankind was repressed only by the influence of servile fear.
 The fate of <PERSON>Lucian</PERSON> proclaimed to the <LOC>East</LOC> that the praefect, whose industry was much abated in the despatch of ordinary business, was active and indefatigable in the pursuit of revenge.
 Lucian, the son of the praefect Florentius, the oppressor of <GPE>Gaul</GPE> and the enemy of Julian, had employed a considerable part of his inheritance, the fruit of rapine and corruption, to purchase the friendship of <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> and the high office of count of the East.
 But the new magistrate imprudently departed from the maxims of the court and of the times, disgraced his benefactor by the contrast of a virtuous and temperate administration, and presumed to refuse an act of injustice which might have tended to the profit of the emperor's uncle.
 <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> was easily persuaded to resent the supposed insult; and the praefect of the <LOC>East</LOC> resolved to execute in person the cruel vengeance which he meditated against this ungrateful delegate of his power.
 He performed with incessant speed the journey of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> or eight hundred miles from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to Antioch, entered the capital of <GPE>Syria</GPE> at the dead of night, and spread universal consternation among a people ignorant of his design, but not ignorant of his character.
 The count of the <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> provinces of the <LOC>East</LOC> was dragged, like the vilest malefactor, before the arbitrary tribunal of Rufinus.
 Notwithstanding the clearest evidence of his integrity, which was not impeached even by the voice of an accuser, <PERSON>Lucian</PERSON> was condemned, almost without a trial, to suffer a cruel and ignominious punishment.
 The ministers of the tyrant, by the order and in the presence of their master, beat him on the neck with leather thongs armed at the extremities with lead; and when he fainted under the violence of the pain, he was removed in a close litter to conceal his dying agonies from the eyes of the indignant city.
 No sooner had <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> perpetrated this inhuman act, the sole object of his expedition, than he returned, amidst the deep and silent curses of a trembling people, from <GPE>Antioch</GPE> to Constantinople; and his diligence was accelerated by the hope of accomplishing, without delay, the nuptials of his daughter with the emperor of the East.
(12) He is disappointed by the marriage of Arcadius, A.
D.
 395, April <CARDINAL>27</CARDINAL> But <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> soon experienced that a prudent minister should constantly secure his royal captive by the strong, though invisible, chain of habit; and that the merit, and much more easily the favour of the absent, are obliterated in a short time from the mind of a weak and capricious sovereign.
 While the praefect satiated his revenge at Antioch, a secret conspiracy of the favourite eunuchs, directed by the great chamberlain Eutropius, undermined his power in the palace of Constantinople.
 They discovered that <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> was not inclined to love the daughter of Rufinus, who had been chosen without his consent for his bride, and they contrived to substitute in her place the fair Eudoxia, the daughter of Bauto,(13) a general of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> in the service of Rome, and who was educated, since the death of her father, in the family of the sons of Promotus.
 The young emperor, whose chastity had been strictly guarded by the pious care of his tutor Arsenius,(14) eagerly listened to the artful and flattering descriptions of the charms of Eudoxia; he gazed with impatient ardour on her picture, and he understood the necessity of concealing his amorous designs from the knowledge of a minister who was so deeply interested to oppose the consummation of his happiness.
 Soon after the return of Rufinus, the approaching ceremony of the royal nuptials was announced to the people of Constantinople, who prepared to celebrate with false and hollow acclamations the fortune of his daughter.
 A splendid train of eunuchs and officers issued, in hymeneal pomp, from the gates of the palace, bearing aloft the diadem, the robes, and the inestimable ornaments of the future empress.
 The solemn procession passed through the streets of the city, which were adorned with garlands and filled with spectators; but when it reached the house of the sons of Promotus, the principal eunuch respectfully entered the mansion, invested the fair <PERSON>Eudoxia</PERSON> with the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> robes, and conducted her in triumph to the palace and bed of Arcadius.
(15) The secrecy and success with which this conspiracy against <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> had been conducted imprinted a mark of indelible ridicule on the character of a minister who had suffered himself to be deceived, in a post where the arts of deceit and dissimulation constitute the most distinguished merit.
 He considered, with a mixture of indignation and fear, the victory of an aspiring eunuch who had secretly captivated the favour of his sovereign; and the disgrace of his daughter, whose interest was inseparably connected with his own, wounded the tenderness, or at least the pride, of Rufinus.
 At the moment when he flattered himself that he should become the father of a line of kings, a foreign maid, who had been educated in the house of his implacable enemies, was introduced into the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> bed; and <PERSON>Eudoxia</PERSON> soon displayed a superiority of sense and spirit to improve the ascendant which her beauty must acquire over the mind of a fond and youthful husband.
 The emperor would soon be instructed to hate, to fear, and to destroy the powerful subject whom he had injured; and the consciousness of guilt deprived <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> of every hope, either of safety or comfort, in the retirement of a private life.
 But he still possessed the most effectual means of defending his dignity, and perhaps of oppressing his enemies.
 The praefect still exercised an uncontrolled authority over the civil and military government of the East; and his treasures, if he could resolve to use them, might be employed to procure proper instruments for the execution of the blackest designs that pride, ambition, and revenge could suggest to a desperate statesman.
 The character of <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> seemed to justify the accusations that he conspired against the person of his sovereign to seat himself on the vacant throne; and that he had secretly invited the <NORP>Huns</NORP> and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> to invade the provinces of the empire and to increase the public confusion.
 The subtle praefect, whose life had been spent in the intrigues of the palace, opposed with equal arms the artful measures of the eunuch Eutropius; but the timid soul of <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> was astonished by the hostile approach of a more formidable rival, of the great Stilicho, the general, or rather the master, of the empire of the West.
(16) Character of Stilicho, the minister, and general, of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 The celestial gift, which <PERSON>Achilles</PERSON> obtained, and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> envied, of a poet worthy to celebrate the actions of heroes, has been enjoyed by Stilicho, in a much higher degree than might have been expected from the declining state of genius and of art.
 The muse of Claudian,(17) devoted to his service, was always prepared to stigmatise his adversaries, <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> or Eutropius, with eternal infamy; or to paint, in the most splendid colours, the victories and virtues of a powerful benefactor.
 In the review of a period indifferently supplied with authentic materials, we cannot refuse to illustrate the annals of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> from the invectives, or the panegyrics, of a contemporary writer; but as <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> appears to have indulged the most ample privilege of a poet and a courtier, some criticism will be requisite to translate the language of fiction or exaggeration into the truth and simplicity of historic prose.
 His silence concerning the family of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> may be admitted as a proof that his patron was neither able nor desirous to boast of a long series of illustrious progenitors, and the slight mention of his father, an officer of barbarian cavalry in the service of Valens, seems to countenance the assertion that the general who so long commanded the armies of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was descended from the savage and perfidious race of the Vandals.
 (18) If <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> had not possessed the external advantages of strength and stature, the most flattering bard, in the presence of so many thousand spectators, would have hesitated to affirm that he surpassed the measure of the demigods of antiquity; and that, whenever he moved, with lofty steps, through the streets of the capital, the astonished crowd made room for the stranger, who displayed, in a private condition, the awful majesty of a hero.
 From his earliest youth he embraced the profession of arms; his prudence and valour were soon distinguished in the field; the horsemen and archers of the <LOC>East</LOC> admired his superior dexterity; and in each degree of his military promotions, the public judgment always prevented and approved the choice of the sovereign.
 He was named by <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> to ratify a solemn treaty with the monarch of Persia:; he supported, during that important embassy, the dignity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name; and after his return to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> his merit was rewarded by an intimate and honourable alliance with the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> family.
 <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> had been prompted, by a pious motive of fraternal affection, to adopt, for his own, the daughter of his brother Honorius; the beauty and accomplishments of Serena(19) were universally admired by the obsequious court; and <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> obtained the preference over a crowd of rivals who ambitiously disputed the hand of the princess, and the favour of her adoptive father.
(20) The assurance that the husband of <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> would be faithful to the throne which he was permitted to approach engaged the emperor to exalt the fortunes, and to employ the abilities, of the sagacious and intrepid Stilicho.
 His military command, A.
D.
 385-408 He rose through the successive steps of master of the horse, and count of the domestics, to the supreme rank of master-general of all the cavalry and infantry of the Roman, or at least of the Western, empire;(21) and his enemies confessed that he invariably disdained to barter for gold the rewards of merit, or to defraud the soldiers of the pay and gratifications which they deserved or claimed from the liberality of the state.
(22) The valour and conduct which he afterwards displayed in the defence of <GPE>Italy</GPE> against the arms of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> and <PERSON>Radagaisus</PERSON> may justify the fame of his early achievements; and in an age less attentive to the laws of honour or of pride, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals might yield the pre-eminence of rank to the ascendant of superior genius.
 (23) He lamented and revenged the murder of Promotus, his rival and his friend; and the massacre of many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the flying <GPE>Bastarnae</GPE> is represented by the poet as a bloody sacrifice which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> <PERSON>Achilles</PERSON> offered to the names of another Patroclus.
 The virtues and victories of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> deserved the hatred of Rufinus: and the arts of calumny might have been successful, if the tender and vigilant <PERSON>Serena</PERSON> had not protected her husband against his domestic foes, whilst he vanquished in the field the enemies of the empire.
 (24) <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> continued to support an unworthy minister, to whose diligence he delegated the government of the palace and of the East; but when he marched against the tyrant Eugenius, he associated his faithful general to the labours and glories of the civil war; and in the last moments of his life the dying monarch recommended to <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> the care of his son and of the republic.
(25) The ambition and the abilities of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> were not unequal to the important trust; and he claimed the guardianship of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires during the minority of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> and Honorius.
(26) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> measure of his administration, or rather of his reign, displayed to the nations the vigour and activity of a spirit worthy to command.
 He passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> in the depth of winter; descended the stream of the Rhine, from the fortress of <GPE>Basel</GPE> to the marshes of Batavia; reviewed the state of the garrisons; repressed the enterprises of the Germans; and, after establishing along the banks a firm and honourable peace, returned with incredible speed to the palace of Milan.
 (27) The person and court of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were subject to the master-general of the West; and the armies and provinces of <LOC>Europe</LOC> obeyed, without hesitation, a regular authority, which was exercised in the name of their young sovereign.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> rivals only remained to dispute the claims, and to provoke the vengeance, of Stilicho.
 Within the limits of Africa, Gildo, the Moor, maintained a proud and dangerous independence; and the minister of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> asserted his equal reign over the emperor and the empire of the East.
 The fall and death of Rufinus,.
 A.
D.
 395, November 27th.
 The impartiality which <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> affected, as the common guardian of the royal brothers, engaged him to regulate the equal division of the arms, the jewels, and the magnificent wardrobe and furniture of the deceased emperor.
(28) But the most important object of the inheritance consisted of the numerous legions, cohorts, and squadrons, of <NORP>Romans</NORP> or barbarians, whom the event of the civil war had united under the standard of Theodosius.
 The various multitudes of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, exasperated by recent animosities, were overawed by the authority of a single man; and the rigid discipline of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> protected the lands of the citizen from the rapine of the licentious soldier.
(29) Anxious, however, and impatient to relieve <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the presence of this formidable host, which could be useful only on the frontiers of the empire, he listened to the just requisition of the minister of Arcadius, declared his intention of reconducting in person the troops of the East, and dexterously employed the rumour of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> tumult to conceal his private designs of ambition and revenge.
 (30) The guilty soul of <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> was alarmed by the approach of a warrior and a rival whose enmity he deserved; he computed, with increasing terror, the narrow space of his life and greatness; and, as the last hope of safety, he interposed the authority of the emperor Arcadius.
 <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> who appears to have directed his march along the seacoast of the Hadriatic, was not far distant from the city of <GPE>Thessalonica</GPE> when he received a peremptory message to recall the troops of the East, and to declare that his nearer approach would be considered, by the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court, as an act of hostility.
 The prompt and unexpected obedience of the general of the <LOC>West</LOC> convinced the vulgar of his loyalty and moderation; and, as he had already engaged the affection of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> troops, he recommended to their zeal the execution of his bloody design, which might be accomplished in his absence, with less danger perhaps, and with less reproach.
 <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> left the command of the troops of the <LOC>East</LOC> to Gainas, the Goth, on whose fidelity he firmly relied, with an assurance at least that the hardy barbarian would never be diverted from his purpose by any consideration of fear or remorse.
 The soldiers were easily persuaded to punish the enemy of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> and of Rome; and such was the general hatred which <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> had excited, that the fatal secret, communicated to thousands, was faithfully preserved during the long march from <GPE>Thessalonica</GPE> to the gates of Constantinople.
 As soon as they had resolved his death, they condescended to flatter his pride; the ambitious praefect was seduced to believe that those powerful auxiliaries might be tempted to place the diadem on his head; and the treasures which he distributed with a tardy and reluctant hand were accepted by the indignant multitude as an insult rather than as a gift.
 At the distance of a mile from the capital, in the field of Mars, before the palace of Hebdomon, the troops halted; and the emperor, as well as his minister, advanced, according to ancient custom, respectfully to salute the power which supported their throne.
 As <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> passed along the ranks, and disguised, with studied courtesy, his innate haughtiness, the wings insensibly wheeled from the right and left, and enclosed the devoted victim within the circle of their arms.
 Before he could reflect on the danger of his situation, <PERSON>Gainas</PERSON> gave the signal of death; a daring and forward soldier plunged his sword into the breast of the guilty praefect, and <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> fell, groaned, and expired, at the feet of the affrighted emperor.
 If the agonies of a moment could expiate the crimes of a whole life, or if the outrages inflicted on a breathless corpse could be the object of pity, our humanity might perhaps be affected by the horrid circumstances which accompanied the murder of Rufinus.
 His mangled body was abandoned to the brutal fury of the populace of either sex, who hastened in crowds, from every <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, to trample on the remains of the haughty minister, at whose frown they had so lately trembled.
 His right hand was cut off, and carried through the streets of Constantinople, in cruel mockery, to extort contributions for the avaricious tyrant, whose head was publicly exposed, borne aloft on the point of a long lance.
 (31) According to the savage maxims of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> republics, his innocent family would have shared the punishment of his crimes.
 The wife and daughter of <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> were indebted for their safety to the influence of religion.
 Her sanctuary protected them from the raging madness of the people; and they were permitted to spend the remainder of their lives in the exercises of <NORP>Christian</NORP> devotion in the peaceful retirement of Jerusalem.
(32) Discord of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, A.
D.
 396 etc The servile poet of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> applauds with ferocious joy this horrid deed, which, in the execution, perhaps of justice, violated every law of nature and society, profaned the majesty of the prince, and renewed the dangerous examples of military licence.
 The contemplation of the universal order and harmony had satisfied <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> of the existence of the Deity; but the prosperous impunity of vice appeared to contradict his moral attributes; and the fate of <ORG>Rufinus</ORG> was the only event which could dispel the religious doubts of the poet.
 (33) Such an act might vindicate the honour of Providence; but it did not much contribute to the happiness of the people.
 In less than three months they were informed of the maxims of the new administration, by a singular edict, which established the exclusive right of the treasury over the spoils of Rufinus; they silenced, under heavy penalties, the presumptuous claims of the subjects of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire who had been injured by his rapacious tyranny.
(34) Even <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> did not derive from the murder of his rival the fruit which he had proposed; and though he gratified his revenge, his ambition was disappointed.
 Under the name of a favourite, the weakness of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> required a master, but he naturally preferred the obsequious arts of the eunuch Eutropius, who had obtained his domestic confidence; and the emperor contemplated with terror and aversion the stern genius of a foreign warrior.
 Till they were divided by the jealousy of power, the sword of Gainas, and the charms of Eudoxia, supported the favour of the great chamberlain of the palace: the perfidious Goth, who was appointed master-general of the East, betrayed, without scruple, the interest of his benefactor; and the same troops who had so lately massacred the enemy of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> were engaged to support, against him, the independence of the throne of Constantinople.
 The favourites of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> fomented a secret and irreconcilable war against a formidable hero, who aspired to govern and to defend the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons of Theodosius.
 They incessantly laboured, by dark and treacherous machinations, to deprive him of the esteem of the prince, the respect of the people, and the friendship of the barbarians.
 The life of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> was repeatedly attempted by the dagger of hired assassins and a decree was obtained from the senate of Constantinople, to declare him an enemy of the republic, and to confiscate his ample possessions in the provinces of the East.
 At a time when the only hope of delaying the ruin of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name depended on the firm union and reciprocal aid of all the nations to whom it had been gradually communicated, the subjects of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were instructed, by their respective masters, to view each other in a foreign and even hostile light to rejoice in their mutual calamities; and to embrace, as their faithful allies, the barbarians whom they excited to invade the territories of their countrymen.
 (35) The natives of <GPE>Italy</GPE> affected to despise the servile and effeminate <NORP>Greeks</NORP> of Byzantium, who presumed to imitate the dress, and to usurp the dignity, of <NORP>Roman</NORP> senators;(36) and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> had not yet forgot the sentiments of hatred and contempt which their polished ancestors had so long entertained for the rude inhabitants of the West.
 The distinction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> governments, which soon produced the separation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, will justify my design of suspending the series of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> history, to prosecute, without interruption, the disgraceful but memorable reign of Honorius.

 The prudent Stilicho, instead of persisting to force the inclinations of a prince and people who rejected his government, wisely abandoned <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> to his unworthy favourites; and his reluctance to involve the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires in a civil war displayed the moderation of a minister who had so often signalised his military spirit and abilities.
 But if <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> had any longer endured the revolt of Africa, he would have betrayed the security of the capital, and the majesty of the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor, to the capricious insolence of a <NORP>Moorish</NORP> rebel.
 Gildo, (37) the brother of the tyrant Firmus, had preserved and obtained, as the reward of his apparent fidelity, the immense patrimony which was forfeited by treason; long and meritorious service in the armies of <GPE>Rome</GPE> raised him to the dignity of a military count; the narrow policy of the court of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> had adopted the mischievous expedient of supporting a legal government by the interest of a powerful family and the brother of <ORG>Firmus</ORG> was invested with the command of Africa.
 His ambition soon usurped the administration of justice and of the finances, without account and without control; and he maintained, during a reign of twelve years, the possession of an office from which it was impossible to remove him without the danger of a civil war.
 During those twelve years the provinces of <LOC>Africa</LOC> groaned under the dominion of a tyrant who seemed to unite the unfeeling temper of a stranger with the partial resentments of domestic faction.
 The forms of law were often superseded by the use of poison; and if the trembling guests who were invited to the table of <PERSON>Gildo</PERSON> presumed to express their fears, the insolent suspicion served only to excite his fury, and he loudly summoned the ministers of death.
 <PERSON>Gildo</PERSON> alternately indulged the passions of avarice and lust;(38) and if his days were terrible to the rich, his nights were not less dreadful to husbands and parents.
 The fairest of their wives and daughters were prostituted to the embraces of the tyrant; and afterwards abandoned to a ferocious troop of barbarians and assassins, the black or swarthy natives of the desert, whom <PERSON>Gildo</PERSON> considered as the only guardians of his throne.
 In the civil war between <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> and Eugenius, the count, or rather the sovereign of Africa, maintained a haughty and suspicious neutrality; refused to assist either of the contending parties with troops or vessels, expected the declaration of fortune, and reserved for the conqueror the vain professions of his allegiance.
 Such professions would not have satisfied the master of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world: but the death of Theodosius, and the weakness and discord of his sons, confirmed the power of the Moor, who condescended, as a proof of his moderation, to abstain from the use of the diadem and to supply <GPE>Rome</GPE> with the customary tribute, or rather subsidy, of corn.
 In every division of the empire, the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> provinces of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were invariably assigned to the West; and <PERSON>Gildo</PERSON> had consented to govern that extensive country in the name of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> but his knowledge of the character and designs of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> soon engaged him to address his homage to a more distant and feeble sovereign.
 The ministers of <PERSON>Arcadius</PERSON> embraced the cause of a perfidious rebel; and the delusive hope of adding the numerous cities of <LOC>Africa</LOC> to the empire of the <LOC>East</LOC> tempted them to assert a claim which they were incapable of supporting either by reason or by arms(39) He is condemned by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate, A.
D.
 397 When <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> had given a firm and decisive answer to the pretensions of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court, he solemnly accused the tyrant of <LOC>Africa</LOC> before the tribunal which had formerly judged the kings and nations of the earth; and the image of the republic was revived, after a long interval, under the reign of Honorius.
 The emperor transmitted an accurate and ample detail of the complaints of the provincials, and the crimes of Gildo, to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate; and the members of that venerable assembly were required to pronounce the condemnation of the rebel.
 Their unanimous suffrage declared him the enemy of the republic; and the decree of the senate added a sacred and legitimate sanction to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms.
(40) A people who still remembered that their ancestors had been the masters of the world would have applauded, with conscious pride, the representation of ancient freedom, if they had not long since been accustomed to prefer the solid assurance of bread to the unsubstantial visions of liberty and greatness.
 The subsistence of <GPE>Rome</GPE> depended on the harvests of Africa, and it was evident that a declaration of war would be the signal of famine.
 The praefect Symmachus, who presided in the deliberations of the senate, admonished the minister of his just apprehension that, as soon as the revengeful <PERSON>Moor</PERSON> should prohibit the exportation of corn, the tranquillity, and perhaps the safety, of the capital would be threatened by the hungry rage of a turbulent multitude.
 (41) The prudence of <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> conceived, and executed without delay, the most effectual measure for the relief of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 A large and seasonable supply of corn, collected in the inland provinces of Gaul, was embarked on the rapid stream of the Rhone, and transported by an easy navigation from the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> to the Tiber.
 During the whole term of the <NORP>African</NORP> war, the granaries of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were continually filled, her dignity was vindicated from the humiliating dependence, and the minds of an immense people were quieted by the calm confidence of peace and plenty.
(42) The <NORP>African</NORP> war, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>398</CARDINAL> The cause of Rome, and the conduct of the <NORP>African</NORP> war, were intrusted by <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> to a general active and ardent to avenge his private injuries on the head of the tyrant.
 The spirit of discord which prevailed in the house of <PERSON>Nabal</PERSON> had excited a deadly quarrel between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of his sons, <PERSON>Gildo</PERSON> and Mascezel.
(43) The usurper pursued, with implacable rage, the life of his younger brother, whose courage and abilities he feared; and Mascezel, oppressed by superior power, took refuge in the court of Milan; where he soon received the cruel intelligence that his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> innocent and helpless children had been murdered by their inhuman uncle.
 The affliction of the father was suspended only by the desire of revenge.
 The vigilant <PERSON>Stilicho</PERSON> already prepared to collect the naval and military forces of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire; and he had resolved, if the tyrant should be able to wage an equal and doubtful war, to march against him in person.
 But as <GPE>Italy</GPE> required his presence, and as it might be dangerous to weaken the defence of the frontier, he judged it more advisable that <PERSON>Mascezel</PERSON> should attempt this arduous adventure at the head of a chosen body of <NORP>Gallic</NORP> veterans, who had lately served under the standard of Eugenius.
 These troops, who were exhorted to convince the world that they could subvert, as well as defend, the throne of an usurper, consisted of the Jovian, the Herculian, and the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> legions; of the <NORP>Nervian</NORP> auxiliaries; of the soldiers who displayed in their banners the symbol of a lion; and of the troops which were distinguished by the auspicious names of Fortunate and Invincible.
 Yet such was the smallness of their establishments, or the difficulty of recruiting, that these <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> bands, (44) of high dignity and reputation in the service of Rome, amounted to no more than <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> thousand effective men.
(45) The fleet of galleys and transports sailed in tempestuous weather from the port of Pisa, in Tuscany,and steered their course to the little island of Capraria, which had borrowed that name from the wild goats, its original inhabitants, whose place was now occupied by a new colony of a strange and savage appearance.
 Such was the contempt of a profane magistrate for the monks of Capraria, who were revered by the pious <PERSON>Mascezel</PERSON> as the chosen servants of God.
 (47) Some of them were persuaded, by his entreaties, to embark on board the fleet; and it is observed, to the praise of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, that his days and nights were employed in prayer, fasting, and the occupation of singing psalms.
 The devout leader, who with such a reinforcement appeared confident of victory, avoided the dangerous rocks of Corsica, coasted along the eastern side of Sardinia, and secured his ships against the violence of the south wind, by casting anchor in the safe and capacious harbour of Cagliari, at the distance of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty miles from the <NORP>African</NORP> shores.
(48) Defeat and death of Gildo.
 A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>398</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Gildo</PERSON> was prepared to resist the invasion with all the forces of Africa.
 By the liberality of his gifts and promises, he endeavoured to secure the doubtful allegiance of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> soldiers, whilst he attracted to his standard the distant tribes of <GPE>Gaetulia</GPE> and Ethiopia.
 He proudly reviewed an army of seventy thousand men, and boasted, with the rash presumption which is the forerunner of disgrace, that his numerous cavalry would trample under their horses' feet the troops of Mascezel, and involve, in a cloud of burning sand, the natives of the cold regions of <GPE>Gaul</GPE> and Germany.
(49) But the <PERSON>Moor</PERSON> who commanded the legions of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was too well acquainted with the manners of the countrymen to entertain any serious apprehension of a naked and disorderly host of barbarians, whose left arm, instead of a shield, was protected only by a mantle; who were totally disarmed as soon as they had darted the javelin from their right hand; and whose horses had never been taught to bear the control, or to obey the guidance, of the bridle.
 He fixed his camp of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> thousand veterans in the face of a superior enemy, and, after the delay of three days, gave the signal of a general engagement.
 (50) As <PERSON>Mascezel</PERSON> advanced before the front with fair offers of peace and pardon, he encountered <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the foremost standard-bearers of the Africans, and, on his refusal to yield, struck him on the arm with his sword.
 The arm and the standard sunk under the weight of the blow, and the imaginary act of submission was hastily repeated by all the standards of the line.
 At this signal the disaffected cohorts proclaimed the name of their lawful sovereign; the barbarians, astonished by the defection of their <NORP>Roman</NORP> allies, dispersed, according to their custom, in tumultuary flight; and <PERSON>Mascezel</PERSON> obtained the honours of an easy and almost bloodless victory.
(51) The tyrant escaped from the field of battle to the sea-shore, and threw himself into a small vessel, with the hope of reaching in safety some friendly port of the empire of the East; but the obstinacy of the wind drove him back into the harbour of Tabraca,(52) which had acknowledged, with the rest of the province, the dominion of Honorius, and the authority of his lieutenant.
 The inhabitants, as a proof of their repentance and loyalty, seized and confined the person of <PERSON>Gildo</PERSON> in a dungeon; and his own despair saved him from the intolerable torture of supporting the presence of an injured and victorious brother.
 (53) The captives and the spoils of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were laid at the feet of the emperor; but Stilicho, whose moderation appeared more conspicuous and more sincere in the midst of prosperity, still affected to consult the laws of the republic, and referred to the senate and people of <GPE>Rome</GPE> the judgment of the most illustrious criminals.
(54) Their trial was public and solemn; but the judges, in the exercise of this obsolete and precarious jurisdiction, were impatient to punish the <NORP>African</NORP> magistrates who had intercepted the subsistence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 The rich and guilty province was oppressed by the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> ministers, who had a visible interest to multiply the number of the accomplices of Gildo; and if an edict of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> seems to check the malicious industry of informers, a subsequent edict, at the distance of ten years, continues and renews the prosecution of the offences which had been committed in the time of the general rebellion.
(55) The adherents of the tyrant who escaped the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fury of the soldiers and the judges might derive some consolation from the tragic fate of his brother, who could never obtain his pardon for the extraordinary services which he had performed.
 After he had finished an important war in the space of a single winter, <PERSON>Mascezel</PERSON> was received at the court of <GPE>Milan</GPE> with loud applause, affected gratitude, and secret jealousy;(56) and his death, which perhaps was the effect of accident, has been considered as the crime of Stilicho.
 In the passage of a bridge, the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> prince, who accompanied the master-general of the West, was suddenly thrown from his horse into the river; the officious haste of the attendants was restrained by a cruel and perfidious smile which they observed on the countenance of Stilicho; and while they delayed the necessary assistance, the unfortunate <PERSON>Mascezel</PERSON> was irrecoverably drowned.
(57) Marriage and character of Honorius, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>398</CARDINAL> The joy of the <NORP>African</NORP> triumph was happily connected with the nuptials of the emperor Honorius, and of his cousin Maria, the daughter of Stilicho; and this equal and honourable alliance seemed to invest the powerful minister with the authority of a parent over his submissive pupil.
 The muse of <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> was not silent on this propitious day; (58) he sung, in various and lively strains, the happiness of the royal pair, and the glory of the hero who confirmed their union and supported their throne.
 The ancient fables of Greece, which had almost ceased to be the object of religious faith, were saved from oblivion by the genius of poetry.
 The picture of the <NORP>Cyprian</NORP> grove, the seat of harmony and love; the triumphant progress of <LOC>Venus</LOC> over her native seas, and the mild influence which her presence diffused in the palace of Milan, express to every age the natural sentiments of the heart in the just and pleasing language of allegorical fiction.
 But the amorous impatience which <PERSON>Claudian</PERSON> attributes to the young prince(59) must excite the smiles of the court; and his beauteous spouse (if she deserved the praise of beauty) had not much to fear or to hope from the passions of her lover.
 <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was only in the fourteenth year of his age; Serena, the mother of his bride, deferred, by art or persuasion, the consummation of the royal nuptials; <PERSON>Maria</PERSON> died a virgin, after she had been ten years a wife; and the chastity of the emperor was secured by the coldness, or perhaps the debility, of his constitution.
(60) His subjects, who attentively studied the character of their young sovereign, discovered that <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was without passions, and consequently without talents; and that his feeble and languid disposition was alike incapable of discharging the duties of his rank, or of enjoying the pleasures of his age.
 In his early youth he made some progress in the exercises of riding and drawing the bow; but he soon relinquished these fatiguing occupations, and the amusement of feeding poultry became the serious and daily care of the monarch of the West,(61) who resigned the reins of empire to the firm and skilful hand of his guardian Stilicho.
 The experience of history will countenance the suspicion that a prince who was born in the purple received a worse education than the meanest peasant of his dominions, and that the ambitious minister suffered him to attain the age of manhood without attempting to excite his courage or to enlighten his understanding.
 (62) The predecessors of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> were accustomed to animate by their example, or at least by their presence, the valour of the legions; and the dates of their laws attest the perpetual activity of their motions through the provinces of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 But the son of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> passed the slumber of his life a captive in his palace, a stranger in his country, and the patient, almost the indifferent, spectator of the ruin of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, which was repeatedly attacked, and finally subverted, by the arms of the barbarians.
 In the eventful history of a reign of twenty-eight years, it will seldom be necessary to mention the name of the emperor Honorius.
