 Petrarch, A.
D.
 1304, June 19- 1374,July 19.
 In the apprehension of modern times, <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> (1) is the <NORP>Italian</NORP> songster of <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> and love.
 In the harmony of his <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> rhymes, <GPE>Italy</GPE> applauds, or rather adores, the father of her lyric poetry; and his verse, or at least his name, is repeated by the enthusiasm, or affectation, of amorous sensibility.
 Whatever may be the private taste of a stranger, his slight and superficial knowledge should humbly acquiesce in the judgment of a learned nation; yet I may hope or presume, that the <NORP>Italians</NORP> do not compare the tedious uniformity of sonnets and elegies with the sublime compositions of their epic muse, the original wildness of Dante, the regular beauties of Tasso, and the boundless variety of the incomparable Ariosto.
 The merits of the lover I am still less qualified to appreciate: nor am I deeply interested in a metaphysical passion for a nymph so shadowy, that her existence has been questioned; (2) for a matron so prolific, (3) that she was delivered of <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> legitimate children, (4) while her amorous swain sighed and sung at the fountain of Vaucluse.
 (5) But in the eyes of Petrarch, and those of his graver contemporaries, his love was a sin, and <NORP>Italian</NORP> verse a frivolous amusement.
 His <NORP>Latin</NORP> works of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, established his serious reputation, which was soon diffused from <GPE>Avignon</GPE> over <GPE>France</GPE> and Italy: his friends and disciples were multiplied in every city; and if the ponderous volume of his writings (6) be now abandoned to a long repose, our gratitude must applaud the man, who by precept and example revived the spirit and study of the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age.
 From his earliest youth, <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> aspired to the poetic crown.
 The academical honours of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> faculties had introduced a royal degree of master or doctor in the art of poetry; (7) and the title of poet- laureate, which custom, rather than vanity, perpetuates in the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> court, (8) was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invented by the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> of Germany.
 In the musical games of antiquity, a prize was bestowed on the victor: (9) the belief that <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> and <PERSON>Horace</PERSON> had been crowned in the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> inflamed the emulation of a <NORP>Latin</NORP> bard; (10) and the laurel (11) was endeared to the lover by a verbal resemblance with the name of his mistress.
 The value of either object was enhanced by the difficulties of the pursuit; and if the virtue or prudence of <PERSON>Laura</PERSON> was inexorable, (12) he enjoyed, and might boast of enjoying, the nymph of poetry.
 His vanity was not of the most delicate kind, since he applauds the success of his own labours; his name was popular; his friends were active; the open or secret opposition of envy and prejudice was surmounted by the dexterity of patient merit.
 In the thirty-sixth year of his age, he was solicited to accept the object of his wishes; and on the same day, in the solitude of Vaucluse, he received a similar and solemn invitation from the senate of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the university of Paris.
 The learning of a theological school, and the ignorance of a lawless city, were alike unqualified to bestow the ideal though immortal wreath which genius may obtain from the free applause of the public and of posterity: but the candidate dismissed this troublesome reflection; and after some moments of complacency and suspense, preferred the summons of the metropolis of the world.
 His poetic coronation at Rome, A.
D.
 1341,April 8.
 The ceremony of his coronation (13) was performed in the Capitol, by his friend and patron the supreme magistrate of the republic.
 <CARDINAL>Twelve</CARDINAL> patrician youths were arrayed in scarlet; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> representatives of the most illustrious families, in green robes, with garlands of flowers, accompanied the procession; in the midst of the princes and nobles, the senator, count of Anguillara, a kinsman of the Colonna, assumed his throne; and at the voice of a herald <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> arose.
 After discoursing on a text of Virgil, and thrice repeating his vows for the prosperity of Rome, he knelt before the throne, and received from the senator a laurel crown, with a more precious declaration, "This is the reward of merit.
" The people shouted, "Long life to the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> and the poet!" A sonnet in praise of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was accepted as the effusion of genius and gratitude; and after the whole procession had visited the Vatican, the profane wreath was suspended before the shrine of St.
 Peter.
 In the act or diploma (14) which was presented to Petrarch, the title and prerogatives of poet-laureate are revived in the Capitol, after the lapse of <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years; and he receives the perpetual privilege of wearing, at his choice, a crown of laurel, ivy, or myrtle, of assuming the poetic habit, and of teaching, disputing, interpreting, and composing, in all places whatsoever, and on all subjects of literature.
 The grant was ratified by the authority of the senate and people; and the character of citizen was the recompense of his affection for the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name.
 They did him honour, but they did him justice.
 In the familiar society of <PERSON>Cicero</PERSON> and Livy, he had imbibed the ideas of an ancient patriot; and his ardent fancy kindled every idea to a sentiment, and every sentiment to a passion.
 The aspect of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hills and their majestic ruins confirmed these lively impressions; and he loved a country by whose liberal spirit he had been crowned and adopted.
 The poverty and debasement of <GPE>Rome</GPE> excited the indignation and pity of her grateful son; he dissembled the faults of his fellow-citizens; applauded with partial fondness the last of their heroes and matrons; and in the remembrance of the past, in the hopes of the future, was pleased to forget the miseries of the present time.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was still the lawful mistress of the world: the pope and the emperor, the bishop and general, had abdicated their station by an inglorious retreat to the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and the Danube; but if she could resume her virtue, the republic might again vindicate her liberty and dominion.
 Amidst the indulgence of enthusiasm and eloquence, (15) Petrarch, Italy, and Europe, were astonished by a revolution which realized for a moment his most splendid visions.
 The rise and fall of the tribune <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> will occupy the following pages: (16) the subject is interesting, the materials are rich, and the glance of a patriot bard (17) will sometimes vivify the copious, but simple, narrative of the Florentine, (18) and more especially of the Roman, historian.
 (19) Birth, character, and patriotic designs of Rienzi.
 In a <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city which was inhabited only by mechanics and Jews, the marriage of an innkeeper and a washer woman produced the future deliverer of Rome.
 (20) From such parents <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> Gabrini could inherit neither dignity nor fortune; and the gift of a liberal education, which they painfully bestowed, was the cause of his glory and untimely end.
 The study of history and eloquence, the writings of Cicero, Seneca, Livy, Caesar, and Valerius Maximus, elevated above his equals and contemporaries the genius of the young plebeian: he perused with indefatigable diligence the manuscripts and marbles of antiquity; loved to dispense his knowledge in familiar language; and was often provoked to exclaim, When the republic addressed to the throne of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> an embassy of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> orders, the spirit and eloquence of <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> recommended him to a place among the <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> deputies of the commons.
 The orator had the honour of haranguing Pope <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Sixth, and the satisfaction of conversing with Petrarch, a congenial mind: but his aspiring hopes were chilled by disgrace and poverty and the patriot was reduced to a single garment and the charity of the hospital.
 From this misery he was relieved by the sense of merit or the smile of favour; and the employment of apostolic notary afforded him a daily stipend of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> gold florins, a more honourable and extensive connection, and the right of contrasting, both in words and actions, his own integrity with the vices of the state.
 The eloquence of <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was prompt and persuasive: the multitude is always prone to envy and censure: he was stimulated by the loss of a brother and the impunity of the assassins; nor was it possible to excuse or exaggerate the public calamities.
 The blessings of peace and justice, for which civil society has been instituted, were banished from Rome: the jealous citizens, who might have endured every personal or pecuniary injury, were most deeply wounded in the dishonour of their wives and daughters: (22) they were equally oppressed by the arrogance of the nobles and the corruption of the magistrates; and the abuse of arms or of laws was the only circumstance that distinguished the lions from the dogs and serpents of the Capitol.
 These allegorical emblems were variously repeated in the pictures which <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> exhibited in the streets and churches; and while the spectators gazed with curious wonder, the bold and ready orator unfolded the meaning, applied the satire, inflamed their passions, and announced a distant hope of comfort and deliverance.
 The privileges of Rome, her eternal sovereignty over her princes and provinces, was the theme of his public and private discourse; and a monument of servitude became in his hands a title and incentive of liberty.
 The decree of the senate, which granted the most ample prerogatives to the emperor Vespasian, had been inscribed on a copper plate still extant in the choir of the church of St.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> Lateran.
 (23) A numerous assembly of nobles and plebeians was invited to this political lecture, and a convenient theatre was erected for their reception.
 The notary appeared in a magnificent and mysterious habit, explained the inscription by a version and commentary, (24) and descanted with eloquence and zeal on the ancient glories of the senate and people, from whom all legal authority was derived.
 The supine ignorance of the nobles was incapable of discerning the serious tendency of such representations: they might sometimes chastise with words and blows the plebeian reformer; but he was often suffered in the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> palace to amuse the company with his threats and predictions; and the modern <PERSON>Brutus</PERSON> (25) was concealed under the mask of folly and the character of a buffoon.
 While they indulged their contempt, the restoration of the good estate, his favourite expression, was entertained among the people as a desirable, a possible, and at length as an approaching, event; and while all had the disposition to applaud, some had the courage to assist, their promised deliverer.
 he assumes the government of Rome, A.
D.
 1347, May 20; A prophecy, or rather a summons, affixed on the church door of St.
 George, was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> public evidence of his designs; a nocturnal assembly of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> citizens on Mount Aventine, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> step to their execution.
 After an oath of secrecy and aid, he represented to the conspirators the importance and facility of their enterprise; that the nobles, without union or resources, were strong only in the fear nobles, of their imaginary strength; that all power, as well as right, was in the hands of the people; that the revenues of the apostolical chamber might relieve the public distress; and that the pope himself would approve their victory over the common enemies of government and freedom.
 After securing a faithful band to protect his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> declaration, he proclaimed through the city, by sound of trumpet, that on the evening of the following day, all persons should assemble without arms before the church of St.
 Angelo, to provide for the reestablishment of the good estate.
 The whole night was employed in the celebration of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> masses of the Holy Ghost; and in the morning, Rienzi, bareheaded, but in complete armour, issued from the church, encompassed by the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> conspirators.
 The pope's vicar, the simple bishop of Orvieto, who had been persuaded to sustain a part in this singular ceremony, marched on his right hand; and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> great standards were borne aloft as the emblems of their design.
 In the first, the banner of liberty, <GPE>Rome</GPE> was seated on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> lions, with a palm in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hand and a globe in the other; St.
 Paul, with a drawn sword, was delineated in the banner of justice; and in the third, St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> held the keys of concord and peace.
 <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was encouraged by the presence and applause of an innumerable crowd, who understood little, and hoped much; and the procession slowly rolled forwards from the castle of St.
 Angelo to the Capitol.
 His triumph was disturbed by some secret emotions which he labored to suppress: he ascended without opposition, and with seeming confidence, the citadel of the republic; harangued the people from the balcony; and received the most flattering confirmation of his acts and laws.
 The nobles, as if destitute of arms and counsels, beheld in silent consternation this strange revolution; and the moment had been prudently chosen, when the most formidable, <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> Colonna, was absent from the city.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rumour, he returned to his palace, affected to despise this plebeian tumult, and declared to the messenger of Rienzi, that at his leisure he would cast the madman from the windows of the Capitol.
 The great bell instantly rang an alarm, and so rapid was the tide, so urgent was the danger, that <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> escaped with precipitation to the suburb of St.
 Laurence: from thence, after a moment's refreshment, he continued the same speedy career till he reached in safety his castle of Palestrina; lamenting his own imprudence, which had not trampled the spark of this mighty conflagration.
 A general and peremptory order was issued from the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> to all the nobles, that they should peaceably retire to their estates: they obeyed; and their departure secured the tranquillity of the free and obedient citizens of Rome.
 with the title and office of tribune.
 But such voluntary obedience evaporates with the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> transports of zeal; and <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> felt the importance of justifying his usurpation by a regular form and a legal title.
 At his own choice, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people would have displayed their attachment and authority, by lavishing on his head the names of senator or consul, of king or emperor: he preferred the ancient and modest appellation of tribune; the protection of the commons was the essence of that sacred office; and they were ignorant, that it had never been invested with any share in the legislative or executive powers of the republic.
 Laws of the good estate.
 In this character, and with the consent of the Roman, the tribune enacted the most salutary laws for the restoration and maintenance of the good estate.
 By the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> he fulfils the wish of honesty and inexperience, that no civil suit should be protracted beyond the term of fifteen days.
 The danger of frequent perjury might justify the pronouncing against a false accuser the same penalty which his evidence would have inflicted: the disorders of the times might compel the legislator to punish every homicide with death, and every injury with equal retaliation.
 But the execution of justice was hopeless till he had previously abolished the tyranny of the nobles.
 It was formally provided, that none, except the supreme magistrate, should possess or command the gates, bridges, or towers of the state; that no private garrisons should be introduced into the towns or castles of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> territory; that none should bear arms, or presume to fortify their houses in the city or country; that the barons should be responsible for the safety of the highways, and the free passage of provisions; and that the protection of malefactors and robbers should be expiated by a fine of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> marks of silver.
 But these regulations would have been impotent and nugatory, had not the licentious nobles been awed by the sword of the civil power.
 A sudden alarm from the bell of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> could still summon to the standard above <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> volunteers: the support of the tribune and the laws required a more regular and permanent force.
 In each harbour of the coast a vessel was stationed for the assurance of commerce; a standing militia of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty horse and <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> foot was levied, clothed, and paid in the <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> quarters of the city: and the spirit of a commonwealth may be traced in the grateful allowance of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> florins, or pounds, to the heirs of every soldier who lost his life in the service of his country.
 For the maintenance of the public defence, for the establishment of granaries, for the relief of widows, orphans, and indigent convents, <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> applied, without fear of sacrilege, the revenues of the apostolic chamber: the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> branches of hearth-money, the salt-duty, and the customs, were each of the <DATE>annual</DATE> produce of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> florins; (26) and scandalous were the abuses, if in <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months the amount of the salt-duty could be trebled by his judicious economy.
 After thus restoring the forces and finances of the republic, the tribune recalled the nobles from their solitary independence; required their personal appearance in the Capitol; and imposed an oath of allegiance to the new government, and of submission to the laws of the good estate.
 Apprehensive for their safety, but still more apprehensive of the danger of a refusal, the princes and barons returned to their houses at <GPE>Rome</GPE> in the garb of simple and peaceful citizens: the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> and Ursini, the <PERSON>Savelli</PERSON> and Frangipani, were confounded before the tribunal of a plebeian, of the vile buffoon whom they had so often derided, and their disgrace was aggravated by the indignation which they vainly struggled to disguise.
 The same oath was successively pronounced by the several orders of society, the clergy and gentlemen, the judges and notaries, the merchants and artisans, and the gradual descent was marked by the increase of sincerity and zeal.
 They swore to live and die with the republic and the church, whose interest was artfully united by the nominal association of the bishop of Orvieto, the pope's vicar, to the office of tribune.
 It was the boast of Rienzi, that he had delivered the throne and patrimony of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> from a rebellious aristocracy; and <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Sixth, who rejoiced in its fall, affected to believe the professions, to applaud the merits, and to confirm the title, of his trusty servant.
 The speech, perhaps the mind, of the tribune, was inspired with a lively regard for the purity of the faith: he insinuated his claim to a supernatural mission from the Holy Ghost; enforced by a heavy forfeiture the <DATE>annual</DATE> duty of confession and communion; and strictly guarded the spiritual as well as temporal welfare of his faithful people.
 (27) Freedom and prosperity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> republic.
 Never perhaps has the energy and effect of a single mind been more remarkably felt than in the sudden, though transient, reformation of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the tribune Rienzi.
 A den of robbers was converted to the discipline of a camp or convent: patient to hear, swift to redress, inexorable to punish, his tribunal was always accessible to the poor and stranger; nor could birth, or dignity, or the immunities of the church, protect the offender or his accomplices.
 The privileged houses, the private sanctuaries in Rome, on which no officer of justice would presume to trespass, were abolished; and he applied the timber and iron of their barricades in the fortifications of the Capitol.
 The venerable father of the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> was exposed in his own palace to the double shame of being desirous, and of being unable, to protect a criminal.
 A mule, with a jar of oil, had been stolen near Capranica; and the lord of the <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> family was condemned to restore the damage, and to discharge a fine of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> florins for his negligence in guarding the highways.
 Nor were the persons of the barons more inviolate than their lands or houses; and, either from accident or design, the same impartial rigour was exercised against the heads of the adverse factions.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> Agapet Colonna, who had himself been senator of Rome, was arrested in the street for injury or debt; and justice was appeased by the tardy execution of <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> Ursini, who, among his various acts of violence and rapine, had pillaged a shipwrecked vessel at the mouth of the Tyber.
 (28) His name, the purple of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> cardinals, his uncles, a recent marriage, and a mortal disease were disregarded by the inflexible tribune, who had chosen his victim.
 The public officers dragged him from his palace and nuptial bed: his trial was short and satisfactory: the bell of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> convened the people: stripped of his mantle, on his knees, with his hands bound behind his back, he heard the sentence of death; and after a brief confession, <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> was led away to the gallows.
 After such an example, none who were conscious of guilt could hope for impunity, and the flight of the wicked, the licentious, and the idle, soon purified the city and territory of Rome.
 In this time (says the historian,) the woods began to rejoice that they were no longer infested with robbers; the oxen began to plough; the pilgrims visited the sanctuaries; the roads and inns were replenished with travellers; trade, plenty, and good faith, were restored in the markets; and a purse of gold might be exposed without danger in the midst of the highway.
 As soon as the life and property of the subject are secure, the labours and rewards of industry spontaneously revive: <GPE>Rome</GPE> was still the metropolis of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world; and the fame and fortunes of the tribune were diffused in every country by the strangers who had enjoyed the blessings of his government.
 The tribune is respected in Italy, etc.
 The deliverance of his country inspired <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> with a vast, and perhaps visionary, idea of uniting <GPE>Italy</GPE> in a great federative republic, of which <GPE>Rome</GPE> should be the ancient and lawful head, and the free cities and princes the members and associates.
 His pen was not less eloquent than his tongue; and his numerous epistles were delivered to swift and trusty messengers.
 On foot, with a white wand in their hand, they traversed the forests and mountains; enjoyed, in the most hostile states, the sacred security of ambassadors; and reported, in the style of flattery or truth, that the highways along their passage were lined with kneeling multitudes, who implored Heaven for the success of their undertaking.
 Could passion have listened to reason; could private interest have yielded to the public welfare; the supreme tribunal and confederate union of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> republic might have healed their intestine discord, and closed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> against the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of the North.
 But the propitious season had elapsed; and if Venice, Florence, Sienna, Perugia, and many inferior cities offered their lives and fortunes to the good estate, the tyrants of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> and <GPE>Tuscany</GPE> must despise, or hate, the plebeian author of a free constitution.
 From them, however, and from every part of Italy, the tribune received the most friendly and respectful answers: they were followed by the ambassadors of the princes and republics; and in this foreign conflux, on all the occasions of pleasure or business, the low born notary could assume the familiar or majestic courtesy of a sovereign.
 (29) The most glorious circumstance of his reign was an appeal to his justice from Lewis, king of Hungary, who complained, that his brother and her husband had been perfidiously strangled by Jane, queen of Naples: (30) her guilt or innocence was pleaded in a solemn trial at Rome; but after hearing the advocates, (31) the tribune adjourned this weighty and invidious cause, which was soon determined by the sword of the Hungarian.
 Beyond the Alps, more especially at Avignon, the revolution was the theme of curiosity, wonder, and applause.
 and celebrated by Petrarch.
 <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> had been the private friend, perhaps the secret counsellor, of Rienzi: his writings breathe the most ardent spirit of patriotism and joy; and all respect for the pope, all gratitude for the Colonna, was lost in the superior duties of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizen.
 The poet-laureate of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> maintains the act, applauds the hero, and mingles with some apprehension and advice, the most lofty hopes of the permanent and rising greatness of the republic.
 (32) His vices and follies.
 While <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> indulged these prophetic visions, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> hero was fast declining from the meridian of fame and power; and the people, who had gazed with astonishment on the ascending meteor, began to mark the irregularity of its course, and the vicissitudes of light and obscurity.
 More eloquent than judicious, more enterprising than resolute, the faculties of <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> were not balanced by cool and commanding reason: he magnified in a tenfold proportion the objects of hope and fear; and prudence, which could not have erected, did not presume to fortify, his throne.
 In the blaze of prosperity, his virtues were insensibly tinctured with the adjacent vices; justice with cruelly, cruelty, liberality with profusion, and the desire of fame with puerile and ostentatious vanity.
 He might have learned, that the ancient tribunes, so strong and sacred in the public opinion, were not distinguished in style, habit, or appearance, from an ordinary plebeian; (33) and that as often as they visited the city on foot, a single viator, or beadle, attended the exercise of their office.
 The <PERSON>Gracchi</PERSON> would have frowned or smiled, could they have read the sonorous titles and epithets of their successor,"NICHOLAS, SEVERE AND MERCIFUL; DELIVERER OF ROME; DEFENDER OF ITALY; (34) FRIEND OF MANKIND, AND OF LIBERTY, PEACE, AND JUSTICE; <ORG>TRIBUNE</ORG> AUGUST:"his theatrical pageants had prepared the revolution; but <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> abused, in luxury and pride, the political maxim of speaking to the eyes, as well as the understanding, of the multitude.
 From nature he had received the gift of a handsome person, (35) till it was swelled and disfigured by intemperance: and his propensity to laughter was corrected in the magistrate by the affectation of gravity and sternness.
 He was clothed, at least on public occasions, in a party-colored robe of velvet or satin, lined with fur, and embroidered with gold: the rod of justice, which he carried in his hand, was a sceptre of polished steel, crowned with a globe and cross of gold, and enclosing a small fragment of the true and holy wood.
 In his civil and religious processions through the city, he rode on a white steed, the symbol of royalty: the great banner of the republic, a sun with a circle of stars, a dove with an olive branch, was displayed over his head; a shower of gold and silver was scattered among the populace, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> guards with halberds encompassed his person; a troop of horse preceded his march; and their tymbals and trumpets were of massy silver.
 The pomp of his knighthood, A.
D.
 1347,August 1.
 The ambition of the honours of chivalry (36) betrayed the meanness of his birth, and degraded the importance of his office; and the equestrian tribune was not less odious to the nobles, whom he adopted, than to the plebeians, whom he deserted.
 All that yet remained of treasure, or luxury, or art, was exhausted on that solemn day.
 <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> led the procession from the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> to the Lateran; the tediousness of the way was relieved with decorations and games; the ecclesiastical, civil, and military orders marched under their various banners; the <NORP>Roman</NORP> ladies attended his wife; and the ambassadors of <GPE>Italy</GPE> might loudly applaud or secretly deride the novelty of the pomp.
 In the evening, which they had reached the church and palace of Constantine, he thanked and dismissed the numerous assembly, with an invitation to the festival of the ensuing day.
 From the hands of a venerable knight he received the order of the Holy Ghost; the purification of the bath was a previous ceremony; but in no step of his life did <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> excite such scandal and censure as by the profane use of the porphyry vase, in which <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> (a foolish legend) had been healed of his leprosy by Pope Sylvester.
 (37) With equal presumption the tribune watched or reposed within the consecrated precincts of the baptistery; and the failure of his state-bed was interpreted as an omen of his approaching downfall.
 At the hour of worship, he showed himself to the returning crowds in a majestic attitude, with a robe of purple, his sword, and gilt spurs; but the holy rites were soon interrupted by his levity and insolence.
 Rising from his throne, and advancing towards the congregation, he proclaimed in a loud voice: Unsheathing his maiden sword, he thrice brandished it to the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> parts of the world, and thrice repeated the extravagant declaration, "And this too is mine!" The pope's vicar, the bishop of Orvieto, attempted to check this career of folly; but his feeble protest was silenced by martial music; and instead of withdrawing from the assembly, he consented to dine with his brother tribune, at a table which had hitherto been reserved for the supreme pontiff.
 A banquet, such as the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> had given, was prepared for the Romans.
 The apartments, porticos, and courts of the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> were spread with innumerable tables for either sex, and every condition; a stream of wine flowed from the nostrils of Constantine's brazen horse; no complaint, except of the scarcity of water, could be heard; and the licentiousness of the multitude was curbed by discipline and fear.
 and coronation.
 A subsequent day was appointed for the coronation of Rienzi; (40) <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> crowns of different leaves or metals were successively placed on his head by the most eminent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> clergy; they represented the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> gifts of the Holy Ghost; and he still professed to imitate the example of the ancient tribunes.
 These extraordinary spectacles might deceive or flatter the people; and their own vanity was gratified in the vanity of their leader.
 But in his private life he soon deviated from the strict rule of frugality and abstinence; and the plebeians, who were awed by the splendour of the nobles, were provoked by the luxury of their equal.
 His wife, his son, his uncle, (a barber in name and profession,) exposed the contrast of vulgar manners and princely expense; and without acquiring the majesty, <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> degenerated into the vices, of a king.
 Fear and hatred of the nobles of Rome.
 A simple citizen describes with pity, or perhaps with pleasure, the humiliation of the barons of Rome.
 "Bareheaded, their hands crossed on their breast, they stood with downcast looks in the presence of the tribune; and they trembled, good God, how they trembled!" (41) As long as the yoke of <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was that of justice and their country, their conscience forced them to esteem the man, whom pride and interest provoked them to hate: his extravagant conduct soon fortified their hatred by contempt; and they conceived the hope of subverting a power which was no longer so deeply rooted in the public confidence.
 The old animosity of the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> was suspended for a moment by their common disgrace: they associated their wishes, and perhaps their designs; an assassin was seized and tortured; he accused the nobles; and as soon as <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> deserved the fate, he adopted the suspicions and maxims, of a tyrant.
 On the same day, under various pretences, he invited to the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> his principal enemies, among whom were <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> members of the <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> of the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> name.
 But instead of a council or a banquet, they found themselves prisoners under the sword of despotism or justice; and the consciousness of innocence or guilt might inspire them with equal apprehensions of danger.
 At the sound of the great bell the people assembled; they were arraigned for a conspiracy against the tribune's life; and though some might sympathize in their distress, not a hand, nor a voice, was raised to rescue the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the nobility from their impending doom.
 Their apparent boldness was prompted by despair; they passed in separate chambers a sleepless and painful night; and the venerable hero, <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> Colonna, striking against the door of his prison, repeatedly urged his guards to deliver him by a speedy death from such ignominious servitude.
 In the morning they understood their sentence from the visit of a confessor and the tolling of the bell.
 The great hall of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> had been decorated for the bloody scene with red and white hangings: the countenance of the tribune was dark and severe; the swords of the executioners were unsheathed; and the barons were interrupted in their dying speeches by the sound of trumpets.
 But in this decisive moment, <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was not less anxious or apprehensive than his captives: he dreaded the splendour of their names, their surviving kinsmen, the inconstancy of the people the reproaches of the world, and, after rashly offering a mortal injury, he vainly presumed that, if he could forgive, he might himself be forgiven.
 His elaborate oration was that of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> and a suppliant; and, as the humble minister of the commons, he entreated his masters to pardon these noble criminals, for whose repentance and future service he pledged his faith and authority.
 "If you are spared," said the tribune, "by the mercy of the Romans, will you not promise to support the good estate with your lives and fortunes?" Astonished by this marvellous clemency, the barons bowed their heads; and while they devoutly repeated the oath of allegiance, might whisper a secret, and more sincere, assurance of revenge.
 A priest, in the name of the people, pronounced their absolution: they received the communion with the tribune, assisted at the banquet, followed the procession; and, after every spiritual and temporal sign of reconciliation, were dismissed in safety to their respective homes, with the new honours and titles of generals, consuls, and patricians.
 (42) They oppose <PERSON>Reinzi</PERSON> in arms.
 During some weeks they were checked by the memory of their danger, rather than of their deliverance, till the most powerful of the Ursini, escaping with the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> from the city, erected at <PERSON>Marino</PERSON> the standard of rebellion.
 The fortifications of the castle were instantly restored; the vassals attended their lord; the outlaws armed against the magistrate; the flocks and herds, the harvests and vineyards, from <PERSON>Marino</PERSON> to the gates of Rome, were swept away or destroyed; and the people arraigned <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> as the author of the calamities which his government had taught them to forget.
 In the camp, <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> appeared to less advantage than in the rostrum; and he neglected the progress of the rebel barons till their numbers were strong, and their castles impregnable.
 From the pages of <WORK_OF_ART>Livy</WORK_OF_ART> he had not imbibed the art, or even the courage, of a general: an army of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Romans</NORP> returned without honour or effect from the attack of Marino; and his vengeance was amused by painting his enemies, their heads downwards, and drowning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> dogs (at least they should have been bears) as the representatives of the Ursini.
 The belief of his incapacity encouraged their operations: they were invited by their secret adherents; and the barons attempted, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot, and sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horse, to enter <GPE>Rome</GPE> by force or surprise.
 The city was prepared for their reception; the alarm-bell rung all night; the gates were strictly guarded, or insolently open; and after some hesitation they sounded a retreat.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> divisions had passed along the walls, but the prospect of a free entrance tempted the headstrong valour of the nobles in the rear; and after a successful skirmish, they were overthrown and massacred without <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> by the crowds of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Defeat and death of the Colonna,(Nov.
 20.
) <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> the younger, the noble spirit to whom <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> ascribed the restoration of Italy, was preceded or accompanied in death by his son John, a gallant youth, by his brother Peter, who might regret the ease and honours of the church, by a nephew of legitimate birth, and by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bastards of the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> race; and the number of seven, the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> crowns, as <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> styled them, of the Holy Ghost, was completed by the agony of the deplorable parent, and the veteran chief, who had survived the hope and fortune of his house.
 The vision and prophecies of St.
 <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> and Pope Boniface had been used by the tribune to animate his troops: (43) he displayed, at least in the pursuit, the spirit of a hero; but he forgot the maxims of the ancient Romans, who abhorred the triumphs of civil war.
 The conqueror ascended the Capitol; deposited his crown and sceptre on the altar; and boasted, with some truth, that he had cut off an ear, which neither pope nor emperor had been able to amputate.
 (44) His base and implacable revenge denied the honours of burial; and the bodies of the Colonna, which he threatened to expose with those of the vilest malefactors, were secretly interred by the holy virgins of their name and family.
 (45) The people sympathized in their grief, repented of their own fury, and detested the indecent joy of Rienzi, who visited the spot where these illustrious victims had fallen.
 It was on that fatal spot that he conferred on his son the honour of knighthood: and the ceremony was accomplished by a slight blow from each of the horsemen of the guard, and by a ridiculous and inhuman ablution from a pool of water, which was yet polluted with patrician blood.
 (46) Fall and flight of the tribune Rienzi, A.
D.
 1347, Dec.
 15.
 A short delay would have saved the Colonna, the delay of a single month, which elapsed between the triumph and the exile of Rienzi.
 In the pride of victory, he forfeited what yet remained of his civil virtues, without acquiring the fame of military prowess.
 A free and vigorous opposition was formed in the city; and when the tribune proposed in the public council (47) to impose a new tax, and to regulate the government of Perugia, <CARDINAL>thirty-nine</CARDINAL> members voted against his measures; repelled the injurious charge of treachery and corruption; and urged him to prove, by their forcible exclusion, that if the populace adhered to his cause, it was already disclaimed by the most respectable citizens.
 The pope and the sacred college had never been dazzled by his specious professions; they were justly offended by the insolence of his conduct; a cardinal legate was sent to Italy, and after some fruitless treaty, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> personal interviews, he fulminated a bull of excommunication, in which the tribune is degraded from his office, and branded with the guilt of rebellion, sacrilege, and heresy.
 (48) The surviving barons of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were now humbled to a sense of allegiance; their interest and revenge engaged them in the service of the church; but as the fate of the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> was before their eyes, they abandoned to a private adventurer the peril and glory of the revolution.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> Pepin, count of Minorbino, (49) in the kingdom of Naples, had been condemned for his crimes, or his riches, to perpetual imprisonment; and Petrarch, by soliciting his release, indirectly contributed to the ruin of his friend.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> soldiers, the count of <PERSON>Minorbino</PERSON> introduced himself into Rome; barricaded the <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Colonna: and found the enterprise as easy as it had seemed impossible.
 From the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> alarm, the bell of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> incessantly tolled; but, instead of repairing to the well-known sound, the people were silent and inactive; and the pusillanimous Rienzi, deploring their ingratitude with sighs and tears, abdicated the government and palace of the republic.
 Revolutions of Rome, A.
D.
 1347-1354.
 Without drawing his sword, count <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> restored the aristocracy and the church; <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> senators were chosen, and the legate, assuming the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rank, accepted his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> colleagues from the rival families of <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> and Ursini.
 The acts of the tribune were abolished, his head was proscribed; yet such was the terror of his name, that the barons hesitated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before they would trust themselves in the city, and <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was left above a month in the castle of St.
 Angelo, from whence he peaceably withdrew, after laboring, without effect, to revive the affection and courage of the Romans.
 The vision of freedom and empire had vanished: their fallen spirit would have acquiesced in servitude, had it been smoothed by tranquillity and order; and it was scarcely observed, that the new senators derived their authority from the Apostolic See; that <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> cardinals were appointed to reform, with dictatorial power, the state of the republic.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was again agitated by the bloody feuds of the barons, who detested each other, and despised the commons: their hostile fortresses, both in town and country, again rose, and were again demolished: and the peaceful citizens, a flock of sheep, were devoured, says the <NORP>Florentine</NORP> historian, by these rapacious wolves.
 But when their pride and avarice had exhausted the patience of the Romans, a confraternity of the Virgin Mary protected or avenged the republic: the bell of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> was again tolled, the nobles in arms trembled in the presence of an unarmed multitude; and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> senators, <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> escaped from the window of the palace, and <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> was stoned at the foot of the altar.
 The dangerous office of tribune was successively occupied by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> plebeians, <PERSON>Cerroni</PERSON> and Baroncelli.
 The mildness of <PERSON>Cerroni</PERSON> was unequal to the times; and after a faint struggle, he retired with a fair reputation and a decent fortune to the comforts of rural life.
 Devoid of eloquence or genius, <PERSON>Baroncelli</PERSON> was distinguished by a resolute spirit: he spoke the language of a patriot, and trod in the footsteps of tyrants; his suspicion was a sentence of death, and his own death was the reward of his cruelties.
 Amidst the public misfortunes, the faults of <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> were forgotten; and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> sighed for the peace and prosperity of their good estate.
 (50) Adventures of Rienzi.
 After an exile of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> deliverer was again restored to his country.
 In the disguise of a monk or a pilgrim, he escaped from the castle of St.
 Angelo, implored the friendship of the king of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> at Naples, tempted the ambition of every bold adventurer, mingled at <GPE>Rome</GPE> with the pilgrims of the jubilee, lay concealed among the hermits of the Apennine, and wandered through the cities of Italy, Germany, and Bohemia.
 His person was invisible, his name was yet formidable; and the anxiety of the court of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> supposes, and even magnifies, his personal merit.
 The emperor Charles the <ORDINAL>Fourth</ORDINAL> gave audience to a stranger, who frankly revealed himself as the tribune of the republic; and astonished an assembly of ambassadors and princes, by the eloquence of a patriot and the visions of a prophet, the downfall of tyranny and the kingdom of the Holy Ghost.
 (51) Whatever had been his hopes, <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> found himself a captive; but he supported a character of independence and dignity, and obeyed, as his own choice, the irresistible summons of the supreme pontiff.
 The zeal of Petrarch, which had been cooled by the unworthy conduct, was rekindled by the sufferings and the presence, of his friend; and he boldly complains of the times, in which the saviour of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was delivered by her emperor into the hands of her bishop.
 A prisoner at Avignon, (A.
D.
 1351.
) <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was transported slowly, but in safe custody, from <GPE>Prague</GPE> to Avignon: his entrance into the city was that of a malefactor; in his prison he was chained by the leg; and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> cardinals were named to inquire into the crimes of heresy and rebellion.
 But his trial and condemnation would have involved some questions, which it was more prudent to leave under the veil of mystery: the temporal supremacy of the popes; the duty of residence; the civil and ecclesiastical privileges of the clergy and people of Rome.
 The reigning pontiff well deserved the appellation of Clement: the strange vicissitudes and magnanimous spirit of the captive excited his pity and esteem; and <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> believes that he respected in the hero the name and sacred character of a poet.
 (52) <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was indulged with an easy confinement and the use of books; and in the assiduous study of <WORK_OF_ART>Livy</WORK_OF_ART> and the Bible, he sought the cause and the consolation of his misfortunes.
 Rienzi, senator of Rome, A.
D.
 1354.
 The succeeding pontificate of Innocent the <ORDINAL>Sixth</ORDINAL> opened a new prospect of his deliverance and restoration; and the court of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> was persuaded, that the successful rebel could alone appease and reform the anarchy of the metropolis.
 After a solemn profession of fidelity, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tribune was sent into Italy, with the title of senator; but the death of <PERSON>Baroncelli</PERSON> appeared to supersede the use of his mission; and the legate, Cardinal Albornoz, (53) a consummate statesman, allowed him with reluctance, and without aid, to undertake the perilous experiment.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> reception was equal to his wishes: the day of his entrance was a public festival; and his eloquence and authority revived the laws of the good estate.
 But this momentary sunshine was soon clouded by his own vices and those of the people: in the Capitol, he might often regret the prison of Avignon; and after a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> administration of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> months, <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was massacred in a tumult which had been fomented by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> barons.
 In the society of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> and Bohemians, he is said to have contracted the habits of intemperance and cruelty: adversity had chilled his enthusiasm, without fortifying his reason or virtue; and that youthful hope, that lively assurance, which is the pledge of success, was now succeeded by the cold impotence of distrust and despair.
 The tribune had reigned with absolute dominion, by the choice, and in the hearts, of the Romans: the senator was the servile minister of a foreign court; and while he was suspected by the people, he was abandoned by the prince.
 The legate Albornoz, who seemed desirous of his ruin, inflexibly refused all supplies of men and money; a faithful subject could no longer presume to touch the revenues of the apostolical chamber; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> idea of a tax was the signal of clamour and sedition.
 Even his justice was tainted with the guilt or reproach of selfish cruelty: the most virtuous citizen of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was sacrificed to his jealousy; and in the execution of a public robber, from whose purse he had been assisted, the magistrate too much forgot, or too much remembered, the obligations of the debtor.
 (54) A civil war exhausted his treasures, and the patience of the city: the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> maintained their hostile station at Palestrina; and his mercenaries soon despised a leader whose ignorance and fear were envious of all subordinate merit.
 In the death, as in the life, of Rienzi, the hero and the coward were strangely mingled.
 When the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> was invested by a furious multitude, when he was basely deserted by his civil and military servants, the intrepid senator, waving the banner of liberty, presented himself on the balcony, addressed his eloquence to the various passions of the Romans, and labored to persuade them, that in the same cause himself and the republic must either stand or fall.
 His oration was interrupted by a volley of imprecations and stones; and after an arrow had transpierced his hand, he sunk into abject despair, and fled weeping to the inner chambers, from whence he was let down by a sheet before the windows of the prison.
 Destitute of aid or hope, he was besieged till the evening: the doors of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> were destroyed with axes and fire; and while the senator attempted to escape in a plebeian habit, he was discovered and dragged to the platform of the palace, the fatal scene of his judgments and executions.
 His death, (A.
D.
 1354, September 8.
) A whole hour, without voice or motion, he stood amidst the multitude <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> naked and <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> dead: their rage was hushed into curiosity and wonder: the last feelings of reverence and compassion yet struggled in his favour; and they might have prevailed, if a bold assassin had not plunged a dagger in his breast.
 He fell senseless with the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> stroke: the impotent revenge of his enemies inflicted a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> wounds: and the senator's body was abandoned to the dogs, to the Jews, and to the flames.
 Posterity will compare the virtues and failings of this extraordinary man; but in a long period of anarchy and servitude, the name of <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> has often been celebrated as the deliverer of his country, and the last of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> patriots.
 (55) <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> invites and upbraids the emperor Charles IV.
 A.
D.
 1355, January-May.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most generous wish of <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> was the restoration of a free republic; but after the exile and death of his plebeian hero, he turned his eyes from the tribune, to the king, of the Romans.
 The <FAC>Capitol</FAC> was yet stained with the blood of Rienzi, when Charles the <ORDINAL>Fourth</ORDINAL> descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to obtain the <NORP>Italian</NORP> and <ORG>Imperial</ORG> crowns.
 In his passage through <GPE>Milan</GPE> he received the visit, and repaid the flattery, of the poet-laureate; accepted a medal of Augustus; and promised, without a smile, to imitate the founder of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarchy.
 A false application of the name and maxims of antiquity was the source of the hopes and disappointments of Petrarch; yet he could not overlook the difference of times and characters; the immeasurable distance between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> and a <NORP>Bohemian</NORP> prince, who by the favour of the clergy had been elected the titular head of the <NORP>German</NORP> aristocracy.
 Instead of restoring to <GPE>Rome</GPE> her glory and her provinces, he had bound himself by a secret treaty with the pope, to evacuate the city on the day of his coronation; and his shameful retreat was pursued by the reproaches of the patriot bard.
 (56) He solicits the popes of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> to fix their residence at Rome.
 After the loss of liberty and empire, his <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> and more humble wish was to reconcile the shepherd with his flock; to recall the <NORP>Roman</NORP> bishop to his ancient and peculiar diocese.
 In the fervour of youth, with the authority of age, <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> addressed his exhortations to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> successive popes, and his eloquence was always inspired by the enthusiasm of sentiment and the freedom of language.
 (57) The son of a citizen of <GPE>Florence</GPE> invariably preferred the country of his birth to that of his education; and Italy, in his eyes, was the queen and garden of the world.
 Amidst her domestic factions, she was doubtless superior to <GPE>France</GPE> both in art and science, in wealth and politeness; but the difference could scarcely support the epithet of barbarous, which he promiscuously bestows on the countries beyond the Alps.
 Avignon, the mystic Babylon, the sink of vice and corruption, was the object of his hatred and contempt; but he forgets that her scandalous vices were not the growth of the soil, and that in every residence they would adhere to the power and luxury of the papal court.
 He confesses that the successor of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> is the bishop of the universal church; yet it was not on the banks of the Rhone, but of the Tyber, that the apostle had fixed his everlasting throne; and while every city in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world was blessed with a bishop, the metropolis alone was desolate and forlorn.
 Since the removal of the Holy See, the sacred buildings of the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> and the Vatican, their altars and their saints, were left in a state of poverty and decay; and <GPE>Rome</GPE> was often painted under the image of a disconsolate matron, as if the wandering husband could be reclaimed by the homely portrait of the age and infirmities of his weeping spouse.
 (58) But the cloud which hung over the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hills would be dispelled by the presence of their lawful sovereign: eternal fame, the prosperity of Rome, and the peace of Italy, would be the recompense of the pope who should dare to embrace this generous resolution.
 Of the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> whom <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> exhorted, the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> first, <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Twenty-second, <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> the Twelfth, and <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Sixth, were importuned or amused by the boldness of the orator; but the memorable change which had been attempted by <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> was finally accomplished by <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Eleventh.
 The execution of their design was opposed by weighty and almost insuperable obstacles.
 A king of France, who has deserved the epithet of wise, was unwilling to release them from a local dependence: the cardinals, for the most part his subjects, were attached to the language, manners, and climate of Avignon; to their stately palaces; above all, to the wines of Burgundy.
 In their eyes, <GPE>Italy</GPE> was foreign or hostile; and they reluctantly embarked at Marseilles, as if they had been sold or banished into the land of the Saracens.
 Return of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> V.
 (A.
D.
 1367, October 16-1370, April 17.
) <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> resided <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> with safety and honour: his sanctity was protected by a guard of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse; and the king of Cyprus, the queen of Naples, and the emperors of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, devoutly saluted their common father in the chair of St.
 Peter.
 But the joy of <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> and the <NORP>Italians</NORP> was soon turned into grief and indignation.
 Some reasons of public or private moment, his own impatience or the prayers of the cardinals, recalled <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> to France; and the approaching election was saved from the tyrannic patriotism of the Romans.
 The powers of heaven were interested in their cause: <PERSON>Bridget</PERSON> of Sweden, a saint and pilgrim, disapproved the return, and foretold the death, of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the Fifth: Final return of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> XI.
 (A.
D.
 1377, January 17.
) the migration of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <DATE>Eleventh</DATE> was encouraged by St.
 Catherine of Sienna, the spouse of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and ambassadress of the Florentines; and the popes themselves, the great masters of human credulity, appear to have listened to these visionary females.
 (59) Yet those celestial admonitions were supported by some arguments of temporal policy.
 The residents of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> had been invaded by hostile violence: at the head of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robbers, a hero had extorted ransom and absolution from the vicar of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and the sacred college; and the maxim of the <NORP>French</NORP> warriors, to spare the people and plunder the church, was a new heresy of the most dangerous import.
 (60) While the pope was driven from Avignon, he was strenuously invited to Rome.
 The senate and people acknowledged him as their lawful sovereign, and laid at his feet the keys of the gates, the bridges, and the fortresses; of the <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> at least beyond the Tyber.
 (61) But this loyal offer was accompanied by a declaration, that they could no longer suffer the scandal and calamity of his absence; and that his obstinacy would finally provoke them to revive and assert the primitive right of election.
 The abbot of Mount Cassin had been consulted, whether he would accept the triple crown (62) from the clergy and people: "I am a citizen of Rome," (63) replied that venerable ecclesiastic, "and my <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> law is, the voice of my country.
" (64) His death, A.
D.
 1378, March 27.
 If superstition will interpret an untimely death, (65) if the merit of counsels be judged from the event, the heavens may seem to frown on a measure of such apparent season and propriety.
 <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <DATE>Eleventh</DATE> did not survive above fourteen months his return to the Vatican; and his decease was followed by the great schism of the West, which distracted the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church above <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> years.
 The sacred college was then composed of <CARDINAL>twenty-two</CARDINAL> cardinals: <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> of these had remained at Avignon; <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> Frenchmen, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> Spaniard, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> Italians, entered the conclave in the usual form.
 Election of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> VI.
 (April 9.
) Their choice was not yet limited to the purple; and their unanimous votes acquiesced in the archbishop of Bari, a subject of Naples, conspicuous for his zeal and learning, who ascended the throne of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> under the name of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the Sixth.
 The epistle of the sacred college affirms his free, and regular, election; which had been inspired, as usual, by the Holy Ghost; he was adored, invested, and crowned, with the customary rites; his temporal authority was obeyed at <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Avignon, and his ecclesiastical supremacy was acknowledged in the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world.
 During several weeks, the cardinals attended their new master with the fairest professions of attachment and loyalty; till the summer heats permitted a decent escape from the city.
 But as soon as they were united at <GPE>Anagni</GPE> and Fundi, in a place of security, they cast aside the mask, accused their own falsehood and hypocrisy, excommunicated the apostate and antichrist of Rome, Election of <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> VII.
 (Sept.
 21.
) and proceeded to a new election of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> of Geneva, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Seventh, whom they announced to the nations as the true and rightful vicar of Christ.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> choice, an involuntary and illegal act, was annulled by fear of death and the menaces of the Romans; and their complaint is justified by the strong evidence of probability and fact.
 The <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <NORP>French</NORP> cardinals, above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thirds of the votes, were masters of the election; and whatever might be their provincial jealousies, it cannot fairly be presumed that they would have sacrificed their right and interest to a foreign candidate, who would never restore them to their native country.
 In the various, and often inconsistent, narratives, (66) the shades of popular violence are more darkly or faintly colored: but the licentiousness of the seditious <NORP>Romans</NORP> was inflamed by a sense of their privileges, and the danger of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> emigration.
 The conclave was intimidated by the shouts, and encompassed by the arms, of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> rebels; the bells of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> and St.
 Peter's rang an alarm: "Death, or an <NORP>Italian</NORP> pope!" was the universal cry; the same threat was repeated by the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> bannerets or chiefs of the quarters, in the form of charitable advice; some preparations were made for burning the obstinate cardinals; and had they chosen a <NORP>Transalpine</NORP> subject, it is probable that they would never have departed alive from the Vatican.
 The same constraint imposed the necessity of dissembling in the eyes of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of the world; the pride and cruelty of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> presented a more inevitable danger; and they soon discovered the features of the tyrant, who could walk in his garden and recite his breviary, while he heard from an adjacent chamber <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> cardinals groaning on the rack.
 His inflexible zeal, which loudly censured their luxury and vice, would have attached them to the stations and duties of their parishes at Rome; and had he not fatally delayed a new promotion, the <NORP>French</NORP> cardinals would have been reduced to a helpless minority in the sacred college.
 For these reasons, and the hope of repassing the Alps, they rashly violated the peace and unity of the church; and the merits of their double choice are yet agitated in the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> schools.
 (67) The vanity, rather than the interest, of the nation determined the court and clergy of France.
 (68) The states of Savoy, Sicily, Cyprus, Arragon, Castille, Navarre, and <GPE>Scotland</GPE> were inclined by their example and authority to the obedience of <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Seventh, and after his decease, of <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> the Thirteenth.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the principal states of Italy, Germany, Portugal, England, (69) the Low Countries, and the kingdoms of the North, adhered to the prior election of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the Sixth, who was succeeded by Boniface the Ninth, Innocent the Seventh, and <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Twelfth.
 Great schism of the West, A.
D.
 1378-1418.
 From the banks of the <PRODUCT>Tyber</PRODUCT> and the Rhone, the hostile pontiffs encountered each other with the pen and the sword: the civil and ecclesiastical order of society was disturbed; and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had their full share of the mischiefs of which they may be arraigned as the primary authors.
 (70) They had vainly flattered themselves with the hope of restoring the seat of the ecclesiastical monarchy, and of relieving their poverty with the tributes and offerings of the nations; <NORP>Calamities</NORP> of Rome.
 but the separation of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> diverted the stream of lucrative devotion; nor could the loss be compensated by the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> jubilees which were crowded into the space of ten years.
 By the avocations of the schism, by foreign arms, and popular tumults, <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Sixth</ORDINAL> and his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> successors were often compelled to interrupt their residence in the Vatican.
 The <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> still exercised their deadly feuds: the bannerets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> asserted and abused the privileges of a republic: the vicars of Christ, who had levied a military force, chastised their rebellion with the gibbet, the sword, and the dagger; and, in a friendly conference, <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> deputies of the people were perfidiously murdered and cast into the street.
 Since the invasion of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> the Norman, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had pursued their domestic quarrels without the dangerous interposition of a stranger.
 But in the disorders of the schism, an aspiring neighbour, <PERSON>Ladislaus</PERSON> king of Naples, alternately supported and betrayed the pope and the people; by the former he was declared gonfalonier, or general, of the church, while the latter submitted to his choice the nomination of their magistrates.
 Besieging <GPE>Rome</GPE> by land and water, he thrice entered the gates as a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> conqueror; profaned the altars, violated the virgins, pillaged the merchants, performed his devotions at St.
 Peter's, and left a garrison in the castle of St.
 Angelo.
 His arms were sometimes unfortunate, and to a delay of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days he was indebted for his life and crown: but <PERSON>Ladislaus</PERSON> triumphed in his turn; and it was only his premature death that could save the metropolis and the ecclesiastical state from the ambitious conqueror, who had assumed the title, or at least the powers, of king of Rome.
 (71) Negotiations for peace and union, A.
D.
 1392-1407.
 I have not undertaken the ecclesiastical history of the schism; but Rome, the object of these last chapters, is deeply interested in the disputed succession of her sovereigns.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> counsels for the peace and union of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> arose from the university of Paris, from the faculty of the Sorbonne, whose doctors were esteemed, at least in the <NORP>Gallican</NORP> church, as the most consummate masters of theological science.
 (72) Prudently waiving all invidious inquiry into the origin and merits of the dispute, they proposed, as a healing measure, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> pretenders of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Avignon</GPE> should abdicate at the same time, after qualifying the cardinals of the adverse factions to join in a legitimate election; and that the nations should subtract (73) their obedience, if either of the competitor preferred his own interest to that of the public.
 At each vacancy, these physicians of the church deprecated the mischiefs of a hasty choice; but the policy of the conclave and the ambition of its members were deaf to reason and entreaties; and whatsoever promises were made, the pope could never be bound by the oaths of the cardinal.
 During fifteen years, the pacific designs of the university were eluded by the arts of the rival pontiffs, the scruples or passions of their adherents, and the vicissitudes of <NORP>French</NORP> factions, that ruled the insanity of Charles the Sixth.
 At length a vigorous resolution was embraced; and a solemn embassy, of the titular patriarch of Alexandria, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> archbishops, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> bishops, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> abbots, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> knights, and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> doctors, was sent to the courts of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> and Rome, to require, in the name of the church and king, the abdication of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> pretenders, of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> de Luna, who styled himself <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> the Thirteenth, and of Angelo Corrario, who assumed the name of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Twelfth.
 For the ancient honour of Rome, and the success of their commission, the ambassadors solicited a conference with the magistrates of the city, whom they gratified by a positive declaration, that the most <NORP>Christian</NORP> king did not entertain a wish of transporting the holy see from the Vatican, which he considered as the genuine and proper seat of the successor of St.
 Peter.
 In the name of the senate and people, an eloquent <NORP>Roman</NORP> asserted their desire to cooperate in the union of the church, deplored the temporal and spiritual calamities of the long schism, and requested the protection of <GPE>France</GPE> against the arms of the king of Naples.
 The answers of <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> were alike edifying and alike deceitful; and, in evading the demand of their abdication, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rivals were animated by a common spirit.
 They agreed on the necessity of a previous interview; but the time, the place, and the manner, could never be ascertained by mutual consent.
 "If the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> advances," says a servant of Gregory, "the other retreats; the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> appears an animal fearful of the land, the other a creature apprehensive of the water.
 And thus, for a short remnant of life and power, will these aged priests endanger the peace and salvation of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world.
" (74) Council of Pisa, A.
D.
 1409.
 The <NORP>Christian</NORP> world was at length provoked by their obstinacy and fraud: they were deserted by their cardinals, who embraced each other as friends and colleagues; and their revolt was supported by a numerous assembly of prelates and ambassadors.
 With equal justice, the council of <GPE>Pisa</GPE> deposed the popes of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Avignon; the conclave was unanimous in the choice of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Fifth, and his vacant seat was soon filled by a similar election of <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Twenty-third, the most profligate of mankind.
 But instead of extinguishing the schism, the rashness of the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Italians</NORP> had given a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> pretender to the chair of St.
 Peter.
 Such new claims of the synod and conclave were disputed; <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> kings, of Germany, Hungary, and Naples, adhered to the cause of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Twelfth; and <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> the Thirteenth, himself a Spaniard, was acknowledged by the devotion and patriotism of that powerful nation.
 Council of Constance, (A.
D.
 1414-1418.
) The rash proceedings of <GPE>Pisa</GPE> were corrected by the council of Constance; the emperor <PERSON>Sigismond</PERSON> acted a conspicuous part as the advocate or protector of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church; and the number and weight of civil and ecclesiastical members might seem to constitute the states-general of Europe.
 Of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> popes, <PERSON>John</PERSON> the <DATE>Twenty-third</DATE> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> victim: he fled and was brought back a prisoner: the most scandalous charges were suppressed; the vicar of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was only accused of piracy, murder, rape, sodomy, and incest; and after subscribing his own condemnation, he expiated in prison the imprudence of trusting his person to a free city beyond the Alps.
 <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Twelfth, whose obedience was reduced to the narrow precincts of Rimini, descended with more honour from the throne; and his ambassador convened the session, in which he renounced the title and authority of lawful pope.
 To vanquish the obstinacy of <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> the <DATE>Thirteenth</DATE> or his adherents, the emperor in person undertook a journey from <PERSON>Constance</PERSON> to Perpignan.
 The kings of Castile, Arragon, Navarre, and Scotland, obtained an equal and honourable treaty; with the concurrence of the Spaniards, <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> was deposed by the council; but the harmless old man was left in a solitary castle to excommunicate twice each day the rebel kingdoms which had deserted his cause.
 After thus eradicating the remains of the schism, the synod of <PERSON>Constance</PERSON> proceeded with slow and cautious steps to elect the sovereign of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the head of the church.
 On this momentous occasion, the college of <CARDINAL>twenty-three</CARDINAL> cardinals was fortified with <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> deputies; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> of whom were chosen in each of the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> great nations of Christendom, — the Italian, the German, the French, the Spanish, and the English: (75) the interference of strangers was softened by their generous preference of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> and a Roman; Election of <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> V.
 and the hereditary, as well as personal, merit of Otho <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> recommended him to the conclave.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> accepted with joy and obedience the noblest of her sons; the ecclesiastical statewas defended by his powerful family; and the elevation of <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> is the aera of the restoration and establishment of the popes in the Vatican.

 The royal prerogative of coining money, which had been exercised near <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years by the senate, was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> resumed by <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> the Fifth, (77) and his image and superscription introduce the series of the papal medals.
 Of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> immediate successors, <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> IV.

 (79) The last revolt of Rome, (A.
D.
 1434, May 29-October 26.
) I.
 The conflict of <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> with the fathers of Basil, and the weight or apprehension of a new excise, emboldened and provoked the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to usurp the temporal government of the city.
 They rose in arms, elected <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> governors of the republic, and a constable of the Capitol; imprisoned the pope's nephew; besieged his person in the palace; and shot volleys of arrows into his bark as he escaped down the <PRODUCT>Tyber</PRODUCT> in the habit of a monk.
 But he still possessed in the castle of St.
 Angelo a faithful garrison and a train of artillery: their batteries incessantly thundered on the city, and a bullet more dexterously pointed broke down the barricade of the bridge, and scattered with a single shot the heroes of the republic.
 Their constancy was exhausted by a rebellion of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months.
 Under the tyranny of the <NORP>Ghibeline</NORP> nobles, the wisest patriots regretted the dominion of the church; and their repentance was unanimous and effectual.
 The troops of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> again occupied the Capitol; the magistrates departed to their homes; the most guilty were executed or exiled; and the legate, at the head of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse, was saluted as the father of the city.
 The synods of <GPE>Ferrara</GPE> and Florence, the fear or resentment of Eugenius, prolonged his absence: he was received by a submissive people; but the pontiff understood from the acclamations of his triumphal entry, that to secure their loyalty and his own repose, he must grant without delay the abolition of the odious excise.
 The last coronation of a <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, Frederic III.
 (A.
D.
 1452, March 18.
) II.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was restored, adorned, and enlightened, by the peaceful reign of <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the Fifth.
 In the midst of these laudable occupations, the pope was alarmed by the approach of Frederic the Third of Austria; though his fears could not be justified by the character or the power of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> candidate.
 After drawing his military force to the metropolis, and imposing the best security of oaths (80) and treaties, <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> received with a smiling countenance the faithful advocate and vassal of the church.
 So tame were the times, so feeble was the Austrian, that the pomp of his coronation was accomplished with order and harmony: but the superfluous honour was so disgraceful to an independent nation, that his successors have excused themselves from the toilsome pilgrimage to the Vatican; and rest their <ORG>Imperial</ORG> title on the choice of the electors of Germany.
 The statutes and government of Rome.
 A citizen has remarked, with pride and pleasure, that the king of the Romans, after passing with a slight salute the cardinals and prelates who met him at the gate, distinguished the dress and person of the senator of Rome; and in this last farewell, the pageants of the empire and the republic were clasped in a friendly embrace.
 (81) According to the laws of Rome, (82) her <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate was required to be a doctor of laws, an alien, of a place at least <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> miles from the city; with whose inhabitants he must not be connected in the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> canonical degree of blood or alliance.
 The election was annual: a severe scrutiny was instituted into the conduct of the departing senator; nor could he be recalled to the same office till after the expiration of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years.
 A liberal salary of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> florins was assigned for his expense and reward; and his public appearance represented the majesty of the republic.
 His robes were of gold brocade or crimson velvet, or in the summer season of a lighter silk: he bore in his hand an ivory sceptre; the sound of trumpets announced his approach; and his solemn steps were preceded at least by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> lictors or attendants, whose red wands were enveloped with bands or streamers of the golden colour or livery of the city.
 His oath in the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> proclaims his right and duty to observe and assert the laws, to control the proud, to protect the poor, and to exercise justice and mercy within the extent of his jurisdiction.
 In these useful functions he was assisted by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> learned strangers; the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> collaterals, and the judge of criminal appeals: their frequent trials of robberies, rapes, and murders, are attested by the laws; and the weakness of these laws connives at the licentiousness of private feuds and armed associations for mutual defence.
 But the senator was confined to the administration of justice: the Capitol, the treasury, and the government of the city and its territory, were entrusted to the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> conservators, who were changed <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> times in each year: the militia of the <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> regions assembled under the banners of their respective chiefs, or caporioni; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these was distinguished by the name and dignity of the prior.
 The popular legislature consisted of the secret and the common councils of the Romans.
 The former was composed of the magistrates and their immediate predecessors, with some fiscal and legal officers, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> classes of thirteen, twenty-six, and forty, counsellors: amounting in the whole to about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> persons.
 In the common council all male citizens had a right to vote; and the value of their privilege was enhanced by the care with which any foreigners were prevented from usurping the title and character of Romans.
 The tumult of a democracy was checked by wise and jealous precautions: except the magistrates, none could propose a question; none were permitted to speak, except from an open pulpit or tribunal; all disorderly acclamations were suppressed; the sense of the majority was decided by a secret ballot; and their decrees were promulgated in the venerable name of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate and people.
 It would not be easy to assign a period in which this theory of government has been reduced to accurate and constant practice, since the establishment of order has been gradually connected with the decay of liberty.
 But in the year <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty the ancient statutes were collected, methodized in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> books, and adapted to present use, under the pontificate, and with the approbation, of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Thirteenth: (83) this civil and criminal code is the modern law of the city; and, if the popular assemblies have been abolished, a foreign senator, with the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> conservators, still resides in the palace of the Capitol.
 (84) The policy of the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> has been repeated by the popes; and the bishop of <GPE>Rome</GPE> affected to maintain the form of a republic, while he reigned with the absolute powers of a temporal, as well as a spiritual, monarch.
 Conspiracy of Porcaro, A.
D.
 1453, January 9.
 It is an obvious truth, that the times must be suited to extraordinary characters, and that the genius of <PERSON>Cromwell</PERSON> or <PERSON>Retz</PERSON> might now expire in obscurity.
 The political enthusiasm of <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> had exalted him to a throne; the same enthusiasm, in the next century, conducted his imitator to the gallows.
 The birth of <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> <PERSON>Porcaro</PERSON> was noble, his reputation spotless: his tongue was armed with eloquence, his mind was enlightened with learning; and he aspired, beyond the aim of vulgar ambition, to free his country and immortalize his name.
 The dominion of priests is most odious to a liberal spirit: every scruple was removed by the recent knowledge of the fable and forgery of Constantine's donation; <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> was now the oracle of the Italians; and as often as <PERSON>Porcaro</PERSON> revolved the ode which describes the patriot and hero of Rome, he applied to himself the visions of the prophetic bard.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> trial of the popular feelings was at the funeral of <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> the Fourth: in an elaborate speech he called the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to liberty and arms; and they listened with apparent pleasure, till <PERSON>Porcaro</PERSON> was interrupted and answered by a grave advocate, who pleaded for the church and state.
 By every law the seditious orator was guilty of treason; but the benevolence of the new pontiff, who viewed his character with pity and esteem, attempted by an honourable office to convert the patriot into a friend.
 The inflexible <NORP>Roman</NORP> returned from <GPE>Anagni</GPE> with an increase of reputation and zeal; and, on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> opportunity, the games of the place Navona, he tried to inflame the casual dispute of some boys and mechanics into a general rising of the people.
 Yet the humane <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> was still averse to accept the forfeit of his life; and the traitor was removed from the scene of temptation to Bologna, with a liberal allowance for his support, and the easy obligation of presenting himself each day before the governor of the city.
 But <PERSON>Porcaro</PERSON> had learned from the younger Brutus, that with tyrants no faith or gratitude should be observed: the exile declaimed against the arbitrary sentence; a party and a conspiracy were gradually formed: his nephew, a daring youth, assembled a band of volunteers; and on the appointed evening a feast was prepared at his house for the friends of the republic.
 Their leader, who had escaped from Bologna, appeared among them in a robe of purple and gold: his voice, his countenance, his gestures, bespoke the man who had devoted his life or death to the glorious cause.
 In a studied oration, he expiated on the motives and the means of their enterprise; the name and liberties of Rome; the sloth and pride of their ecclesiastical tyrants; the active or passive consent of their fellow-citizens; <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> exiles, long exercised in arms or in wrongs; the license of revenge to edge their swords, and a million of ducats to reward their victory.
 It would be easy, (he said,) on the next day, the festival of the Epiphany, to seize the pope and his cardinals, before the doors, or at the altar, of St.
 Peter's; to lead them in chains under the walls of St.
 Angelo; to extort by the threat of their instant death a surrender of the castle; to ascend the vacant Capitol; to ring the alarm bell; and to restore in a popular assembly the ancient republic of Rome.
 While he triumphed, he was already betrayed.
 The senator, with a strong guard, invested the house: the nephew of <PERSON>Porcaro</PERSON> cut his way through the crowd; but the unfortunate <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> was drawn from a chest, lamenting that his enemies had anticipated by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hours the execution of his design.
 After such manifest and repeated guilt, even the mercy of <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> was silent.
 Porcaro, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> of his accomplices, were hanged without the benefit of the sacraments; and, amidst the fears and invectives of the papal court, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> pitied, and almost applauded, these martyrs of their country.
 (85) But their applause was mute, their pity ineffectual, their liberty forever extinct; and, if they have since risen in a vacancy of the throne or a scarcity of bread, such accidental tumults may be found in the bosom of the most abject servitude.
 Last disorders of the nobles of Rome.
 But the independence of the nobles, which was fomented by discord, survived the freedom of the commons, which must be founded in union.
 A privilege of rapine and oppression was long maintained by the barons of Rome; their houses were a fortress and a sanctuary: and the ferocious train of banditti and criminals whom they protected from the law repaid the hospitality with the service of their swords and daggers.
 The private interest of the pontiffs, or their nephews, sometimes involved them in these domestic feuds.
 Under the reign of Sixtus the Fourth, <GPE>Rome</GPE> was distracted by the battles and sieges of the rival houses: after the conflagration of his palace, the prothonotary <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> was tortured and beheaded; and Savelli, his captive friend, was murdered on the spot, for refusing to join in the acclamations of the victorious Ursini.
 (86) But the popes no longer trembled in the Vatican: they had strength to command, if they had resolution to claim, the obedience of their subjects; and the strangers, who observed these partial disorders, admired the easy taxes and wise administration of the ecclesiastical state.
 (87) The popes acquire absolute dominion of Rome, A.
D.
 1500 etc.
 The spiritual thunders of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> depend on the force of opinion; and if that opinion be supplanted by reason or passion, the sound may idly waste itself in the air; and the helpless priest is exposed to the brutal violence of a noble or a plebeian adversary.
 But after their return from Avignon, the keys of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> were guarded by the sword of St.
 Paul.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was commanded by an impregnable citadel: the use of cannon is a powerful engine against popular seditions: a regular force of cavalry and infantry was enlisted under the banners of the pope: his ample revenues supplied the resources of war: and, from the extent of his domain, he could bring down on a rebellious city an army of hostile neighbours and loyal subjects.
 (88) Since the union of the duchies of <GPE>Ferrara</GPE> and Urbino, the ecclesiastical state extends from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Adriatic, and from the confines of <GPE>Naples</GPE> to the banks of the Po; and as early as the sixteenth century, the greater part of that spacious and fruitful country acknowledged the lawful claims and temporal sovereignty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiffs.
 Their claims were readily deduced from the genuine, or fabulous, donations of the darker ages: the successive steps of their final settlement would engage us too far in the transactions of Italy, and even of Europe; the crimes of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Sixth, the martial operations of <PERSON>Julius</PERSON> the Second, and the liberal policy of Leo the Tenth, a theme which has been adorned by the pens of the noblest historians of the times.
 (89) In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> period of their conquests, till the expedition of Charles the Eighth, the popes might successfully wrestle with the adjacent princes and states, whose military force was equal, or inferior, to their own.
 But as soon as the monarchs of France, <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Spain, contended with gigantic arms for the dominion of Italy, they supplied with art the deficiency of strength; and concealed, in a labyrinth of wars and treaties, their aspiring views, and the immortal hope of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 The nice balance of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> was often subverted by the soldiers of the <LOC>North</LOC> and West, who were united under the standard of Charles the Fifth: the feeble and fluctuating policy of <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> exposed his person and dominions to the conqueror; and <GPE>Rome</GPE> was abandoned <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months to a lawless army, more cruel and rapacious than the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Vandals.
 (90) After this severe lesson, the popes contracted their ambition, which was almost satisfied, resumed the character of a common parent, and abstained from all offensive hostilities, except in a hasty quarrel, when the vicar of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan were armed at the same time against the kingdom of Naples.
 (91) The <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Germans</NORP> at length withdrew from the field of battle: Milan, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, and the sea-coast of Tuscany, were firmly possessed by the Spaniards; and it became their interest to maintain the peace and dependence of Italy, which continued almost without disturbance from the middle of the sixteenth to the opening of the eighteenth century.
 The <FAC>Vatican</FAC> was swayed and protected by the religious policy of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> king: his prejudice and interest disposed him in every dispute to support the prince against the people; and instead of the encouragement, the aid, and the asylum, which they obtained from the adjacent states, the friends of liberty, or the enemies of law, were enclosed on all sides within the iron circle of despotism.
 The long habits of obedience and education subdued the turbulent spirit of the nobles and commons of Rome.
 The barons forgot the arms and factions of their ancestors, and insensibly became the servants of luxury and government.
 Instead of maintaining a crowd of tenants and followers, the produce of their estates was consumed in the private expenses which multiply the pleasures, and diminish the power, of the lord.
 (92) The <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> vied with each other in the decoration of their palaces and chapels; and their antique splendour was rivalled or surpassed by the sudden opulence of the papal families.
 In <GPE>Rome</GPE> the voice of freedom and discord is no longer heard; and, instead of the foaming torrent, a smooth and stagnant lake reflects the image of idleness and servitude.
 The ecclesiastical government.
 A Christian, a philosopher, (93) and a patriot, will be equally scandalized by the temporal kingdom of the clergy; and the local majesty of Rome, the remembrance of her consuls and triumphs, may seem to embitter the sense, and aggravate the shame, of her slavery.
 If we calmly weigh the merits and defects of the ecclesiastical government, it may be praised in its present state, as a mild, decent, and tranquil system, exempt from the dangers of a minority, the sallies of youth, the expenses of luxury, and the calamities of war.
 But these advantages are overbalanced by a frequent, perhaps a septennial, election of a sovereign, who is seldom a native of the country; the reign of a young statesman of threescore, in the decline of his life and abilities, without hope to accomplish, and without children to inherit, the labours of his transitory reign.
 The successful candidate is drawn from the church, and even the convent; from the mode of education and life the most adverse to reason, humanity, and freedom.
 In the trammels of servile faith, he has learned to believe because it is absurd, to revere all that is contemptible, and to despise whatever might deserve the esteem of a rational being; to punish error as a crime, to reward mortification and celibacy as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of virtues; to place the saints of the calendar (94) above the heroes of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the sages of Athens; and to consider the missal, or the crucifix, as more useful instruments than the plough or the loom.
 In the office of nuncio, or the rank of cardinal, he may acquire some knowledge of the world, but the primitive stain will adhere to his mind and manners: from study and experience he may suspect the mystery of his profession; but the sacerdotal artist will imbibe some portion of the bigotry which he inculcates.
 Sixtus V.
 (A.
D.
 1585-1590.
) The genius of Sixtus the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> (95) burst from the gloom of a <NORP>Franciscan</NORP> cloister.
 In a reign of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, he exterminated the outlaws and banditti, abolished the profane sanctuaries of Rome, (96) formed a naval and military force, restored and emulated the monuments of antiquity, and after a liberal use and large increase of the revenue, left <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> millions of crowns in the castle of St.
 Angelo.
 But his justice was sullied with cruelty, his activity was prompted by the ambition of conquest: after his decease the abuses revived; the treasure was dissipated; he entailed on posterity <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> new taxes and the venality of offices; and, after his death, his statue was demolished by an ungrateful, or an injured, people.
 (97) The wild and original character of Sixtus the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> stands alone in the series of the pontiffs; the maxims and effects of their temporal government may be collected from the positive and comparative view of the arts and philosophy, the agriculture and trade, the wealth and population, of the ecclesiastical state.
 For myself, it is my wish to depart in charity with all mankind, nor am I willing, in these last moments, to offend even the pope and clergy of Rome.
 (98) « NEXT » « Fall In The <LOC>East</LOC> » « Fall In The <LOC>West</LOC> » « Comments on the Fall » « Decline and Fall » As long as the yoke of <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was that of justice and their country, their conscience forced them to esteem the man, whom pride and interest provoked them to hate: his extravagant conduct soon fortified their hatred by contempt; and they conceived the hope of subverting a power which was no longer so deeply rooted in the public confidence.
 The old animosity of the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> was suspended for a moment by their common disgrace: they associated their wishes, and perhaps their designs; an assassin was seized and tortured; he accused the nobles; and as soon as <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> deserved the fate, he adopted the suspicions and maxims, of a tyrant.
 On the same day, under various pretences, he invited to the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> his principal enemies, among whom were <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> members of the <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> of the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> name.
 But instead of a council or a banquet, they found themselves prisoners under the sword of despotism or justice; and the consciousness of innocence or guilt might inspire them with equal apprehensions of danger.
 At the sound of the great bell the people assembled; they were arraigned for a conspiracy against the tribune's life; and though some might sympathize in their distress, not a hand, nor a voice, was raised to rescue the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the nobility from their impending doom.
 Their apparent boldness was prompted by despair; they passed in separate chambers a sleepless and painful night; and the venerable hero, <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> Colonna, striking against the door of his prison, repeatedly urged his guards to deliver him by a speedy death from such ignominious servitude.
 In the morning they understood their sentence from the visit of a confessor and the tolling of the bell.
 The great hall of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> had been decorated for the bloody scene with red and white hangings: the countenance of the tribune was dark and severe; the swords of the executioners were unsheathed; and the barons were interrupted in their dying speeches by the sound of trumpets.
 But in this decisive moment, <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was not less anxious or apprehensive than his captives: he dreaded the splendour of their names, their surviving kinsmen, the inconstancy of the people the reproaches of the world, and, after rashly offering a mortal injury, he vainly presumed that, if he could forgive, he might himself be forgiven.
 His elaborate oration was that of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> and a suppliant; and, as the humble minister of the commons, he entreated his masters to pardon these noble criminals, for whose repentance and future service he pledged his faith and authority.
 Astonished by this marvellous clemency, the barons bowed their heads; and while they devoutly repeated the oath of allegiance, might whisper a secret, and more sincere, assurance of revenge.
 A priest, in the name of the people, pronounced their absolution: they received the communion with the tribune, assisted at the banquet, followed the procession; and, after every spiritual and temporal sign of reconciliation, were dismissed in safety to their respective homes, with the new honours and titles of generals, consuls, and patricians.
 (42) They oppose <PERSON>Reinzi</PERSON> in arms.
 During some weeks they were checked by the memory of their danger, rather than of their deliverance, till the most powerful of the Ursini, escaping with the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> from the city, erected at <PERSON>Marino</PERSON> the standard of rebellion.
 The fortifications of the castle were instantly restored; the vassals attended their lord; the outlaws armed against the magistrate; the flocks and herds, the harvests and vineyards, from <PERSON>Marino</PERSON> to the gates of Rome, were swept away or destroyed; and the people arraigned <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> as the author of the calamities which his government had taught them to forget.
 In the camp, <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> appeared to less advantage than in the rostrum; and he neglected the progress of the rebel barons till their numbers were strong, and their castles impregnable.
 From the pages of <WORK_OF_ART>Livy</WORK_OF_ART> he had not imbibed the art, or even the courage, of a general: an army of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Romans</NORP> returned without honour or effect from the attack of Marino; and his vengeance was amused by painting his enemies, their heads downwards, and drowning <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> dogs (at least they should have been bears) as the representatives of the Ursini.
 The belief of his incapacity encouraged their operations: they were invited by their secret adherents; and the barons attempted, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot, and sixteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horse, to enter <GPE>Rome</GPE> by force or surprise.
 The city was prepared for their reception; the alarm-bell rung all night; the gates were strictly guarded, or insolently open; and after some hesitation they sounded a retreat.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> divisions had passed along the walls, but the prospect of a free entrance tempted the headstrong valour of the nobles in the rear; and after a successful skirmish, they were overthrown and massacred without <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> by the crowds of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Defeat and death of the Colonna,(Nov.
 20.
) <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> the younger, the noble spirit to whom <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> ascribed the restoration of Italy, was preceded or accompanied in death by his son John, a gallant youth, by his brother Peter, who might regret the ease and honours of the church, by a nephew of legitimate birth, and by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bastards of the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> race; and the number of seven, the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> crowns, as <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> styled them, of the Holy Ghost, was completed by the agony of the deplorable parent, and the veteran chief, who had survived the hope and fortune of his house.
 The vision and prophecies of St.
 <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> and Pope Boniface had been used by the tribune to animate his troops: (43) he displayed, at least in the pursuit, the spirit of a hero; but he forgot the maxims of the ancient Romans, who abhorred the triumphs of civil war.
 The conqueror ascended the Capitol; deposited his crown and sceptre on the altar; and boasted, with some truth, that he had cut off an ear, which neither pope nor emperor had been able to amputate.
 (44) His base and implacable revenge denied the honours of burial; and the bodies of the Colonna, which he threatened to expose with those of the vilest malefactors, were secretly interred by the holy virgins of their name and family.
 (45) The people sympathized in their grief, repented of their own fury, and detested the indecent joy of Rienzi, who visited the spot where these illustrious victims had fallen.
 It was on that fatal spot that he conferred on his son the honour of knighthood: and the ceremony was accomplished by a slight blow from each of the horsemen of the guard, and by a ridiculous and inhuman ablution from a pool of water, which was yet polluted with patrician blood.
 (46) Fall and flight of the tribune Rienzi, A.
D.
 1347, Dec.
 15.
 A short delay would have saved the Colonna, the delay of a single month, which elapsed between the triumph and the exile of Rienzi.
 In the pride of victory, he forfeited what yet remained of his civil virtues, without acquiring the fame of military prowess.
 A free and vigorous opposition was formed in the city; and when the tribune proposed in the public council (47) to impose a new tax, and to regulate the government of Perugia, <CARDINAL>thirty-nine</CARDINAL> members voted against his measures; repelled the injurious charge of treachery and corruption; and urged him to prove, by their forcible exclusion, that if the populace adhered to his cause, it was already disclaimed by the most respectable citizens.
 The pope and the sacred college had never been dazzled by his specious professions; they were justly offended by the insolence of his conduct; a cardinal legate was sent to Italy, and after some fruitless treaty, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> personal interviews, he fulminated a bull of excommunication, in which the tribune is degraded from his office, and branded with the guilt of rebellion, sacrilege, and heresy.
 (48) The surviving barons of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were now humbled to a sense of allegiance; their interest and revenge engaged them in the service of the church; but as the fate of the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> was before their eyes, they abandoned to a private adventurer the peril and glory of the revolution.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> Pepin, count of Minorbino, (49) in the kingdom of Naples, had been condemned for his crimes, or his riches, to perpetual imprisonment; and Petrarch, by soliciting his release, indirectly contributed to the ruin of his friend.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> soldiers, the count of <PERSON>Minorbino</PERSON> introduced himself into Rome; barricaded the <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the Colonna: and found the enterprise as easy as it had seemed impossible.
 From the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> alarm, the bell of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> incessantly tolled; but, instead of repairing to the well-known sound, the people were silent and inactive; and the pusillanimous Rienzi, deploring their ingratitude with sighs and tears, abdicated the government and palace of the republic.
 Revolutions of Rome, A.
D.
 1347-1354.
 Without drawing his sword, count <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> restored the aristocracy and the church; <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> senators were chosen, and the legate, assuming the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rank, accepted his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> colleagues from the rival families of <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> and Ursini.
 The acts of the tribune were abolished, his head was proscribed; yet such was the terror of his name, that the barons hesitated <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days before they would trust themselves in the city, and <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was left above a month in the castle of St.
 Angelo, from whence he peaceably withdrew, after laboring, without effect, to revive the affection and courage of the Romans.
 The vision of freedom and empire had vanished: their fallen spirit would have acquiesced in servitude, had it been smoothed by tranquillity and order; and it was scarcely observed, that the new senators derived their authority from the Apostolic See; that <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> cardinals were appointed to reform, with dictatorial power, the state of the republic.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was again agitated by the bloody feuds of the barons, who detested each other, and despised the commons: their hostile fortresses, both in town and country, again rose, and were again demolished: and the peaceful citizens, a flock of sheep, were devoured, says the <NORP>Florentine</NORP> historian, by these rapacious wolves.
 But when their pride and avarice had exhausted the patience of the Romans, a confraternity of the Virgin Mary protected or avenged the republic: the bell of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> was again tolled, the nobles in arms trembled in the presence of an unarmed multitude; and of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> senators, <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> escaped from the window of the palace, and <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> was stoned at the foot of the altar.
 The dangerous office of tribune was successively occupied by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> plebeians, <PERSON>Cerroni</PERSON> and Baroncelli.
 The mildness of <PERSON>Cerroni</PERSON> was unequal to the times; and after a faint struggle, he retired with a fair reputation and a decent fortune to the comforts of rural life.
 Devoid of eloquence or genius, <PERSON>Baroncelli</PERSON> was distinguished by a resolute spirit: he spoke the language of a patriot, and trod in the footsteps of tyrants; his suspicion was a sentence of death, and his own death was the reward of his cruelties.
 Amidst the public misfortunes, the faults of <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> were forgotten; and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> sighed for the peace and prosperity of their good estate.
 (50) Adventures of Rienzi.
 After an exile of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> deliverer was again restored to his country.
 In the disguise of a monk or a pilgrim, he escaped from the castle of St.
 Angelo, implored the friendship of the king of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> at Naples, tempted the ambition of every bold adventurer, mingled at <GPE>Rome</GPE> with the pilgrims of the jubilee, lay concealed among the hermits of the Apennine, and wandered through the cities of Italy, Germany, and Bohemia.
 His person was invisible, his name was yet formidable; and the anxiety of the court of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> supposes, and even magnifies, his personal merit.
 The emperor Charles the <ORDINAL>Fourth</ORDINAL> gave audience to a stranger, who frankly revealed himself as the tribune of the republic; and astonished an assembly of ambassadors and princes, by the eloquence of a patriot and the visions of a prophet, the downfall of tyranny and the kingdom of the Holy Ghost.
 (51) Whatever had been his hopes, <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> found himself a captive; but he supported a character of independence and dignity, and obeyed, as his own choice, the irresistible summons of the supreme pontiff.
 The zeal of Petrarch, which had been cooled by the unworthy conduct, was rekindled by the sufferings and the presence, of his friend; and he boldly complains of the times, in which the saviour of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was delivered by her emperor into the hands of her bishop.
 A prisoner at Avignon, (A.
D.
 1351.
) <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was transported slowly, but in safe custody, from <GPE>Prague</GPE> to Avignon: his entrance into the city was that of a malefactor; in his prison he was chained by the leg; and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> cardinals were named to inquire into the crimes of heresy and rebellion.
 But his trial and condemnation would have involved some questions, which it was more prudent to leave under the veil of mystery: the temporal supremacy of the popes; the duty of residence; the civil and ecclesiastical privileges of the clergy and people of Rome.
 The reigning pontiff well deserved the appellation of Clement: the strange vicissitudes and magnanimous spirit of the captive excited his pity and esteem; and <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> believes that he respected in the hero the name and sacred character of a poet.
 (52) <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was indulged with an easy confinement and the use of books; and in the assiduous study of <WORK_OF_ART>Livy</WORK_OF_ART> and the Bible, he sought the cause and the consolation of his misfortunes.
 Rienzi, senator of Rome, A.
D.
 1354.
 The succeeding pontificate of Innocent the <ORDINAL>Sixth</ORDINAL> opened a new prospect of his deliverance and restoration; and the court of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> was persuaded, that the successful rebel could alone appease and reform the anarchy of the metropolis.
 After a solemn profession of fidelity, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tribune was sent into Italy, with the title of senator; but the death of <PERSON>Baroncelli</PERSON> appeared to supersede the use of his mission; and the legate, Cardinal Albornoz, (53) a consummate statesman, allowed him with reluctance, and without aid, to undertake the perilous experiment.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> reception was equal to his wishes: the day of his entrance was a public festival; and his eloquence and authority revived the laws of the good estate.
 But this momentary sunshine was soon clouded by his own vices and those of the people: in the Capitol, he might often regret the prison of Avignon; and after a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> administration of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> months, <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> was massacred in a tumult which had been fomented by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> barons.
 In the society of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> and Bohemians, he is said to have contracted the habits of intemperance and cruelty: adversity had chilled his enthusiasm, without fortifying his reason or virtue; and that youthful hope, that lively assurance, which is the pledge of success, was now succeeded by the cold impotence of distrust and despair.
 The tribune had reigned with absolute dominion, by the choice, and in the hearts, of the Romans: the senator was the servile minister of a foreign court; and while he was suspected by the people, he was abandoned by the prince.
 The legate Albornoz, who seemed desirous of his ruin, inflexibly refused all supplies of men and money; a faithful subject could no longer presume to touch the revenues of the apostolical chamber; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> idea of a tax was the signal of clamour and sedition.
 Even his justice was tainted with the guilt or reproach of selfish cruelty: the most virtuous citizen of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was sacrificed to his jealousy; and in the execution of a public robber, from whose purse he had been assisted, the magistrate too much forgot, or too much remembered, the obligations of the debtor.
 (54) A civil war exhausted his treasures, and the patience of the city: the <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> maintained their hostile station at Palestrina; and his mercenaries soon despised a leader whose ignorance and fear were envious of all subordinate merit.
 In the death, as in the life, of Rienzi, the hero and the coward were strangely mingled.
 When the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> was invested by a furious multitude, when he was basely deserted by his civil and military servants, the intrepid senator, waving the banner of liberty, presented himself on the balcony, addressed his eloquence to the various passions of the Romans, and labored to persuade them, that in the same cause himself and the republic must either stand or fall.
 His oration was interrupted by a volley of imprecations and stones; and after an arrow had transpierced his hand, he sunk into abject despair, and fled weeping to the inner chambers, from whence he was let down by a sheet before the windows of the prison.
 Destitute of aid or hope, he was besieged till the evening: the doors of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> were destroyed with axes and fire; and while the senator attempted to escape in a plebeian habit, he was discovered and dragged to the platform of the palace, the fatal scene of his judgments and executions.
 His death, (A.
D.
 1354, September 8.
) A whole hour, without voice or motion, he stood amidst the multitude <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> naked and <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> dead: their rage was hushed into curiosity and wonder: the last feelings of reverence and compassion yet struggled in his favour; and they might have prevailed, if a bold assassin had not plunged a dagger in his breast.
 He fell senseless with the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> stroke: the impotent revenge of his enemies inflicted a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> wounds: and the senator's body was abandoned to the dogs, to the Jews, and to the flames.
 Posterity will compare the virtues and failings of this extraordinary man; but in a long period of anarchy and servitude, the name of <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> has often been celebrated as the deliverer of his country, and the last of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> patriots.
 (55) <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> invites and upbraids the emperor Charles IV.
 A.
D.
 1355, January-May.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most generous wish of <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> was the restoration of a free republic; but after the exile and death of his plebeian hero, he turned his eyes from the tribune, to the king, of the Romans.
 The <FAC>Capitol</FAC> was yet stained with the blood of Rienzi, when Charles the <ORDINAL>Fourth</ORDINAL> descended from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to obtain the <NORP>Italian</NORP> and <ORG>Imperial</ORG> crowns.
 In his passage through <GPE>Milan</GPE> he received the visit, and repaid the flattery, of the poet-laureate; accepted a medal of Augustus; and promised, without a smile, to imitate the founder of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarchy.
 A false application of the name and maxims of antiquity was the source of the hopes and disappointments of Petrarch; yet he could not overlook the difference of times and characters; the immeasurable distance between the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> and a <NORP>Bohemian</NORP> prince, who by the favour of the clergy had been elected the titular head of the <NORP>German</NORP> aristocracy.
 Instead of restoring to <GPE>Rome</GPE> her glory and her provinces, he had bound himself by a secret treaty with the pope, to evacuate the city on the day of his coronation; and his shameful retreat was pursued by the reproaches of the patriot bard.
 (56) He solicits the popes of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> to fix their residence at Rome.
 After the loss of liberty and empire, his <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> and more humble wish was to reconcile the shepherd with his flock; to recall the <NORP>Roman</NORP> bishop to his ancient and peculiar diocese.
 In the fervour of youth, with the authority of age, <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> addressed his exhortations to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> successive popes, and his eloquence was always inspired by the enthusiasm of sentiment and the freedom of language.
 (57) The son of a citizen of <GPE>Florence</GPE> invariably preferred the country of his birth to that of his education; and Italy, in his eyes, was the queen and garden of the world.
 Amidst her domestic factions, she was doubtless superior to <GPE>France</GPE> both in art and science, in wealth and politeness; but the difference could scarcely support the epithet of barbarous, which he promiscuously bestows on the countries beyond the Alps.
 Avignon, the mystic Babylon, the sink of vice and corruption, was the object of his hatred and contempt; but he forgets that her scandalous vices were not the growth of the soil, and that in every residence they would adhere to the power and luxury of the papal court.
 He confesses that the successor of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> is the bishop of the universal church; yet it was not on the banks of the Rhone, but of the Tyber, that the apostle had fixed his everlasting throne; and while every city in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world was blessed with a bishop, the metropolis alone was desolate and forlorn.
 Since the removal of the Holy See, the sacred buildings of the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> and the Vatican, their altars and their saints, were left in a state of poverty and decay; and <GPE>Rome</GPE> was often painted under the image of a disconsolate matron, as if the wandering husband could be reclaimed by the homely portrait of the age and infirmities of his weeping spouse.
 (58) But the cloud which hung over the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hills would be dispelled by the presence of their lawful sovereign: eternal fame, the prosperity of Rome, and the peace of Italy, would be the recompense of the pope who should dare to embrace this generous resolution.
 Of the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> whom <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> exhorted, the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> first, <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Twenty-second, <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> the Twelfth, and <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Sixth, were importuned or amused by the boldness of the orator; but the memorable change which had been attempted by <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> was finally accomplished by <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Eleventh.
 The execution of their design was opposed by weighty and almost insuperable obstacles.
 A king of France, who has deserved the epithet of wise, was unwilling to release them from a local dependence: the cardinals, for the most part his subjects, were attached to the language, manners, and climate of Avignon; to their stately palaces; above all, to the wines of Burgundy.
 In their eyes, <GPE>Italy</GPE> was foreign or hostile; and they reluctantly embarked at Marseilles, as if they had been sold or banished into the land of the Saracens.
 Return of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> V.
 (A.
D.
 1367, October 16-1370, April 17.
) <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> resided <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years in the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> with safety and honour: his sanctity was protected by a guard of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse; and the king of Cyprus, the queen of Naples, and the emperors of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, devoutly saluted their common father in the chair of St.
 Peter.
 But the joy of <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> and the <NORP>Italians</NORP> was soon turned into grief and indignation.
 Some reasons of public or private moment, his own impatience or the prayers of the cardinals, recalled <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> to France; and the approaching election was saved from the tyrannic patriotism of the Romans.
 The powers of heaven were interested in their cause: <PERSON>Bridget</PERSON> of Sweden, a saint and pilgrim, disapproved the return, and foretold the death, of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the Fifth: Final return of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> XI.
 (A.
D.
 1377, January 17.
) the migration of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <DATE>Eleventh</DATE> was encouraged by St.
 Catherine of Sienna, the spouse of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and ambassadress of the Florentines; and the popes themselves, the great masters of human credulity, appear to have listened to these visionary females.
 (59) Yet those celestial admonitions were supported by some arguments of temporal policy.
 The residents of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> had been invaded by hostile violence: at the head of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> robbers, a hero had extorted ransom and absolution from the vicar of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and the sacred college; and the maxim of the <NORP>French</NORP> warriors, to spare the people and plunder the church, was a new heresy of the most dangerous import.
 (60) While the pope was driven from Avignon, he was strenuously invited to Rome.
 The senate and people acknowledged him as their lawful sovereign, and laid at his feet the keys of the gates, the bridges, and the fortresses; of the <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> at least beyond the Tyber.
 (61) But this loyal offer was accompanied by a declaration, that they could no longer suffer the scandal and calamity of his absence; and that his obstinacy would finally provoke them to revive and assert the primitive right of election.
 The abbot of Mount Cassin had been consulted, whether he would accept the triple crown (62) from the clergy and people: His death, A.
D.
 1378, March 27.
 If superstition will interpret an untimely death, (65) if the merit of counsels be judged from the event, the heavens may seem to frown on a measure of such apparent season and propriety.
 <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <DATE>Eleventh</DATE> did not survive above fourteen months his return to the Vatican; and his decease was followed by the great schism of the West, which distracted the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church above <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> years.
 The sacred college was then composed of <CARDINAL>twenty-two</CARDINAL> cardinals: <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> of these had remained at Avignon; <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> Frenchmen, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> Spaniard, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> Italians, entered the conclave in the usual form.
 Election of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> VI.
 (April 9.
) Their choice was not yet limited to the purple; and their unanimous votes acquiesced in the archbishop of Bari, a subject of Naples, conspicuous for his zeal and learning, who ascended the throne of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> under the name of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the Sixth.
 The epistle of the sacred college affirms his free, and regular, election; which had been inspired, as usual, by the Holy Ghost; he was adored, invested, and crowned, with the customary rites; his temporal authority was obeyed at <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Avignon, and his ecclesiastical supremacy was acknowledged in the <NORP>Latin</NORP> world.
 During several weeks, the cardinals attended their new master with the fairest professions of attachment and loyalty; till the summer heats permitted a decent escape from the city.
 But as soon as they were united at <GPE>Anagni</GPE> and Fundi, in a place of security, they cast aside the mask, accused their own falsehood and hypocrisy, excommunicated the apostate and antichrist of Rome, Election of <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> VII.
 (Sept.
 21.
) and proceeded to a new election of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> of Geneva, <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Seventh, whom they announced to the nations as the true and rightful vicar of Christ.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> choice, an involuntary and illegal act, was annulled by fear of death and the menaces of the Romans; and their complaint is justified by the strong evidence of probability and fact.
 The <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <NORP>French</NORP> cardinals, above <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thirds of the votes, were masters of the election; and whatever might be their provincial jealousies, it cannot fairly be presumed that they would have sacrificed their right and interest to a foreign candidate, who would never restore them to their native country.
 In the various, and often inconsistent, narratives, (66) the shades of popular violence are more darkly or faintly colored: but the licentiousness of the seditious <NORP>Romans</NORP> was inflamed by a sense of their privileges, and the danger of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> emigration.
 The conclave was intimidated by the shouts, and encompassed by the arms, of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> rebels; the bells of the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> and St.
 Peter's rang an alarm: "Death, or an <NORP>Italian</NORP> pope!" was the universal cry; the same threat was repeated by the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> bannerets or chiefs of the quarters, in the form of charitable advice; some preparations were made for burning the obstinate cardinals; and had they chosen a <NORP>Transalpine</NORP> subject, it is probable that they would never have departed alive from the Vatican.
 The same constraint imposed the necessity of dissembling in the eyes of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of the world; the pride and cruelty of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> presented a more inevitable danger; and they soon discovered the features of the tyrant, who could walk in his garden and recite his breviary, while he heard from an adjacent chamber <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> cardinals groaning on the rack.
 His inflexible zeal, which loudly censured their luxury and vice, would have attached them to the stations and duties of their parishes at Rome; and had he not fatally delayed a new promotion, the <NORP>French</NORP> cardinals would have been reduced to a helpless minority in the sacred college.
 For these reasons, and the hope of repassing the Alps, they rashly violated the peace and unity of the church; and the merits of their double choice are yet agitated in the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> schools.
 (67) The vanity, rather than the interest, of the nation determined the court and clergy of France.
 (68) The states of Savoy, Sicily, Cyprus, Arragon, Castille, Navarre, and <GPE>Scotland</GPE> were inclined by their example and authority to the obedience of <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the Seventh, and after his decease, of <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> the Thirteenth.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the principal states of Italy, Germany, Portugal, England, (69) the Low Countries, and the kingdoms of the North, adhered to the prior election of <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the Sixth, who was succeeded by Boniface the Ninth, Innocent the Seventh, and <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Twelfth.
 Great schism of the West, A.
D.
 1378-1418.
 From the banks of the <PRODUCT>Tyber</PRODUCT> and the Rhone, the hostile pontiffs encountered each other with the pen and the sword: the civil and ecclesiastical order of society was disturbed; and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had their full share of the mischiefs of which they may be arraigned as the primary authors.
 (70) They had vainly flattered themselves with the hope of restoring the seat of the ecclesiastical monarchy, and of relieving their poverty with the tributes and offerings of the nations; <NORP>Calamities</NORP> of Rome.
 but the separation of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> diverted the stream of lucrative devotion; nor could the loss be compensated by the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> jubilees which were crowded into the space of ten years.
 By the avocations of the schism, by foreign arms, and popular tumults, <PERSON>Urban</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Sixth</ORDINAL> and his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> successors were often compelled to interrupt their residence in the Vatican.
 The <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> still exercised their deadly feuds: the bannerets of <GPE>Rome</GPE> asserted and abused the privileges of a republic: the vicars of Christ, who had levied a military force, chastised their rebellion with the gibbet, the sword, and the dagger; and, in a friendly conference, <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> deputies of the people were perfidiously murdered and cast into the street.
 Since the invasion of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> the Norman, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had pursued their domestic quarrels without the dangerous interposition of a stranger.
 But in the disorders of the schism, an aspiring neighbour, <PERSON>Ladislaus</PERSON> king of Naples, alternately supported and betrayed the pope and the people; by the former he was declared gonfalonier, or general, of the church, while the latter submitted to his choice the nomination of their magistrates.
 Besieging <GPE>Rome</GPE> by land and water, he thrice entered the gates as a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> conqueror; profaned the altars, violated the virgins, pillaged the merchants, performed his devotions at St.
 Peter's, and left a garrison in the castle of St.
 Angelo.
 His arms were sometimes unfortunate, and to a delay of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days he was indebted for his life and crown: but <PERSON>Ladislaus</PERSON> triumphed in his turn; and it was only his premature death that could save the metropolis and the ecclesiastical state from the ambitious conqueror, who had assumed the title, or at least the powers, of king of Rome.
 (71) Negotiations for peace and union, A.
D.
 1392-1407.
 I have not undertaken the ecclesiastical history of the schism; but Rome, the object of these last chapters, is deeply interested in the disputed succession of her sovereigns.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> counsels for the peace and union of <NORP>Christendom</NORP> arose from the university of Paris, from the faculty of the Sorbonne, whose doctors were esteemed, at least in the <NORP>Gallican</NORP> church, as the most consummate masters of theological science.
 (72) Prudently waiving all invidious inquiry into the origin and merits of the dispute, they proposed, as a healing measure, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> pretenders of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Avignon</GPE> should abdicate at the same time, after qualifying the cardinals of the adverse factions to join in a legitimate election; and that the nations should subtract (73) their obedience, if either of the competitor preferred his own interest to that of the public.
 At each vacancy, these physicians of the church deprecated the mischiefs of a hasty choice; but the policy of the conclave and the ambition of its members were deaf to reason and entreaties; and whatsoever promises were made, the pope could never be bound by the oaths of the cardinal.
 During fifteen years, the pacific designs of the university were eluded by the arts of the rival pontiffs, the scruples or passions of their adherents, and the vicissitudes of <NORP>French</NORP> factions, that ruled the insanity of Charles the Sixth.
 At length a vigorous resolution was embraced; and a solemn embassy, of the titular patriarch of Alexandria, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> archbishops, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> bishops, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> abbots, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> knights, and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> doctors, was sent to the courts of <GPE>Avignon</GPE> and Rome, to require, in the name of the church and king, the abdication of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> pretenders, of <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> de Luna, who styled himself <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> the Thirteenth, and of Angelo Corrario, who assumed the name of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Twelfth.
 For the ancient honour of Rome, and the success of their commission, the ambassadors solicited a conference with the magistrates of the city, whom they gratified by a positive declaration, that the most <NORP>Christian</NORP> king did not entertain a wish of transporting the holy see from the Vatican, which he considered as the genuine and proper seat of the successor of St.
 Peter.
 In the name of the senate and people, an eloquent <NORP>Roman</NORP> asserted their desire to cooperate in the union of the church, deplored the temporal and spiritual calamities of the long schism, and requested the protection of <GPE>France</GPE> against the arms of the king of Naples.
 The answers of <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> were alike edifying and alike deceitful; and, in evading the demand of their abdication, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rivals were animated by a common spirit.
 They agreed on the necessity of a previous interview; but the time, the place, and the manner, could never be ascertained by mutual consent.
 Council of Pisa, A.
D.
 1409.
 The <NORP>Christian</NORP> world was at length provoked by their obstinacy and fraud: they were deserted by their cardinals, who embraced each other as friends and colleagues; and their revolt was supported by a numerous assembly of prelates and ambassadors.
 With equal justice, the council of <GPE>Pisa</GPE> deposed the popes of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Avignon; the conclave was unanimous in the choice of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Fifth, and his vacant seat was soon filled by a similar election of <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Twenty-third, the most profligate of mankind.
 But instead of extinguishing the schism, the rashness of the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Italians</NORP> had given a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> pretender to the chair of St.
 Peter.
 Such new claims of the synod and conclave were disputed; <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> kings, of Germany, Hungary, and Naples, adhered to the cause of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Twelfth; and <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> the Thirteenth, himself a Spaniard, was acknowledged by the devotion and patriotism of that powerful nation.
 Council of Constance, (A.
D.
 1414-1418.
) The rash proceedings of <GPE>Pisa</GPE> were corrected by the council of Constance; the emperor <PERSON>Sigismond</PERSON> acted a conspicuous part as the advocate or protector of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church; and the number and weight of civil and ecclesiastical members might seem to constitute the states-general of Europe.
 Of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> popes, <PERSON>John</PERSON> the <DATE>Twenty-third</DATE> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> victim: he fled and was brought back a prisoner: the most scandalous charges were suppressed; the vicar of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was only accused of piracy, murder, rape, sodomy, and incest; and after subscribing his own condemnation, he expiated in prison the imprudence of trusting his person to a free city beyond the Alps.
 <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Twelfth, whose obedience was reduced to the narrow precincts of Rimini, descended with more honour from the throne; and his ambassador convened the session, in which he renounced the title and authority of lawful pope.
 To vanquish the obstinacy of <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> the <DATE>Thirteenth</DATE> or his adherents, the emperor in person undertook a journey from <PERSON>Constance</PERSON> to Perpignan.
 The kings of Castile, Arragon, Navarre, and Scotland, obtained an equal and honourable treaty; with the concurrence of the Spaniards, <PERSON>Benedict</PERSON> was deposed by the council; but the harmless old man was left in a solitary castle to excommunicate twice each day the rebel kingdoms which had deserted his cause.
 After thus eradicating the remains of the schism, the synod of <PERSON>Constance</PERSON> proceeded with slow and cautious steps to elect the sovereign of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the head of the church.
 On this momentous occasion, the college of <CARDINAL>twenty-three</CARDINAL> cardinals was fortified with <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> deputies; <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> of whom were chosen in each of the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> great nations of Christendom, — the Italian, the German, the French, the Spanish, and the English: (75) the interference of strangers was softened by their generous preference of an <NORP>Italian</NORP> and a Roman; Election of <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> V.
 and the hereditary, as well as personal, merit of Otho <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> recommended him to the conclave.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> accepted with joy and obedience the noblest of her sons; the ecclesiastical statewas defended by his powerful family; and the elevation of <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> is the aera of the restoration and establishment of the popes in the Vatican.

 The royal prerogative of coining money, which had been exercised near <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years by the senate, was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> resumed by <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> the Fifth, (77) and his image and superscription introduce the series of the papal medals.

) and <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the Fifth, the last who was importuned by the presence of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 (79) The last revolt of Rome, (A.
D.
 1434, May 29-October 26.
) I.
 The conflict of <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> with the fathers of Basil, and the weight or apprehension of a new excise, emboldened and provoked the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to usurp the temporal government of the city.
 They rose in arms, elected <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> governors of the republic, and a constable of the Capitol; imprisoned the pope's nephew; besieged his person in the palace; and shot volleys of arrows into his bark as he escaped down the <PRODUCT>Tyber</PRODUCT> in the habit of a monk.
 But he still possessed in the castle of St.
 Angelo a faithful garrison and a train of artillery: their batteries incessantly thundered on the city, and a bullet more dexterously pointed broke down the barricade of the bridge, and scattered with a single shot the heroes of the republic.
 Their constancy was exhausted by a rebellion of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months.
 Under the tyranny of the <NORP>Ghibeline</NORP> nobles, the wisest patriots regretted the dominion of the church; and their repentance was unanimous and effectual.
 The troops of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> again occupied the Capitol; the magistrates departed to their homes; the most guilty were executed or exiled; and the legate, at the head of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse, was saluted as the father of the city.
 The synods of <GPE>Ferrara</GPE> and Florence, the fear or resentment of Eugenius, prolonged his absence: he was received by a submissive people; but the pontiff understood from the acclamations of his triumphal entry, that to secure their loyalty and his own repose, he must grant without delay the abolition of the odious excise.
 The last coronation of a <NORP>German</NORP> emperor, Frederic III.
 (A.
D.
 1452, March 18.
) II.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was restored, adorned, and enlightened, by the peaceful reign of <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the Fifth.
 In the midst of these laudable occupations, the pope was alarmed by the approach of Frederic the Third of Austria; though his fears could not be justified by the character or the power of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> candidate.
 After drawing his military force to the metropolis, and imposing the best security of oaths (80) and treaties, <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> received with a smiling countenance the faithful advocate and vassal of the church.
 So tame were the times, so feeble was the Austrian, that the pomp of his coronation was accomplished with order and harmony: but the superfluous honour was so disgraceful to an independent nation, that his successors have excused themselves from the toilsome pilgrimage to the Vatican; and rest their <ORG>Imperial</ORG> title on the choice of the electors of Germany.
 The statutes and government of Rome.
 A citizen has remarked, with pride and pleasure, that the king of the Romans, after passing with a slight salute the cardinals and prelates who met him at the gate, distinguished the dress and person of the senator of Rome; and in this last farewell, the pageants of the empire and the republic were clasped in a friendly embrace.
 (81) According to the laws of Rome, (82) her <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate was required to be a doctor of laws, an alien, of a place at least <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> miles from the city; with whose inhabitants he must not be connected in the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> canonical degree of blood or alliance.
 The election was annual: a severe scrutiny was instituted into the conduct of the departing senator; nor could he be recalled to the same office till after the expiration of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years.
 A liberal salary of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> florins was assigned for his expense and reward; and his public appearance represented the majesty of the republic.
 His robes were of gold brocade or crimson velvet, or in the summer season of a lighter silk: he bore in his hand an ivory sceptre; the sound of trumpets announced his approach; and his solemn steps were preceded at least by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> lictors or attendants, whose red wands were enveloped with bands or streamers of the golden colour or livery of the city.
 His oath in the <FAC>Capitol</FAC> proclaims his right and duty to observe and assert the laws, to control the proud, to protect the poor, and to exercise justice and mercy within the extent of his jurisdiction.
 In these useful functions he was assisted by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> learned strangers; the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> collaterals, and the judge of criminal appeals: their frequent trials of robberies, rapes, and murders, are attested by the laws; and the weakness of these laws connives at the licentiousness of private feuds and armed associations for mutual defence.
 But the senator was confined to the administration of justice: the Capitol, the treasury, and the government of the city and its territory, were entrusted to the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> conservators, who were changed <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> times in each year: the militia of the <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> regions assembled under the banners of their respective chiefs, or caporioni; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these was distinguished by the name and dignity of the prior.
 The popular legislature consisted of the secret and the common councils of the Romans.
 The former was composed of the magistrates and their immediate predecessors, with some fiscal and legal officers, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> classes of thirteen, twenty-six, and forty, counsellors: amounting in the whole to about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> persons.
 In the common council all male citizens had a right to vote; and the value of their privilege was enhanced by the care with which any foreigners were prevented from usurping the title and character of Romans.
 The tumult of a democracy was checked by wise and jealous precautions: except the magistrates, none could propose a question; none were permitted to speak, except from an open pulpit or tribunal; all disorderly acclamations were suppressed; the sense of the majority was decided by a secret ballot; and their decrees were promulgated in the venerable name of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate and people.
 It would not be easy to assign a period in which this theory of government has been reduced to accurate and constant practice, since the establishment of order has been gradually connected with the decay of liberty.
 But in the year <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and eighty the ancient statutes were collected, methodized in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> books, and adapted to present use, under the pontificate, and with the approbation, of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Thirteenth: (83) this civil and criminal code is the modern law of the city; and, if the popular assemblies have been abolished, a foreign senator, with the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> conservators, still resides in the palace of the Capitol.
 (84) The policy of the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> has been repeated by the popes; and the bishop of <GPE>Rome</GPE> affected to maintain the form of a republic, while he reigned with the absolute powers of a temporal, as well as a spiritual, monarch.
 Conspiracy of Porcaro, A.
D.
 1453, January 9.
 It is an obvious truth, that the times must be suited to extraordinary characters, and that the genius of <PERSON>Cromwell</PERSON> or <PERSON>Retz</PERSON> might now expire in obscurity.
 The political enthusiasm of <PERSON>Rienzi</PERSON> had exalted him to a throne; the same enthusiasm, in the next century, conducted his imitator to the gallows.
 The birth of <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> <PERSON>Porcaro</PERSON> was noble, his reputation spotless: his tongue was armed with eloquence, his mind was enlightened with learning; and he aspired, beyond the aim of vulgar ambition, to free his country and immortalize his name.
 The dominion of priests is most odious to a liberal spirit: every scruple was removed by the recent knowledge of the fable and forgery of Constantine's donation; <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> was now the oracle of the Italians; and as often as <PERSON>Porcaro</PERSON> revolved the ode which describes the patriot and hero of Rome, he applied to himself the visions of the prophetic bard.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> trial of the popular feelings was at the funeral of <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> the Fourth: in an elaborate speech he called the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to liberty and arms; and they listened with apparent pleasure, till <PERSON>Porcaro</PERSON> was interrupted and answered by a grave advocate, who pleaded for the church and state.
 By every law the seditious orator was guilty of treason; but the benevolence of the new pontiff, who viewed his character with pity and esteem, attempted by an honourable office to convert the patriot into a friend.
 The inflexible <NORP>Roman</NORP> returned from <GPE>Anagni</GPE> with an increase of reputation and zeal; and, on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> opportunity, the games of the place Navona, he tried to inflame the casual dispute of some boys and mechanics into a general rising of the people.
 Yet the humane <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> was still averse to accept the forfeit of his life; and the traitor was removed from the scene of temptation to Bologna, with a liberal allowance for his support, and the easy obligation of presenting himself each day before the governor of the city.
 But <PERSON>Porcaro</PERSON> had learned from the younger Brutus, that with tyrants no faith or gratitude should be observed: the exile declaimed against the arbitrary sentence; a party and a conspiracy were gradually formed: his nephew, a daring youth, assembled a band of volunteers; and on the appointed evening a feast was prepared at his house for the friends of the republic.
 Their leader, who had escaped from Bologna, appeared among them in a robe of purple and gold: his voice, his countenance, his gestures, bespoke the man who had devoted his life or death to the glorious cause.
 In a studied oration, he expiated on the motives and the means of their enterprise; the name and liberties of Rome; the sloth and pride of their ecclesiastical tyrants; the active or passive consent of their fellow-citizens; <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> soldiers, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> exiles, long exercised in arms or in wrongs; the license of revenge to edge their swords, and a million of ducats to reward their victory.
 It would be easy, (he said,) on the next day, the festival of the Epiphany, to seize the pope and his cardinals, before the doors, or at the altar, of St.
 Peter's; to lead them in chains under the walls of St.
 Angelo; to extort by the threat of their instant death a surrender of the castle; to ascend the vacant Capitol; to ring the alarm bell; and to restore in a popular assembly the ancient republic of Rome.
 While he triumphed, he was already betrayed.
 The senator, with a strong guard, invested the house: the nephew of <PERSON>Porcaro</PERSON> cut his way through the crowd; but the unfortunate <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> was drawn from a chest, lamenting that his enemies had anticipated by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hours the execution of his design.
 After such manifest and repeated guilt, even the mercy of <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> was silent.
 Porcaro, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> of his accomplices, were hanged without the benefit of the sacraments; and, amidst the fears and invectives of the papal court, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> pitied, and almost applauded, these martyrs of their country.
 (85) But their applause was mute, their pity ineffectual, their liberty forever extinct; and, if they have since risen in a vacancy of the throne or a scarcity of bread, such accidental tumults may be found in the bosom of the most abject servitude.
 Last disorders of the nobles of Rome.
 But the independence of the nobles, which was fomented by discord, survived the freedom of the commons, which must be founded in union.
 A privilege of rapine and oppression was long maintained by the barons of Rome; their houses were a fortress and a sanctuary: and the ferocious train of banditti and criminals whom they protected from the law repaid the hospitality with the service of their swords and daggers.
 The private interest of the pontiffs, or their nephews, sometimes involved them in these domestic feuds.
 Under the reign of Sixtus the Fourth, <GPE>Rome</GPE> was distracted by the battles and sieges of the rival houses: after the conflagration of his palace, the prothonotary <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> was tortured and beheaded; and Savelli, his captive friend, was murdered on the spot, for refusing to join in the acclamations of the victorious Ursini.
 (86) But the popes no longer trembled in the Vatican: they had strength to command, if they had resolution to claim, the obedience of their subjects; and the strangers, who observed these partial disorders, admired the easy taxes and wise administration of the ecclesiastical state.
 (87) The popes acquire absolute dominion of Rome, A.
D.
 1500 etc.
 The spiritual thunders of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> depend on the force of opinion; and if that opinion be supplanted by reason or passion, the sound may idly waste itself in the air; and the helpless priest is exposed to the brutal violence of a noble or a plebeian adversary.
 But after their return from Avignon, the keys of St.
 <PERSON>Peter</PERSON> were guarded by the sword of St.
 Paul.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was commanded by an impregnable citadel: the use of cannon is a powerful engine against popular seditions: a regular force of cavalry and infantry was enlisted under the banners of the pope: his ample revenues supplied the resources of war: and, from the extent of his domain, he could bring down on a rebellious city an army of hostile neighbours and loyal subjects.
 (88) Since the union of the duchies of <GPE>Ferrara</GPE> and Urbino, the ecclesiastical state extends from the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> to the Adriatic, and from the confines of <GPE>Naples</GPE> to the banks of the Po; and as early as the sixteenth century, the greater part of that spacious and fruitful country acknowledged the lawful claims and temporal sovereignty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiffs.
 Their claims were readily deduced from the genuine, or fabulous, donations of the darker ages: the successive steps of their final settlement would engage us too far in the transactions of Italy, and even of Europe; the crimes of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Sixth, the martial operations of <PERSON>Julius</PERSON> the Second, and the liberal policy of Leo the Tenth, a theme which has been adorned by the pens of the noblest historians of the times.
 (89) In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> period of their conquests, till the expedition of Charles the Eighth, the popes might successfully wrestle with the adjacent princes and states, whose military force was equal, or inferior, to their own.
 But as soon as the monarchs of France, <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Spain, contended with gigantic arms for the dominion of Italy, they supplied with art the deficiency of strength; and concealed, in a labyrinth of wars and treaties, their aspiring views, and the immortal hope of chasing the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> beyond the Alps.
 The nice balance of the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> was often subverted by the soldiers of the <LOC>North</LOC> and West, who were united under the standard of Charles the Fifth: the feeble and fluctuating policy of <PERSON>Clement</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Seventh</ORDINAL> exposed his person and dominions to the conqueror; and <GPE>Rome</GPE> was abandoned <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months to a lawless army, more cruel and rapacious than the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Vandals.
 (90) After this severe lesson, the popes contracted their ambition, which was almost satisfied, resumed the character of a common parent, and abstained from all offensive hostilities, except in a hasty quarrel, when the vicar of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan were armed at the same time against the kingdom of Naples.
 (91) The <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Germans</NORP> at length withdrew from the field of battle: Milan, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, and the sea-coast of Tuscany, were firmly possessed by the Spaniards; and it became their interest to maintain the peace and dependence of Italy, which continued almost without disturbance from the middle of the sixteenth to the opening of the eighteenth century.
 The <FAC>Vatican</FAC> was swayed and protected by the religious policy of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> king: his prejudice and interest disposed him in every dispute to support the prince against the people; and instead of the encouragement, the aid, and the asylum, which they obtained from the adjacent states, the friends of liberty, or the enemies of law, were enclosed on all sides within the iron circle of despotism.
 The long habits of obedience and education subdued the turbulent spirit of the nobles and commons of Rome.
 The barons forgot the arms and factions of their ancestors, and insensibly became the servants of luxury and government.
 Instead of maintaining a crowd of tenants and followers, the produce of their estates was consumed in the private expenses which multiply the pleasures, and diminish the power, of the lord.
 (92) The <PERSON>Colonna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> vied with each other in the decoration of their palaces and chapels; and their antique splendour was rivalled or surpassed by the sudden opulence of the papal families.
 In <GPE>Rome</GPE> the voice of freedom and discord is no longer heard; and, instead of the foaming torrent, a smooth and stagnant lake reflects the image of idleness and servitude.
 The ecclesiastical government.
 A Christian, a philosopher, (93) and a patriot, will be equally scandalized by the temporal kingdom of the clergy; and the local majesty of Rome, the remembrance of her consuls and triumphs, may seem to embitter the sense, and aggravate the shame, of her slavery.
 If we calmly weigh the merits and defects of the ecclesiastical government, it may be praised in its present state, as a mild, decent, and tranquil system, exempt from the dangers of a minority, the sallies of youth, the expenses of luxury, and the calamities of war.
 But these advantages are overbalanced by a frequent, perhaps a septennial, election of a sovereign, who is seldom a native of the country; the reign of a young statesman of threescore, in the decline of his life and abilities, without hope to accomplish, and without children to inherit, the labours of his transitory reign.
 The successful candidate is drawn from the church, and even the convent; from the mode of education and life the most adverse to reason, humanity, and freedom.
 In the trammels of servile faith, he has learned to believe because it is absurd, to revere all that is contemptible, and to despise whatever might deserve the esteem of a rational being; to punish error as a crime, to reward mortification and celibacy as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of virtues; to place the saints of the calendar (94) above the heroes of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the sages of Athens; and to consider the missal, or the crucifix, as more useful instruments than the plough or the loom.
 In the office of nuncio, or the rank of cardinal, he may acquire some knowledge of the world, but the primitive stain will adhere to his mind and manners: from study and experience he may suspect the mystery of his profession; but the sacerdotal artist will imbibe some portion of the bigotry which he inculcates.
 Sixtus V.
 (A.
D.
 1585-1590.
) The genius of Sixtus the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> (95) burst from the gloom of a <NORP>Franciscan</NORP> cloister.
 In a reign of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, he exterminated the outlaws and banditti, abolished the profane sanctuaries of Rome, (96) formed a naval and military force, restored and emulated the monuments of antiquity, and after a liberal use and large increase of the revenue, left <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> millions of crowns in the castle of St.
 Angelo.
 But his justice was sullied with cruelty, his activity was prompted by the ambition of conquest: after his decease the abuses revived; the treasure was dissipated; he entailed on posterity <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> new taxes and the venality of offices; and, after his death, his statue was demolished by an ungrateful, or an injured, people.
 (97) The wild and original character of Sixtus the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> stands alone in the series of the pontiffs; the maxims and effects of their temporal government may be collected from the positive and comparative view of the arts and philosophy, the agriculture and trade, the wealth and population, of the ecclesiastical state.
 For myself, it is my wish to depart in charity with all mankind, nor am I willing, in these last moments, to offend even the pope and clergy of Rome.
 (98)
