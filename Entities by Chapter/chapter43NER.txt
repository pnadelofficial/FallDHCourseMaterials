Rebellions of Africa— Restoration of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Kingdom by Totila— Loss and Recovery of Rome— Final Conquest of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by Narses— Extinction of the Ostrogoths— Defeat of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni— Last Victory, Disgrace, and Death of Belisarius.
 Death and Character of Justinian— Comets, Earthquakes, and PlagueThe review of the nations from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the <LOC>Nile</LOC> has exposed, on every side, the weakness of the Romans; and our wonder is reasonably excited that they should presume to enlarge an empire whose ancient limits they were incapable of defending.
 But the wars, the conquests, and the triumphs of Justinian, are the feeble and pernicious efforts of old age, which exhaust the remains of strength, and accelerate the decay of the powers of life.
 He exulted in the glorious act of restoring <LOC>Africa</LOC> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> to the republic; but the calamities which followed the departure of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> betrayed the impotence of the conqueror, and accomplished the ruin of those unfortunate countries.
 The troubles of Africa, A.
D.
 535-545 From his new acquisitions, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> expected that his avarice, as well as pride, should be richly gratified.
 A rapacious minister of the finances closely pursued the footsteps of Belisarius; and as the old registers of tribute had been burnt by the Vandals, he indulged his fancy in a liberal calculation and arbitrary assessment of the wealth of Africa.
 (1) The increase of taxes, which were drawn away by a distant sovereign, and a general resumption of the patrimony or crown lands, soon dispelled the intoxication of the public joy: but the emperor was insensible to the modest complaints of the people, till he was awakened and alarmed by the clamors of military discontent.
 Many of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> soldiers had married the widows and daughters of the Vandals.
 As their own, by the double right of conquest and inheritance, they claimed the estates which <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> had assigned to his victorious troops.
 They heard with disdain the cold and selfish representations of their officers, that the liberality of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> had raised them from a savage or servile condition; that they were already enriched by the spoils of Africa, the treasure, the slaves, and the movables of the vanquished Barbarians; and that the ancient and lawful patrimony of the emperors would be applied only to the support of that government on which their own safety and reward must ultimately depend.
 The mutiny was secretly inflamed by a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers, for the most part Heruli, who had imbibed the doctrines, and were instigated by the clergy, of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> sect; and the cause of perjury and rebellion was sanctified by the dispensing powers of fanaticism.
 The <NORP>Arians</NORP> deplored the ruin of their church, triumphant above a century in Africa; and they were justly provoked by the laws of the conqueror, which interdicted the baptism of their children, and the exercise of all religious worship.
 Of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> chosen by Belisarius, the far greater part, in the honors of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> service, forgot their country and religion.
 But a generous band of four hundred obliged the mariners, when they were in sight of the Isle of Lesbos, to alter their course: they touched on Peloponnesus, ran ashore on a desert coast of Africa, and boldly erected, on Mount Aurasius, the standard of independence and revolt.
 While the troops of the provinces disclaimed the commands of their superiors, a conspiracy was formed at <GPE>Carthage</GPE> against the life of Solomon, who filled with honor the place of Belisarius; and the <NORP>Arians</NORP> had piously resolved to sacrifice the tyrant at the foot of the altar, during the awful mysteries of the festival of Easter.
 Fear or remorse restrained the daggers of the assassins, but the patience of <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON> emboldened their discontent; and, at the end of ten days, a furious sedition was kindled in the Circus, which desolated <LOC>Africa</LOC> above ten years.
 The pillage of the city, and the indiscriminate slaughter of its inhabitants, were suspended only by darkness, sleep, and intoxication: the governor, with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> companions, among whom was the historian Procopius, escaped to Sicily: <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thirds of the army were involved in the guilt of treason; and eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> insurgents, assembling in the field of Bulla, elected <PERSON>Stoza</PERSON> for their chief, a private soldier, who possessed in a superior degree the virtues of a rebel.
 Under the mask of freedom, his eloquence could lead, or at least impel, the passions of his equals.
 He raised himself to a level with Belisarius, and the nephew of the emperor, by daring to encounter them in the field; and the victorious generals were compelled to acknowledge that <PERSON>Stoza</PERSON> deserved a purer cause, and a more legitimate command.
 Vanquished in battle, he dexterously employed the arts of negotiation; a <NORP>Roman</NORP> army was seduced from their allegiance, and the chiefs who had trusted to his faithless promise were murdered by his order in a church of Numidia.
 When every resource, either of force or perfidy, was exhausted, Stoza, with some desperate Vandals, retired to the wilds of Mauritania, obtained the daughter of a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> prince, and eluded the pursuit of his enemies, by the report of his death.
 The personal weight of Belisarius, the rank, the spirit, and the temper, of Germanus, the emperor's nephew, and the vigor and success of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> administration of the eunuch Solomon, restored the modesty of the camp, and maintained for a while the tranquillity of Africa.
 But the vices of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court were felt in that distant province; the troops complained that they were neither paid nor relieved, and as soon as the public disorders were sufficiently mature, <PERSON>Stoza</PERSON> was again alive, in arms, and at the gates of Carthage.
 He fell in a single combat, but he smiled in the agonies of death, when he was informed that his own javelin had reached the heart of his antagonist.
 The example of Stoza, and the assurance that a fortunate soldier had been the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> king, encouraged the ambition of Gontharis, and he promised, by a private treaty, to divide <LOC>Africa</LOC> with the Moors, if, with their dangerous aid, he should ascend the throne of Carthage.
 The feeble Areobindus, unskilled in the affairs of peace and war, was raised, by his marriage with the niece of Justinian, to the office of exarch.
 He was suddenly oppressed by a sedition of the guards, and his abject supplications, which provoked the contempt, could not move the pity, of the inexorable tyrant.
 After a reign of thirty days, <PERSON>Gontharis</PERSON> himself was stabbed at a banquet by the hand of Artaban; and it is singular enough, that an <NORP>Armenian</NORP> prince, of the royal family of Arsaces, should reestablish at <GPE>Carthage</GPE> the authority of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 In the conspiracy which unsheathed the dagger of <PERSON>Brutus</PERSON> against the life of Caesar, every circumstance is curious and important to the eyes of posterity; but the guilt or merit of these loyal or rebellious assassins could interest only the contemporaries of Procopius, who, by their hopes and fears, their friendship or resentment, were personally engaged in the revolutions of Africa.
 (2) Rebellion of the Moors, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>543-558</CARDINAL> That country was rapidly sinking into the state of barbarism from whence it had been raised by the <NORP>Phoenician</NORP> colonies and <NORP>Roman</NORP> laws; and every step of intestine discord was marked by some deplorable victory of savage man over civilized society.
 The Moors, (3) though ignorant of justice, were impatient of oppression: their vagrant life and boundless wilderness disappointed the arms, and eluded the chains, of a conqueror; and experience had shown, that neither oaths nor obligations could secure the fidelity of their attachment.
 The victory of Mount Auras had awed them into momentary submission; but if they respected the character of Solomon, they hated and despised the pride and luxury of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nephews, <PERSON>Cyrus</PERSON> and Sergius, on whom their uncle had imprudently bestowed the provincial governments of <GPE>Tripoli</GPE> and Pentapolis.
 A <NORP>Moorish</NORP> tribe encamped under the walls of Leptis, to renew their alliance, and receive from the governor the customary gifts.
 Fourscore of their deputies were introduced as friends into the city; but on the dark suspicion of a conspiracy, they were massacred at the table of Sergius, and the clamor of arms and revenge was reechoed through the valleys of Mount Atlas from both the <LOC>Syrtes</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean.
 A personal injury, the unjust execution or murder of his brother, rendered <PERSON>Antalas</PERSON> the enemy of the Romans.
 The defeat of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> had formerly signalized his valor; the rudiments of justice and prudence were still more conspicuous in a Moor; and while he laid <PERSON>Adrumetum</PERSON> in ashes, he calmly admonished the emperor that the peace of <LOC>Africa</LOC> might be secured by the recall of <PERSON>Solomon</PERSON> and his unworthy nephews.
 The exarch led forth his troops from Carthage: but, at the distance of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days' journey, in the neighborhood of Tebeste, (4) he was astonished by the superior numbers and fierce aspect of the Barbarians.
 He proposed a treaty; solicited a reconciliation; and offered to bind himself by the most solemn oaths.
 Their honour was vindicated in the field of Tebeste, by the death of Solomon, and the total loss of his army.
 The arrival of fresh troops and more skilful commanders soon checked the insolence of the Moors: <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> of their princes were slain in the same battle; and the doubtful and transient submission of their tribes was celebrated with lavish applause by the people of Constantinople.
 Successive inroads had reduced the province of <LOC>Africa</LOC> to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the measure of Italy; yet the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors continued to reign above a century over <GPE>Carthage</GPE> and the fruitful coast of the Mediterranean.
 But the victories and the losses of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> were alike pernicious to mankind; and such was the desolation of Africa, that in many parts a stranger might wander whole days without meeting the face either of a friend or an enemy.
 The nation of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> had disappeared: they once amounted to a hundred and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors, without including the children, the women, or the slaves.
 Their numbers were infinitely surpassed by the number of the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> families extirpated in a relentless war; and the same destruction was retaliated on the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and their allies, who perished by the climate, their mutual quarrels, and the rage of the Barbarians.
 When <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> landed, he admired the populousness of the cities and country, strenuously exercised in the labors of commerce and agriculture.
 In less than twenty years, that busy scene was converted into a silent solitude; the wealthy citizens escaped to <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Constantinople; and the secret historian has confidently affirmed, that <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> millions of <NORP>Africans</NORP> were consumed by the wars and government of the emperor Justinian.
 (5) Revolt of the Goths, A.
D.
 540.
 The jealousy of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court had not permitted <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> to achieve the conquest of Italy; and his abrupt departure revived the courage of the Goths, (6) who respected his genius, his virtue, and even the laudable motive which had urged the servant of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> to deceive and reject them.
 They had lost their king, (an inconsiderable loss,) their capital, their treasures, the provinces from <GPE>Sicily</GPE> to the Alps, and the military force of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Barbarians, magnificently equipped with horses and arms.
 Yet all was not lost, as long as <GPE>Pavia</GPE> was defended by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Goths, inspired by a sense of honor, the love of freedom, and the memory of their past greatness.
 The supreme command was unanimously offered to the brave Uraias; and it was in his eyes alone that the disgrace of his uncle <PERSON>Vitiges</PERSON> could appear as a reason of exclusion.
 His voice inclined the election in favor of Hildibald, whose personal merit was recommended by the vain hope that his kinsman Theudes, the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> monarch, would support the common interest of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation.
 The success of his arms in <GPE>Liguria</GPE> and <GPE>Venetia</GPE> seemed to justify their choice; but he soon declared to the world that he was incapable of forgiving or commanding his benefactor.
 The consort of <PERSON>Hildibald</PERSON> was deeply wounded by the beauty, the riches, and the pride, of the wife of Uraias; and the death of that virtuous patriot excited the indignation of a free people.
 A bold assassin executed their sentence by striking off the head of <PERSON>Hildibald</PERSON> in the midst of a banquet; the Rugians, a foreign tribe, assumed the privilege of election: and Totila, the nephew of the late king, was tempted, by revenge, to deliver himself and the garrison of <PERSON>Trevigo</PERSON> into the hands of the Romans.
 But the gallant and accomplished youth was easily persuaded to prefer the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne before the service of Justinian; and as soon as the palace of <GPE>Pavia</GPE> had been purified from the <NORP>Rugian</NORP> usurper, he reviewed the national force of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers, and generously undertook the restoration of the kingdom of Italy.
 Victories of Totila, king of Italy, A.
D.
 541-544.
 The successors of Belisarius, <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> generals of equal rank, neglected to crush the feeble and disunited Goths, till they were roused to action by the progress of <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> and the reproaches of Justinian.
 The gates of <GPE>Verona</GPE> were secretly opened to Artabazus, at the head of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred <NORP>Persians</NORP> in the service of the empire.
 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> fled from the city.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> furlongs the <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals halted to regulate the division of the spoil.
 While they disputed, the enemy discovered the real number of the victors: the <NORP>Persians</NORP> were instantly overpowered, and it was by leaping from the wall that <PERSON>Artabazus</PERSON> preserved a life which he lost in a few days by the lance of a Barbarian, who had defied him to single combat.
 Twenty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Romans</NORP> encountered the forces of Totila, near Faenza, and on the hills of Mugello, of the <NORP>Florentine</NORP> territory.
 The ardor of freedmen, who fought to regain their country, was opposed to the languid temper of mercenary troops, who were even destitute of the merits of strong and well-disciplined servitude.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attack, they abandoned their ensigns, threw down their arms, and dispersed on all sides with an active speed, which abated the loss, whilst it aggravated the shame, of their defeat.
 The king of the Goths, who blushed for the baseness of his enemies, pursued with rapid steps the path of honor and victory.
 <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> passed the Po, traversed the Apennine, suspended the important conquest of Ravenna, Florence, and Rome, and marched through the heart of Italy, to form the siege or rather the blockade, of Naples.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> chiefs, imprisoned in their respective cities, and accusing each other of the common disgrace, did not presume to disturb his enterprise.
 But the emperor, alarmed by the distress and danger of his <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests, despatched to the relief of <GPE>Naples</GPE> a fleet of galleys and a body of <NORP>Thracian</NORP> and <NORP>Armenian</NORP> soldiers.
 They landed in Sicily, which yielded its copious stores of provisions; but the delays of the new commander, an unwarlike magistrate, protracted the sufferings of the besieged; and the succors, which he dropped with a timid and tardy hand, were successively intercepted by the armed vessels stationed by <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> in the Bay of Naples.
 The principal officer of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was dragged, with a rope round his neck, to the foot of the wall, from whence, with a trembling voice, he exhorted the citizens to implore, like himself, the mercy of the conqueror.
 They requested a truce, with a promise of surrendering the city, if no effectual relief should appear at the end of thirty days.
 Instead of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> month, the audacious <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> granted them three, in the just confidence that famine would anticipate the term of their capitulation.
 After the reduction of <GPE>Naples</GPE> and Cumae, the provinces of Lucania, Apulia, and Calabria, submitted to the king of the Goths.
 <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> led his army to the gates of Rome, pitched his camp at Tibur, or Tivoli, within twenty miles of the capital, and calmly exhorted the senate and people to compare the tyranny of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> with the blessings of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> reign.
 Contrast of vice and virtue.
 The rapid success of <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> may be partly ascribed to the revolution which <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years' experience had produced in the sentiments of the Italians.
 At the command, or at least in the name, of a <NORP>Catholic</NORP> emperor, the pope, (7) their spiritual father, had been torn from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, and either starved or murdered on a desolate island.
 (8) The virtues of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> were replaced by the various or uniform vices of <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> chiefs, at Rome, Ravenna, Florence, Perugia, Spoleto, etc.
, who abused their authority for the indulgence of lust or avarice.
 The improvement of the revenue was committed to Alexander, a subtle scribe, long practised in the fraud and oppression of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> schools, and whose name of Psalliction, the scissars, (9) was drawn from the dexterous artifice with which he reduced the size without defacing the figure, of the gold coin.
 Instead of expecting the restoration of peace and industry, he imposed a heavy assessment on the fortunes of the Italians.
 Yet his present or future demands were less odious than a prosecution of arbitrary rigor against the persons and property of all those who, under the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kings, had been concerned in the receipt and expenditure of the public money.
 The subjects of Justinian, who escaped these partial vexations, were oppressed by the irregular maintenance of the soldiers, whom <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> defrauded and despised; and their hasty sallies in quest of wealth, or subsistence, provoked the inhabitants of the country to await or implore their deliverance from the virtues of a Barbarian.
 <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> (10) was chaste and temperate; and none were deceived, either friends or enemies, who depended on his faith or his clemency.
 To the husbandmen of <GPE>Italy</GPE> the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king issued a welcome proclamation, enjoining them to pursue their important labors, and to rest assured, that, on the payment of the ordinary taxes, they should be defended by his valor and discipline from the injuries of war.
 The strong towns he successively attacked; and as soon as they had yielded to his arms, he demolished the fortifications, to save the people from the calamities of a future siege, to deprive the <NORP>Romans</NORP> of the arts of defence, and to decide the tedious quarrel of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, by an equal and honorable conflict in the field of battle.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> captives and deserters were tempted to enlist in the service of a liberal and courteous adversary; the slaves were attracted by the firm and faithful promise, that they should never be delivered to their masters; and from the <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors of Pavia, a new people, under the same appellation of Goths, was insensibly formed in the camp of Totila.
 He sincerely accomplished the articles of capitulation, without seeking or accepting any sinister advantage from ambiguous expressions or unforeseen events: the garrison of <GPE>Naples</GPE> had stipulated that they should be transported by sea; the obstinacy of the winds prevented their voyage, but they were generously supplied with horses, provisions, and a safe-conduct to the gates of Rome.
 The wives of the senators, who had been surprised in the villas of Campania, were restored, without a ransom, to their husbands; the violation of female chastity was inexorably chastised with death; and in the salutary regulation of the edict of the famished Neapolitans, the conqueror assumed the office of a humane and attentive physician.
 The virtues of <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> are equally laudable, whether they proceeded from true policy, religious principle, or the instinct of humanity: he often harangued his troops; and it was his constant theme, that national vice and ruin are inseparably connected; that victory is the fruit of moral as well as military virtue; and that the prince, and even the people, are responsible for the crimes which they neglect to punish.
 <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> command of <GPE>Belissarius</GPE> in Italy, A.
D.
 544-548.
 The return of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> to save the country which he had subdued, was pressed with equal vehemence by his friends and enemies; and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war was imposed as a trust or an exile on the veteran commander.
 A hero on the banks of the Euphrates, a slave in the palace of Constantinople, he accepted with reluctance the painful task of supporting his own reputation, and retrieving the faults of his successors.
 The sea was open to the Romans: the ships and soldiers were assembled at Salona, near the palace of Diocletian: he refreshed and reviewed his troops at <GPE>Pola</GPE> in Istria, coasted round the head of the Adriatic, entered the port of Ravenna, and despatched orders rather than supplies to the subordinate cities.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> public oration was addressed to the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Romans, in the name of the emperor, who had suspended for a while the conquest of Persia, and listened to the prayers of his <NORP>Italian</NORP> subjects.
 He gently touched on the causes and the authors of the recent disasters; striving to remove the fear of punishment for the past, and the hope of impunity for the future, and laboring, with more zeal than success, to unite all the members of his government in a firm league of affection and obedience.
 Justinian, his gracious master, was inclined to pardon and reward; and it was their interest, as well as duty, to reclaim their deluded brethren, who had been seduced by the arts of the usurper.
 Not a man was tempted to desert the standard of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> soon discovered, that he was sent to remain the idle and impotent spectator of the glory of a young Barbarian; and his own epistle exhibits a genuine and lively picture of the distress of a noble mind.
 An officer in whom <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> confided was sent from <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> to hasten and conduct the succours; but the message was neglected, and the messenger was detained at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by an advantageous marriage.
 After his patience had been exhausted by delay and disappointment, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general repassed the Adriatic, and expected at <ORG>Dyrrachium</ORG> the arrival of the troops, which were slowly assembled among the subjects and allies of the empire.
 His powers were still inadequate to the deliverance of Rome, which was closely besieged by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king.
 The <NORP>Appian</NORP> way, a march of forty days, was covered by the Barbarians; and as the prudence of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> declined a battle, he preferred the safe and speedy navigation of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> days from the coast of <LOC>Epirus</LOC> to the mouth of the Tyber.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> besieged by the Goths, A.
D.
 546, May.
 After reducing, by force, or treaty, the towns of inferior note in the midland provinces of Italy, <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> proceeded, not to assault, but to encompass and starve, the ancient capital.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was afflicted by the avarice, and guarded by the valor, of Bessas, a veteran chief of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> extraction, who filled, with a garrison of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers, the spacious circle of her venerable walls.
 From the distress of the people he extracted a profitable trade, and secretly rejoiced in the continuance of the siege.
 It was for his use that the granaries had been replenished: the charity of Pope <PERSON>Vigilius</PERSON> had purchased and embarked an ample supply of <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> corn; but the vessels which escaped the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were seized by a rapacious governor, who imparted a scanty sustenance to the soldiers, and sold the remainder to the wealthy Romans.
 The medimnus, or <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> part of the <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of wheat, was exchanged for <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> pieces were given for an ox, a rare and accidental prize; the progress of famine enhanced this exorbitant value, and the mercenaries were tempted to deprive themselves of the allowance which was scarcely sufficient for the support of life.
 A tasteless and unwholesome mixture, in which the bran thrice exceeded the quantity of flour, appeased the hunger of the poor; they were gradually reduced to feed on dead horses, dogs, cats, and mice, and eagerly to snatch the grass, and even the nettles, which grew among the ruins of the city.
 A crowd of spectres, pale and emaciated, their bodies oppressed with disease, and their minds with despair, surrounded the palace of the governor, urged, with unavailing truth, that it was the duty of a master to maintain his slaves, and humbly requested that he would provide for their subsistence, to permit their flight, or command their immediate execution.
 <PERSON>Bessas</PERSON> replied, with unfeeling tranquillity, that it was impossible to feed, unsafe to dismiss, and unlawful to kill, the subjects of the emperor.
 Yet the example of a private citizen might have shown his countrymen that a tyrant cannot withhold the privilege of death.
 Pierced by the cries of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> children, who vainly called on their father for bread, he ordered them to follow his steps, advanced with calm and silent despair to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the bridges of the Tyber, and, covering his face, threw himself headlong into the stream, in the presence of his family and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 To the rich and pusillammous, <PERSON>Bessas</PERSON> (12) sold the permission of departure; but the greatest part of the fugitives expired on the public highways, or were intercepted by the flying parties of Barbarians.
 In the mean while, the artful governor soothed the discontent, and revived the hopes of the Romans, by the vague reports of the fleets and armies which were hastening to their relief from the extremities of the East.
 They derived more rational comfort from the assurance that <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> had landed at the port; and, without numbering his forces, they firmly relied on the humanity, the courage, and the skill of their great deliverer.
 Attempt of Belisarius.
 The foresight of <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> had raised obstacles worthy of such an antagonist.
 Ninety furlongs below the city, in the narrowest part of the river, he joined the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> banks by strong and solid timbers in the form of a bridge, on which he erected <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> lofty towers, manned by the bravest of his Goths, and profusely stored with missile weapons and engines of offence.
 The approach of the bridge and towers was covered by a strong and massy chain of iron; and the chain, at either end, on the opposite sides of the Tyber, was defended by a numerous and chosen detachment of archers.
 But the enterprise of forcing these barriers, and relieving the capital, displays a shining example of the boldness and conduct of Belisarius.
 His cavalry advanced from the port along the public road, to awe the motions, and distract the attention of the enemy.
 His infantry and provisions were distributed in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred large boats; and each boat was shielded by a high rampart of thick planks, pierced with many small holes for the discharge of missile weapons.
 In the front, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> large vessels were linked together to sustain a floating castle, which commanded the towers of the bridge, and contained a magazine of fire, sulphur, and bitumen.
 The whole fleet, which the general led in person, was laboriously moved against the current of the river.
 The chain yielded to their weight, and the enemies who guarded the banks were either slain or scattered.
 As soon as they touched the principal barrier, the fire- ship was instantly grappled to the bridge; <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the towers, with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred Goths, was consumed by the flames; the assailants shouted victory; and <GPE>Rome</GPE> was saved, if the wisdom of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> had not been defeated by the misconduct of his officers.
 He had previously sent orders to <PERSON>Bessas</PERSON> to <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> his operations by a timely sally from the town; and he had fixed his lieutenant, Isaac, by a peremptory command, to the station of the port.
 But avarice rendered <PERSON>Bessas</PERSON> immovable; while the youthful ardor of <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> delivered him into the hands of a superior enemy.
 The exaggerated rumor of his defeat was hastily carried to the ears of Belisarius: he paused; betrayed in that single moment of his life some emotions of surprise and perplexity; and reluctantly sounded a retreat to save his wife Antonina, his treasures, and the only harbor which he possessed on the <NORP>Tuscan</NORP> coast.
 The vexation of his mind produced an ardent and almost mortal fever; and <GPE>Rome</GPE> was left without protection to the mercy or indignation of Totila.
 The continuance of hostilities had imbittered the national hatred: the <NORP>Arian</NORP> clergy was ignominiously driven from Rome; Pelagius, the archdeacon, returned without success from an embassy to the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and a <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> bishop, the envoy or nuncio of the pope, was deprived of both his hands, for daring to utter falsehoods in the service of the church and state.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> taken by the Goths, A.
D.
 546, Dec.
 17.
 Famine had relaxed the strength and discipline of the garrison of Rome.
 They could derive no effectual service from a dying people; and the inhuman avarice of the merchant at length absorbed the vigilance of the governor.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> <NORP>Isaurian</NORP> sentinels, while their companions slept, and their officers were absent, descended by a rope from the wall, and secretly proposed to the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king to introduce his troops into the city.
 The offer was entertained with coldness and suspicion; they returned in safety; they twice repeated their visit; the place was twice examined; the conspiracy was known and disregarded; and no sooner had <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> consented to the attempt, than they unbarred the <NORP>Asinarian</NORP> gate, and gave admittance to the Goths.
 Till the dawn of day, they halted in order of battle, apprehensive of treachery or ambush; but the troops of Bessas, with their leader, had already escaped; and when the king was pressed to disturb their retreat, he prudently replied, that no sight could be more grateful than that of a flying enemy.
 The patricians, who were still possessed of horses, Decius, Basilius, etc.
 accompanied the governor; their brethren, among whom Olybrius, Orestes, and Maximus, are named by the historian, took refuge in the church of St.
 Peter: but the assertion, that only <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred persons remained in the capital, inspires some doubt of the fidelity either of his narrative or of his text.
 As soon as daylight had displayed the entire victory of the Goths, their monarch devoutly visited the tomb of the prince of the apostles; but while he prayed at the altar, <CARDINAL>twenty-five</CARDINAL> soldiers, and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> citizens, were put to the sword in the vestibule of the temple.
 The archdeacon <PERSON>Pelagius</PERSON> (13) stood before him, with the <PERSON>Gospels</PERSON> in his hand.
 At his humble prayer, the lives of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were spared; and the chastity of the maids and matrons was preserved inviolate from the passions of the hungry soldiers.
 But they were rewarded by the freedom of pillage, after the most precious spoils had been reserved for the royal treasury.
 The houses of the senators were plentifully stored with gold and silver; and the avarice of <PERSON>Bessas</PERSON> had laboured with so much guilt and shame for the benefit of the conqueror.
 In this revolution, the sons and daughters of <NORP>Roman</NORP> consuls lasted the misery which they had spurned or relieved, wandered in tattered garments through the streets of the city and begged their bread, perhaps without success, before the gates of their hereditary mansions.
 The riches of Rusticiana, the daughter of <PERSON>Symmachus</PERSON> and widow of Boethius, had been generously devoted to alleviate the calamities of famine.
 But the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were exasperated by the report, that she had prompted the people to overthrow the statues of the great Theodoric; and the life of that venerable matron would have been sacrificed to his memory, if <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> had not respected her birth, her virtues, and even the pious motive of her revenge.
 The next day he pronounced <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> orations, to congratulate and admonish his victorious Goths, and to reproach the senate, as the vilest of slaves, with their perjury, folly, and ingratitude; sternly declaring, that their estates and honours were justly forfeited to the companions of his arms.
 Yet he consented to forgive their revolt; and the senators repaid his clemency by despatching circular letters to their tenants and vassals in the provinces of Italy, strictly to enjoin them to desert the standard of the Greeks, to cultivate their lands in peace, and to learn from their masters the duty of obedience to a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> sovereign.
 Against the city which had so long delayed the course of his victories, he appeared inexorable: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of the walls, in different parts, were demolished by his command; fire and engines prepared to consume or subvert the most stately works of antiquity; and the world was astonished by the fatal decree, that <GPE>Rome</GPE> should be changed into a pasture for cattle.
 The firm and temperate remonstrance of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> suspended the execution; he warned the <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> not to sully his fame by the destruction of those monuments which were the glory of the dead, and the delight of the living; and <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> was persuaded, by the advice of an enemy, to preserve <GPE>Rome</GPE> as the ornament of his kingdom, or the fairest pledge of peace and reconciliation.
 When he had signified to the ambassadors of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> his intention of sparing the city, he stationed an army at the distance of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and twenty furlongs, to observe the motions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general.
 With the remainder of his forces he marched into <GPE>Lucania</GPE> and Apulia, and occupied on the summit of Mount Garganus (14) <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the camps of Hannibal.
 (15) The senators were dragged in his train, and afterwards confined in the fortresses of Campania: the citizens, with their wives and children, were dispersed in exile; and during forty days <GPE>Rome</GPE> was abandoned to desolate and dreary solitude.
 (16) Recovered by Belisarius, A.
D.
 547, February.
 The loss of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was speedily retrieved by an action, to which, according to the event, the public opinion would apply the names of rashness or heroism.
 After the departure of Totila, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general sallied from the port at the head of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse, cut in pieces the enemy who opposed his progress, and visited with pity and reverence the vacant space of the eternal city.
 Resolved to maintain a station so conspicuous in the eyes of mankind, he summoned the greatest part of his troops to the standard which he erected on the Capitol: the old inhabitants were recalled by the love of their country and the hopes of food; and the keys of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were sent a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time to the emperor Justinian.
 The walls, as far as they had been demolished by the Goths, were repaired with rude and dissimilar materials; the ditch was restored; iron spikes (17) were profusely scattered in the highways to annoy the feet of the horses; and as new gates could not suddenly be procured, the entrance was guarded by a <NORP>Spartan</NORP> rampart of his bravest soldiers.
 At the expiration of <CARDINAL>twenty-five</CARDINAL> days, <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> returned by hasty marches from <GPE>Apulia</GPE> to avenge the injury and disgrace.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> expected his approach.
 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> were thrice repulsed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> general assaults; they lost the flower of their troops; the royal standard had almost fallen into the hands of the enemy, and the fame of <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> sunk, as it had risen, with the fortune of his arms.
 Whatever skill and courage could achieve, had been performed by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general: it remained only that <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> should terminate, by a strong and seasonable effort, the war which he had ambitiously undertaken.
 The indolence, perhaps the impotence, of a prince who despised his enemies, and envied his servants, protracted the calamities of Italy.
 After a long silence, <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was commanded to leave a sufficient garrison at Rome, and to transport himself into the province of Lucania, whose inhabitants, inflamed by <NORP>Catholic</NORP> zeal, had cast away the yoke of their <NORP>Arian</NORP> conquerors.
 In this ignoble warfare, the hero, invincible against the power of the Barbarians, was basely vanquished by the delay, the disobedience, and the cowardice of his own officers.
 He reposed in his <DATE>winter</DATE> quarters of Crotona, in the full assurance, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> passes of the <NORP>Lucanian</NORP> hills were guarded by his cavalry.
 They were betrayed by treachery or weakness; and the rapid march of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> scarcely allowed time for the escape of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> to the coast of Sicily.
 At length a fleet and army were assembled for the relief of Ruscianum, or Rossano, (18) a fortress <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> furlongs from the ruins of Sybaris, where the nobles of <GPE>Lucania</GPE> had taken refuge.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attempt, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> forces were dissipated by a storm.
 In the second, they approached the shore; but they saw the hills covered with archers, the landing-place defended by a line of spears, and the king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> impatient for battle.
 The conqueror of <GPE>Italy</GPE> retired with a sigh, and continued to languish, inglorious and inactive, till Antonina, who had been sent to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to solicit succors, obtained, after the death of the empress, the permission of his return.
 Final recall of Belisarius, A.
D.
 548, September.
 The <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> last campaigns of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> might abate the envy of his competitors, whose eyes had been dazzled and wounded by the blaze of his former glory.
 Instead of delivering <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the Goths, he had wandered like a fugitive along the coast, without daring to march into the country, or to accept the bold and repeated challenge of Totila.
 Yet, in the judgment of the few who could discriminate counsels from events, and compare the instruments with the execution, he appeared a more consummate master of the art of war, than in the season of his prosperity, when he presented <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> captive kings before the throne of Justinian.
 The valor of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was not chilled by age: his prudence was matured by experience; but the moral virtues of humanity and justice seem to have yielded to the hard necessity of the times.
 The parsimony or poverty of the emperor compelled him to deviate from the rule of conduct which had deserved the love and confidence of the Italians.
 The war was maintained by the oppression of Ravenna, Sicily, and all the faithful subjects of the empire; and the rigorous prosecution of <PERSON>Herodian</PERSON> provoked that injured or guilty officer to deliver <GPE>Spoleto</GPE> into the hands of the enemy.
 The avarice of Antonina, which had been some times diverted by love, now reigned without a rival in her breast.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> himself had always understood, that riches, in a corrupt age, are the support and ornament of personal merit.
 And it cannot be presumed that he should stain his honor for the public service, without applying a part of the spoil to his private emolument.
 The hero had escaped the sword of the Barbarians.
 But the dagger of conspiracy (19) awaited his return.
 In the midst of wealth and honors, Artaban, who had chastised the <NORP>African</NORP> tyrant, complained of the ingratitude of courts.
 He aspired to Praejecta, the emperor's niece, who wished to reward her deliverer; but the impediment of his previous marriage was asserted by the piety of Theodora.
 The pride of royal descent was irritated by flattery; and the service in which he gloried had proved him capable of bold and sanguinary deeds.
 The death of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was resolved, but the conspirators delayed the execution till they could surprise <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> disarmed, and naked, in the palace of Constantinople.
 Not a hope could be entertained of shaking his long-tried fidelity; and they justly dreaded the revenge, or rather the justice, of the veteran general, who might speedily assemble an army in <LOC>Thrace</LOC> to punish the assassins, and perhaps to enjoy the fruits of their crime.
 Delay afforded time for rash communications and honest confessions: <GPE>Artaban</GPE> and his accomplices were condemned by the senate, but the extreme clemency of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> detained them in the gentle confinement of the palace, till he pardoned their flagitious attempt against his throne and life.
 If the emperor forgave his enemies, he must cordially embrace a friend whose victories were alone remembered, and who was endeared to his prince by the recent circumstances of their common danger.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> reposed from his toils, in the high station of general of the <LOC>East</LOC> and count of the domestics; and the older consuls and patricians respectfully yielded the precedency of rank to the peerless merit of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the Romans.
 (20) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> still submitted to be the slave of his wife; but the servitude of habit and affection became less disgraceful when the death of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> had removed the baser influence of fear.
 Joannina, their daughter, and the sole heiress of their fortunes, was betrothed to Anastasius, the grandson, or rather the nephew, of the empress, (21) whose kind interposition forwarded the consummation of their youthful loves.
 But the power of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> expired, the parents of <PERSON>Joannina</PERSON> returned, and her honor, perhaps her happiness, were sacrificed to the revenge of an unfeeling mother, who dissolved the imperfect nuptials before they had been ratified by the ceremonies of the church.
 (22) <GPE>Rome</GPE> again taken by the Goths, A.
D.
 549.
 Before the departure of Belisarius, <GPE>Perusia</GPE> was besieged, and few cities were impregnable to the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms.
 Ravenna, Ancona, and Crotona, still resisted the Barbarians; and when <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> asked in marriage <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the daughters of France, he was stung by the just reproach that the king of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was unworthy of his title till it was acknowledged by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 Three <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the bravest soldiers had been left to defend the capital.
 On the suspicion of a monopoly, they massacred the governor, and announced to Justinian, by a deputation of the clergy, that unless their offence was pardoned, and their arrears were satisfied, they should instantly accept the tempting offers of Totila.
 But the officer who succeeded to the command (his name was Diogenes) deserved their esteem and confidence; and the Goths, instead of finding an easy conquest, encountered a vigorous resistance from the soldiers and people, who patiently endured the loss of the port and of all maritime supplies.
 The siege of <GPE>Rome</GPE> would perhaps have been raised, if the liberality of <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> to the <NORP>Isaurians</NORP> had not encouraged some of their venal countrymen to copy the example of treason.
 In a dark night, while the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> trumpets sounded on another side, they silently opened the gate of St.
 Paul: the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> rushed into the city; and the flying garrison was intercepted before they could reach the harbor of Centumcellae.
 A soldier trained in the school of Belisarius, <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> of Cilicia, retired with four hundred men to the mole of Hadrian.
 They repelled the Goths; but they felt the approach of famine; and their aversion to the taste of horse-flesh confirmed their resolution to risk the event of a desperate and decisive sally.
 But their spirit insensibly stooped to the offers of capitulation; they retrieved their arrears of pay, and preserved their arms and horses, by enlisting in the service of Totila; their chiefs, who pleaded a laudable attachment to their wives and children in the East, were dismissed with honor; and above four hundred enemies, who had taken refuge in the sanctuaries, were saved by the clemency of the victor.
 He no longer entertained a wish of destroying the edifices of Rome, (23) which he now respected as the seat of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kingdom: the senate and people were restored to their country; the means of subsistence were liberally provided; and Totila, in the robe of peace, exhibited the equestrian games of the circus.
 Whilst he amused the eyes of the multitude, four hundred vessels were prepared for the embarkation of his troops.
 The cities of <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and <GPE>Tarentum</GPE> were reduced: he passed into Sicily, the object of his implacable resentment; and the island was stripped of its gold and silver, of the fruits of the earth, and of an infinite number of horses, sheep, and oxen.
 <GPE>Sardinia</GPE> and <GPE>Corsica</GPE> obeyed the fortune of Italy; and the sea-coast of <GPE>Greece</GPE> was visited by a fleet of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred galleys.
 (24) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> were landed in <LOC>Corcyra</LOC> and the ancient continent of Epirus; they advanced as far as Nicopolis, the trophy of Augustus, and Dodona, (25) once famous by the oracle of Jove.
 In every step of his victories, the wise <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> repeated to <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> the desire of peace, applauded the concord of their predecessors, and offered to employ the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms in the service of the empire.
 Preparations by <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> for the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war, A.
D.
 549-551.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was deaf to the voice of peace: but he neglected the prosecution of war; and the indolence of his temper disappointed, in some degree, the obstinacy of his passions.
 From this salutary slumber the emperor was awakened by the pope <PERSON>Vigilius</PERSON> and the patrician Cethegus, who appeared before his throne, and adjured him, in the name of God and the people, to resume the conquest and deliverance of Italy.
 In the choice of the generals, caprice, as well as judgment, was shown.
 A fleet and army sailed for the relief of Sicily, under the conduct of Liberius; but his youth and want of experience were afterwards discovered, and before he touched the shores of the island he was overtaken by his successor.
 In the place of Liberius, the conspirator <GPE>Artaban</GPE> was raised from a prison to military honors; in the pious presumption, that gratitude would animate his valor and fortify his allegiance.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> reposed in the shade of his laurels, but the command of the principal army was reserved for Germanus, (26) the emperor's nephew, whose rank and merit had been long depressed by the jealousy of the court.
 <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> had injured him in the rights of a private citizen, the marriage of his children, and the testament of his brother; and although his conduct was pure and blameless, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was displeased that he should be thought worthy of the confidence of the malecontents.
 The life of <NORP>Germanus</NORP> was a lesson of implicit obedience: he nobly refused to prostitute his name and character in the factions of the circus: the gravity of his manners was tempered by innocent cheerfulness; and his riches were lent without interest to indigent or deserving friends.
 His valor had formerly triumphed over the <NORP>Sclavonians</NORP> of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the rebels of Africa: the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> report of his promotion revived the hopes of the Italians; and he was privately assured, that a crowd of <NORP>Roman</NORP> deserters would abandon, on his approach, the standard of Totila.
 His <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> marriage with Malasontha, the granddaughter of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> endeared <NORP>Germanus</NORP> to the <NORP>Goths</NORP> themselves; and they marched with reluctance against the father of a royal infant the last offspring of the line of Amali.
 (27) A splendid allowance was assigned by the emperor: the general contribute his private fortune: his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons were popular and active and he surpassed, in the promptitude and success of his levies the expectation of mankind.
 He was permitted to select some squadrons of <NORP>Thracian</NORP> cavalry: the veterans, as well as the youth of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Europe, engaged their voluntary service; and as far as the heart of Germany, his fame and liberality attracted the aid of the Barbarians.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> advanced to Sardica; an army of <NORP>Sclavonians</NORP> fled before their march; but within <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days of their final departure, the designs of <NORP>Germanus</NORP> were terminated by his malady and death.
 Yet the impulse which he had given to the <NORP>Italian</NORP> war still continued to act with energy and effect.
 The maritime towns Ancona, Crotona, Centumcellae, resisted the assaults of <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> <GPE>Sicily</GPE> was reduced by the zeal of Artaban, and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> navy was defeated near the coast of the Adriatic.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fleets were almost equal, forty-seven to <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> galleys: the victory was decided by the knowledge and dexterity of the Greeks; but the ships were so closely grappled, that only <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> escaped from this unfortunate conflict.
 They affected to depreciate an element in which they were unskilled; but their own experience confirmed the truth of a maxim, that the master of the sea will always acquire the dominion of the land.
 (28) Character and expedition of the eunuch Narses, A.
D.
 552.
 After the loss of Germanus, the nations were provoked to smile, by the strange intelligence, that the command of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies was given to a eunuch.
 But the eunuch <NORP>Narses</NORP> (29) is ranked among the few who have rescued that unhappy name from the contempt and hatred of mankind.
 A feeble, diminutive body concealed the soul of a statesman and a warrior.
 His youth had been employed in the management of the loom and distaff, in the cares of the household, and the service of female luxury; but while his hands were busy, he secretly exercised the faculties of a vigorous and discerning mind.
 A stranger to the schools and the camp, he studied in the palace to dissemble, to flatter, and to persuade; and as soon as he approached the person of the emperor, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> listened with surprise and pleasure to the manly counsels of his chamberlain and private treasurer.
 (30) The talents of <NORP>Narses</NORP> were tried and improved in frequent embassies: he led an army into <GPE>Italy</GPE> acquired a practical knowledge of the war and the country, and presumed to strive with the genius of Belisarius.
 Twelve <DATE>years</DATE> after his return, the eunuch was chosen to achieve the conquest which had been left imperfect by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals.
 Instead of being dazzled by vanity or emulation, he seriously declared that, unless he were armed with an adequate force, he would never consent to risk his own glory and that of his sovereign.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> granted to the favorite what he might have denied to the hero: the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war was rekindled from its ashes, and the preparations were not unworthy of the ancient majesty of the empire.
 The key of the public treasure was put into his hand, to collect magazines, to levy soldiers, to purchase arms and horses, to discharge the arrears of pay, and to tempt the fidelity of the fugitives and deserters.
 The troops of <NORP>Germanus</NORP> were still in arms; they halted at <GPE>Salona</GPE> in the expectation of a new leader; and legions of subjects and allies were created by the well-known liberality of the eunuch Narses.
 The king of the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> (31) satisfied or surpassed the obligations of a treaty, by lending <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred of his bravest warriors, who were followed by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of their martial attendants.
 Three <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Heruli</PERSON> fought on horseback under Philemuth, their native chief; and the noble Aratus, who adopted the manners and discipline of Rome, conducted a band of veterans of the same nation.
 <PERSON>Dagistheus</PERSON> was released from prison to command the Huns; and Kobad, the grandson and nephew of the great king, was conspicuous by the regal tiara at the head of his faithful Persians, who had devoted themselves to the fortunes of their prince.
 (32) Absolute in the exercise of his authority, more absolute in the affection of his troops, <NORP>Narses</NORP> led a numerous and gallant army from <GPE>Philippopolis</GPE> to Salona, from whence he coasted the eastern side of the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> as far as the confines of Italy.
 His progress was checked.
 The <LOC>East</LOC> could not supply vessels capable of transporting such multitudes of men and horses.
 The Franks, who, in the general confusion, had usurped the greater part of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> province, refused a free passage to the friends of the Lombards.
 The station of <GPE>Verona</GPE> was occupied by Teias, with the flower of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> forces; and that skilful commander had overspread the adjacent country with the fall of woods and the inundation of waters.
 (33) In this perplexity, an officer of experience proposed a measure, secure by the appearance of rashness; that the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army should cautiously advance along the seashore, while the fleet preceded their march, and successively cast a bridge of boats over the mouths of the rivers, the Timavus, the Brenta, the Adige, and the Po, that fall into the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> to the north of Ravenna.
 Nine days he reposed in the city, collected the fragments of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> army, and marching towards <GPE>Rimini</GPE> to meet the defiance of an insulting enemy.
 Defeat and death of Totila, A.
D.
 552, July.
 The prudence of <NORP>Narses</NORP> impelled him to speedy and decisive action.
 His powers were the last effort of the state; the cost of each day accumulated the enormous account; and the nations, untrained to discipline or fatigue, might be rashly provoked to turn their arms against each other, or against their benefactor.
 The same considerations might have tempered the ardor of Totila.
 But he was conscious that the clergy and people of <GPE>Italy</GPE> aspired to a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> revolution: he felt or suspected the rapid progress of treason; and he resolved to risk the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kingdom on the chance of a day, in which the valiant would be animated by instant danger and the disaffected might be awed by mutual ignorance.
 In his march from Ravenna, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general chastised the garrison of Rimini, traversed in a direct line the hills of Urbino, and reentered the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way, nine miles beyond the perforated rock, an obstacle of art and nature which might have stopped or retarded his progress.
 (34) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> were assembled in the neighborhood of Rome, they advanced without delay to seek a superior enemy, and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies approached each other at the distance of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred furlongs, between <GPE>Tagina</GPE> (35) and the sepulchres of the Gauls.
 (36) The haughty message of <NORP>Narses</NORP> was an offer, not of peace, but of pardon.
 The answer of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king declared his resolution to die or conquer.
 "What day," said the messenger, "will you fix for the combat?" "The <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> day," replied Totila; but early the next morning he attempted to surprise a foe, suspicious of deceit, and prepared for battle.
 Ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Heruli</PERSON> and Lombards, of approved valour and doubtful faith, were placed in the centre.
 Each of the wings was composed of eight <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Romans; the right was guarded by the cavalry of the Huns, the left was covered by fifteen hundred chosen horse, destined, according to the emergencies of action, to sustain the retreat of their friends, or to encompass the flank of the enemy.
 From his proper station at the head of the right wing, the eunuch rode along the line, expressing by his voice and countenance the assurance of victory; exciting the soldiers of the emperor to punish the guilt and madness of a band of robbers; and exposing to their view gold chains, collars, and bracelets, the rewards of military virtue.
 From the event of a single combat they drew an omen of success; and they beheld with pleasure the courage of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> archers, who maintained a small eminence against <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> successive attacks of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry.
 At the distance only of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bow-shots, the armies spent the morning in dreadful suspense, and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> tasted some necessary food, without unloosing the cuirass from their breast, or the bridle from their horses.
 <NORP>Narses</NORP> awaited the charge; and it was delayed by <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> till he had received his last succours of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Goths.
 While he consumed the hours in fruitless treaty, the king exhibited in a narrow space the strength and agility of a warrior.
 His armour was enchased with gold; his purple banner floated with the wind: he cast his lance into the air; caught it with the right hand; shifted it to the left; threw himself backwards; recovered his seat; and managed a fiery steed in all the paces and evolutions of the equestrian school.
 As soon as the succours had arrived, he retired to his tent, assumed the dress and arms of a private soldier, and gave the signal of a battle.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> line of cavalry advanced with more courage than discretion, and left behind them the infantry of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line.
 They were soon engaged between the horns of a crescent, into which the adverse wings had been insensibly curved, and were saluted from either side by the volleys of four <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> archers.
 Their ardor, and even their distress, drove them forwards to a close and unequal conflict, in which they could only use their lances against an enemy equally skilled in all the instruments of war.
 A generous emulation inspired the <NORP>Romans</NORP> and their <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> allies; and Narses, who calmly viewed and directed their efforts, doubted to whom he should adjudge the prize of superior bravery.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry was astonished and disordered, pressed and broken; and the line of infantry, instead of presenting their spears, or opening their intervals, were trampled under the feet of the flying horse.
 Six <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were slaughtered without mercy in the field of Tagina.
 Their prince, with <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> attendants, was overtaken by Asbad, of the race of the Gepidae.
 "Spare the king of Italy," cried a loyal voice, and <PERSON>Asbad</PERSON> struck his lance through the body of Totila.
 The blow was instantly revenged by the faithful Goths: they transported their dying monarch <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> miles beyond the scene of his disgrace; and his last moments were not embittered by the presence of an enemy.
 Compassion afforded him the shelter of an obscure tomb; but the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were not satisfied of their victory, till they beheld the corpse of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king.
 His hat, enriched with gems, and his bloody robe, were presented to <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> by the messengers of triumph.
 (37) Conquest of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by Narses.
 As soon as <NORP>Narses</NORP> had paid his devotions to the Author of victory, and the blessed Virgin, his peculiar patroness, (38) he praised, rewarded, and dismissed the Lombards.
 The villages had been reduced to ashes by these valiant savages; they ravished matrons and virgins on the altar; their retreat was diligently watched by a strong detachment of regular forces, who prevented a repetition of the like disorders.
 The victorious eunuch pursued his march through Tuscany, accepted the submission of the Goths, heard the acclamations, and often the complaints, of the Italians, and encompassed the walls of <GPE>Rome</GPE> with the remainder of his formidable host.
 Round the wide circumference, <NORP>Narses</NORP> assigned to himself, and to each of his lieutenants, a real or a feigned attack, while he silently marked the place of easy and unguarded entrance.
 Neither the fortifications of Hadrian's mole, nor of the port, could long delay the progress of the conqueror; and <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> once more received the keys of Rome, which, under his reign, had been <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times taken and recovered.
 (39) But the deliverance of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was the last calamity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 The <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> allies of <NORP>Narses</NORP> too frequently confounded the privileges of peace and war.
 The despair of the flying <NORP>Goths</NORP> found some consolation in sanguinary revenge; and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred youths of the noblest families, who had been sent as hostages beyond the Po, were inhumanly slain by the successor of Totila.
 The fate of the senate suggests an awful lesson of the vicissitude of human affairs.
 Of the senators whom <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> had banished from their country, some were rescued by an officer of Belisarius, and transported from <GPE>Campania</GPE> to Sicily; while others were too guilty to confide in the clemency of Justinian, or too poor to provide horses for their escape to the sea-shore.
 Their brethren languished <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> in a state of indigence and exile: the victory of <NORP>Narses</NORP> revived their hopes; but their premature return to the metropolis was prevented by the furious Goths; and all the fortresses of <GPE>Campania</GPE> were stained with patrician (40) blood.
 After a period of thirteen centuries, the institution of <GPE>Romulus</GPE> expired; and if the nobles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> still assumed the title of senators, few subsequent traces can be discovered of a public council, or constitutional order.
 Ascend <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred years, and contemplate the kings of the earth soliciting an audience, as the slaves or freedmen of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate! (41) Defeat and death of Teias, the last king of the Goths, A.

 553, March.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war was yet alive.
 The bravest of the nation retired beyond the Po; and <PERSON>Teias</PERSON> was unanimously chosen to succeed and revenge their departed hero.
 The new king immediately sent ambassadors to implore, or rather to purchase, the aid of the Franks, and nobly lavished, for the public safety, the riches which had been deposited in the palace of Pavia.
 The residue of the royal treasure was guarded by his brother Aligern, at Cumaea, in Campania; but the strong castle which <PERSON>Totila</PERSON> had fortified was closely besieged by the arms of Narses.
 From the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to the foot of Mount Vesuvius, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king, by rapid and secret marches, advanced to the relief of his brother, eluded the vigilance of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> chiefs, and pitched his camp on the banks of the <PRODUCT>Sarnus</PRODUCT> or Draco, (42) which flows from <GPE>Nuceria</GPE> into the Bay of Naples.
 The river separated the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies: <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> days were consumed in distant and fruitless combats, and <PERSON>Teias</PERSON> maintained this important post till he was deserted by his fleet and the hope of subsistence.
 With reluctant steps he ascended the Lactarian mount, where the physicians of Rome, since the time of Galen, had sent their patients for the benefit of the air and the milk.
 (43) But the <NORP>Goths</NORP> soon embraced a more generous resolution: to descend the hill, to dismiss their horses, and to die in arms, and in the possession of freedom.
 The king marched at their head, bearing in his right hand a lance, and an ample buckler in his left: with the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> he struck dead the foremost of the assailants; with the other he received the weapons which every hand was ambitious to aim against his life.
 After a combat of many hours, his left arm was fatigued by the weight of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> javelins which hung from his shield.
 Without moving from his ground, or suspending his blows, the hero called aloud on his attendants for a fresh buckler; but in the moment while his side was uncovered, it was pierced by a mortal dart.
 He fell; and his head, exalted on a spear, proclaimed to the nations that the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kingdom was no more.
 But the example of his death served only to animate the companions who had sworn to perish with their leader.
 They fought till darkness descended on the earth.
 They reposed on their arms.
 The combat was renewed with the return of light, and maintained with unabated vigor till the evening of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day.
 The repose of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> night, the want of water, and the loss of their bravest champions, determined the surviving <NORP>Goths</NORP> to accept the fair capitulation which the prudence of <NORP>Narses</NORP> was inclined to propose.
 They embraced the alternative of residing in Italy, as the subjects and soldiers of Justinian, or departing with a portion of their private wealth, in search of some independent country.
 (44) Yet the oath of fidelity or exile was alike rejected by <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Goths, who broke away before the treaty was signed, and boldly effected their retreat to the walls of Pavia.
 The spirit, as well as the situation, of <PERSON>Aligern</PERSON> prompted him to imitate rather than to bewail his brother: a strong and dexterous archer, he transpierced with a single arrow the armor and breast of his antagonist; and his military conduct defended <GPE>Cumae</GPE> (45) above a year against the forces of the Romans.
 Their industry had scooped the Sibyl's cave (46) into a prodigious mine; combustible materials were introduced to consume the temporary props: the wall and the gate of <GPE>Cumae</GPE> sunk into the cavern, but the ruins formed a deep and inaccessible precipice.
 On the fragment of a rock <PERSON>Aligern</PERSON> stood alone and unshaken, till he calmly surveyed the hopeless condition of his country, and judged it more honorable to be the friend of Narses, than the slave of the Franks.
 After the death of Teias, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general separated his troops to reduce the cities of Italy; <PERSON>Lucca</PERSON> sustained a long and vigorous siege: and such was the humanity or the prudence of Narses, that the repeated perfidy of the inhabitants could not provoke him to exact the forfeit lives of their hostages.
 These hostages were dismissed in safety; and their grateful zeal at length subdued the obstinacy of their countrymen.
 (47) Invasion of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the Franks, and Alamanni, A.
D.
 553, August.
 Before <PERSON>Lucca</PERSON> had surrendered, <GPE>Italy</GPE> was overwhelmed by a new deluge of Barbarians.
 A feeble youth, the grandson of Clovis, reigned over the <NORP>Austrasians</NORP> or oriental Franks.
 The guardians of <PERSON>Theodebald</PERSON> entertained with coldness and reluctance the magnificent promises of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> ambassadors.
 But the spirit of a martial people outstripped the timid counsels of the court: <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers, <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> and Buccelin, (48) the dukes of the Alemanni, stood forth as the leaders of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> war; and seventy-five <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Germans</NORP> descended in the autumn from the Rhaetian <LOC>Alps</LOC> into the plain of Milan.
 The vanguard of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army was stationed near the Po, under the conduct of Fulcaris, a bold Herulian, who rashly conceived that personal bravery was the sole duty and merit of a commander.
 As he marched without order or precaution along the <NORP>Aemilian</NORP> way, an ambuscade of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> suddenly rose from the amphitheatre of Parma; his troops were surprised and routed; but their leader refused to fly; declaring to the last moment, that death was less terrible than the angry countenance of Narses.
 The death of Fulcaris, and the retreat of the surviving chiefs, decided the fluctuating and rebellious temper of the Goths; they flew to the standard of their deliverers, and admitted them into the cities which still resisted the arms of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general.
 The conqueror of <GPE>Italy</GPE> opened a free passage to the irresistible torrent of Barbarians.
 They passed under the walls of Cesena, and answered by threats and reproaches the advice of Aligern, that the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> treasures could no longer repay the labor of an invasion.
 Two <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> were destroyed by the skill and valor of <NORP>Narses</NORP> himself, who sailed from <GPE>Rimini</GPE> at the head of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred horse, to chastise the licentious rapine of their march.
 On the confines of <ORG>Samnium</ORG> the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers divided their forces.
 With the right wing, <NORP>Buccelin</NORP> assumed the spoil of Campania, Lucania, and Bruttium; with the left, <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> accepted the plunder of <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Calabria.
 They followed the coast of the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> and the Adriatic, as far as <LOC>Rhegium</LOC> and Otranto, and the extreme lands of <GPE>Italy</GPE> were the term of their destructive progress.
 The Franks, who were <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Catholics, contented themselves with simple pillage and occasional murder.
 But the churches which their piety had spared, were stripped by the sacrilegious hands of the Alamanni, who sacrificed horses' heads to their native deities of the woods and rivers; (49) they melted or profaned the consecrated vessels, and the ruins of shrines and altars were stained with the blood of the faithful.
 <NORP>Buccelin</NORP> was actuated by ambition, and <PERSON>Lothaire</PERSON> by avarice.
 The former aspired to restore the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kingdom; the latter, after a promise to his brother of speedy succors, returned by the same road to deposit his treasure beyond the Alps.
 The strength of their armies was already wasted by the change of climate and contagion of disease: the <NORP>Germans</NORP> revelled in the vintage of Italy; and their own intemperance avenged, in some degree, the miseries of a defenceless people.
 Defeat of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and <NORP>Alamanni</NORP> by Narses, A.
D.
 554.
 At the entrance of the spring, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops, who had guarded the cities, assembled, to the number of eighteen <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men, in the neighborhood of Rome.
 Their <DATE>winter</DATE> hours had not been consumed in idleness.
 By the command, and after the example, of Narses, they repeated each day their military exercise on foot and on horseback, accustomed their ear to obey the sound of the trumpet, and practised the steps and evolutions of the <NORP>Pyrrhic</NORP> dance.
 From the Straits of Sicily, Buccelin, with thirty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alamanni, slowly moved towards Capua, occupied with a wooden tower the bridge of Casilinum, covered his right by the stream of the Vulturnus, and secured the rest of his encampment by a rampart of sharp stakes, and a circle of wagons, whose wheels were buried in the earth.
 He impatiently expected the return of Lothaire; ignorant, alas! that his brother could never return, and that the chief and his army had been swept away by a strange disease (50) on the banks of the Lake Benacus, between <GPE>Trent</GPE> and Verona.
 The banners of <NORP>Narses</NORP> soon approached the Vulturnus, and the eyes of <GPE>Italy</GPE> were anxiously fixed on the event of this final contest.
 Perhaps the talents of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general were most conspicuous in the calm operations which precede the tumult of a battle.
 His skilful movements intercepted the subsistence of the Barbarian, deprived him of the advantage of the bridge and river, and in the choice of the ground and moment of action reduced him to comply with the inclination of his enemy.
 On the morning of the important day, when the ranks were already formed, a servant, for some trivial fault, was killed by his master, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the leaders of the Heruli.
 The justice or passion of <NORP>Narses</NORP> was awakened: he summoned the offender to his presence, and without listening to his excuses, gave the signal to the minister of death.
 If the cruel master had not infringed the laws of his nation, this arbitrary execution was not less unjust than it appears to have been imprudent.
 The <PERSON>Heruli</PERSON> felt the indignity; they halted: but the <NORP>Roman</NORP> general, without soothing their rage, or expecting their resolution, called aloud, as the trumpets sounded, that unless they hastened to occupy their place, they would lose the honor of the victory.
 His troops were disposed (51) in a long front, the cavalry on the wings; in the centre, the heavy-armed foot; the archers and slingers in the rear.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> advanced in a sharp-pointed column, of the form of a triangle or solid wedge.
 They pierced the feeble centre of Narses, who received them with a smile into the fatal snare, and directed his wings of cavalry insensibly to wheel on their flanks and encompass their rear.
 The host of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and <NORP>Alamanni</NORP> consisted of infantry: a sword and buckler hung by their side; and they used, as their weapons of offence, a weighty hatchet and a hooked javelin, which were only formidable in close combat, or at a short distance.
 The flower of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> archers, on horseback, and in complete armor, skirmished without peril round this immovable phalanx; supplied by active speed the deficiency of number; and aimed their arrows against a crowd of Barbarians, who, instead of a cuirass and helmet, were covered by a loose garment of fur or linen.
 They paused, they trembled, their ranks were confounded, and in the decisive moment the Heruli, preferring glory to revenge, charged with rapid violence the head of the column.
 Their leader, Sinbal, and Aligern, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> prince, deserved the prize of superior valor; and their example excited the victorious troops to achieve with swords and spears the destruction of the enemy.
 Buccelin, and the greatest part of his army, perished on the field of battle, in the waters of the Vulturnus, or by the hands of the enraged peasants: but it may seem incredible, that a victory, (52) which no more than <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Alamanni</NORP> survived, could be purchased with the loss of fourscore Romans.
 Seven <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Goths, the relics of the war, defended the fortress of <GPE>Campsa</GPE> till the ensuing spring; and every messenger of <NORP>Narses</NORP> announced the reduction of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> cities, whose names were corrupted by the ignorance or vanity of the Greeks.
 (53) After the battle of Casilinum, <NORP>Narses</NORP> entered the capital; the arms and treasures of the Goths, the Franks, and the Alamanni, were displayed; his soldiers, with garlands in their hands, chanted the praises of the conqueror; and Rome, for the last time, beheld the semblance of a triumph.
 Settlement of Italy, A.
D.
 554-568.
 After a reign of <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> years, the throne of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kings was filled by the exarchs of Ravenna, the representatives in peace and war of the emperor of the Romans.
 Their jurisdiction was soon reduced to the limits of a narrow province: but <NORP>Narses</NORP> himself, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most powerful of the exarchs, administered above fifteen <DATE>years</DATE> the entire kingdom of Italy.
 Like Belisarius, he had deserved the honors of envy, calumny, and disgrace: but the favorite eunuch still enjoyed the confidence of Justinian; or the leader of a victorious army awed and repressed the ingratitude of a timid court.
 Yet it was not by weak and mischievous indulgence that <NORP>Narses</NORP> secured the attachment of his troops.
 Forgetful of the past, and regardless of the future, they abused the present hour of prosperity and peace.
 The cities of <GPE>Italy</GPE> resounded with the noise of drinking and dancing; the spoils of victory were wasted in sensual pleasures; and nothing (says Agathias) remained unless to exchange their shields and helmets for the soft lute and the capacious hogshead.
 (54) In a manly oration, not unworthy of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> censor, the eunuch reproved these disorderly vices, which sullied their fame, and endangered their safety.
 The soldiers blushed and obeyed; discipline was confirmed; the fortifications were restored; a duke was stationed for the defence and military command of each of the principal cities; (55) and the eye of <NORP>Narses</NORP> pervaded the ample prospect from <GPE>Calabria</GPE> to the Alps.
 The remains of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation evacuated the country, or mingled with the people; the Franks, instead of revenging the death of Buccelin, abandoned, without a struggle, their <NORP>Italian</NORP> conquests; and the rebellious Sinbal, chief of the Heruli, was subdued, taken and hung on a lofty gallows by the inflexible justice of the exarch.
 (56) The civil state of Italy, after the agitation of a long tempest, was fixed by a pragmatic sanction, which the emperor promulgated at the request of the pope.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> introduced his own jurisprudence into the schools and tribunals of the West; he ratified the acts of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> and his immediate successors, but every deed was rescinded and abolished which force had extorted, or fear had subscribed, under the usurpation of Totila.
 A moderate theory was framed to reconcile the rights of property with the safety of prescription, the claims of the state with the poverty of the people, and the pardon of offences with the interest of virtue and order of society.
 Under the exarchs of Ravenna, <GPE>Rome</GPE> was degraded to the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> rank.
 Yet the senators were gratified by the permission of visiting their estates in Italy, and of approaching, without obstacle, the throne of Constantinople: the regulation of weights and measures was delegated to the pope and senate; and the salaries of lawyers and physicians, of orators and grammarians, were destined to preserve, or rekindle, the light of science in the ancient capital.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> might dictate benevolent edicts, (57) and <NORP>Narses</NORP> might <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> his wishes by the restoration of cities, and more especially of churches.
 But the power of kings is most effectual to destroy; and the twenty <DATE>years</DATE> of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war had consummated the distress and depopulation of Italy.
 As early as the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> campaign, under the discipline of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> himself, <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> laborers died of hunger (58) in the narrow region of Picenum; (59) and a strict interpretation of the evidence of <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> would swell the loss of <GPE>Italy</GPE> above the total sum of her present inhabitants.
 (60) Invasion of the Bulgarians, A.
D.
 559.
 I desire to believe, but I dare not affirm, that <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> sincerely rejoiced in the triumph of Narses.
 Yet the consciousness of his own exploits might teach him to esteem without jealousy the merit of a rival; and the repose of the aged warrior was crowned by a last victory, which saved the emperor and the capital.
 The Barbarians, who annually visited the provinces of Europe, were less discouraged by some accidental defeats, than they were excited by the double hope of spoil and of subsidy.
 In the thirty-second <DATE>winter</DATE> of Justinian's reign, the <LOC>Danube</LOC> was deeply frozen: <PERSON>Zabergan</PERSON> led the cavalry of the Bulgarians, and his standard was followed by a promiscuous multitude of Sclavonians.
 The savage chief passed, without opposition, the river and the mountains, spread his troops over <GPE>Macedonia</GPE> and Thrace, and advanced with no more than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse to the long wall, which should have defended the territory of Constantinople.
 But the works of man are impotent against the assaults of nature: a recent earthquake had shaken the foundations of the wall; and the forces of the empire were employed on the distant frontiers of Italy, Africa, and Persia.
 The <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> schools, (61) or companies of the guards or domestic troops, had been augmented to the number of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred men, whose ordinary station was in the peaceful cities of Asia.
 But the places of the brave <NORP>Armenians</NORP> were insensibly supplied by lazy citizens, who purchased an exemption from the duties of civil life, without being exposed to the dangers of military service.
 Of such soldiers, few could be tempted to sally from the gates; and none could be persuaded to remain in the field, unless they wanted strength and speed to escape from the Bulgarians.
 The report of the fugitives exaggerated the numbers and fierceness of an enemy, who had polluted holy virgins, and abandoned new-born infants to the dogs and vultures; a crowd of rustics, imploring food and protection, increased the consternation of the city, and the tents of <PERSON>Zabergan</PERSON> were pitched at the distance of twenty miles, (62) on the banks of a small river, which encircles Melanthias, and afterwards falls into the Propontis.
 (63) <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> trembled: and those who had only seen the emperor in his old age, were pleased to suppose, that he had lost the alacrity and vigor of his youth.
 By his command the vessels of gold and silver were removed from the churches in the neighborhood, and even the suburbs, of Constantinople; the ramparts were lined with trembling spectators; the golden gate was crowded with useless generals and tribunes, and the senate shared the fatigues and the apprehensions of the populace.
 Last victory of Belisarius.
 But the eyes of the prince and people were directed to a feeble veteran, who was compelled by the public danger to resume the armor in which he had entered <GPE>Carthage</GPE> and defended Rome.
 The horses of the royal stables, of private citizens, and even of the circus, were hastily collected; the emulation of the old and young was roused by the name of Belisarius, and his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> encampment was in the presence of a victorious enemy.
 His prudence, and the labor of the friendly peasants, secured, with a ditch and rampart, the repose of the night; innumerable fires, and clouds of dust, were artfully contrived to magnify the opinion of his strength; his soldiers suddenly passed from despondency to presumption; and, while ten <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> voices demanded the battle, <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> dissembled his knowledge, that in the hour of trial he must depend on the firmness of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred veterans.
 The next morning the <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> cavalry advanced to the charge.
 But they heard the shouts of multitudes, they beheld the arms and discipline of the front; they were assaulted on the flanks by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ambuscades which rose from the woods; their foremost warriors fell by the hand of the aged hero and his gnards; and the swiftness of their evolutions was rendered useless by the close attack and rapid pursuit of the Romans.
 In this action (so speedy was their flight) the <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> lost only four hundred horse; but <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was saved; and Zabergan, who felt the hand of a master, withdrew to a respectful distance.
 But his friends were numerous in the councils of the emperor, and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> obeyed with reluctance the commands of envy and Justinian, which forbade him to achieve the deliverance of his country.
 On his return to the city, the people, still conscious of their danger, accompanied his triumph with acclamations of joy and gratitude, which were imputed as a crime to the victorious general.
 But when he entered the palace, the courtiers were silent, and the emperor, after a cold and thankless embrace, dismissed him to mingle with the train of slaves.
 Yet so deep was the impression of his glory on the minds of men, that Justinian, in the seventy-seventh year of his age, was encouraged to advance near forty miles from the capital, and to inspect in person the restoration of the long wall.
 The <NORP>Bulgarians</NORP> wasted the summer in the plains of Thrace; but they were inclined to peace by the failure of their rash attempts on <GPE>Greece</GPE> and the Chersonesus.
 A menace of killing their prisoners quickened the payment of heavy ransoms; and the departure of <PERSON>Zabergan</PERSON> was hastened by the report, that double-prowed vessels were built on the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to intercept his passage.
 The danger was soon forgotten; and a vain question, whether their sovereign had shown more wisdom or weakness, amused the idleness of the city.
 (64) His disgrace and death, A.
D.
 561.
 About <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> after the last victory of Belisarius, the emperor returned from a <NORP>Thracian</NORP> journey of health, or business, or devotion.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was afflicted by a pain in his head; and his private entry countenanced the rumor of his death.
 Before the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> hour of the day, the bakers' shops were plundered of their bread, the houses were shut, and every citizen, with hope or terror, prepared for the impending tumult.
 The senators themselves, fearful and suspicious, were convened at the ninth hour; and the praefect received their commands to visit every <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the city, and proclaim a general illumination for the recovery of the emperor's health.
 The ferment subsided; but every accident betrayed the impotence of the government, and the factious temper of the people: the guards were disposed to mutiny as often as their quarters were changed, or their pay was withheld: the frequent calamities of fires and earthquakes afforded the opportunities of disorder; the disputes of the blues and greens, of the orthodox and heretics, degenerated into bloody battles; and, in the presence of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> ambassador, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> blushed for himself and for his subjects.
 Capricious pardon and arbitrary punishment imbittered the irksomeness and discontent of a long reign: a conspiracy was formed in the palace; and, unless we are deceived by the names of <PERSON>Marcellus</PERSON> and Sergius, the most virtuous and the most profligate of the courtiers were associated in the same designs.
 They had fixed the time of the execution; their rank gave them access to the royal banquet; and their black slaves (65) were stationed in the vestibule and porticos, to announce the death of the tyrant, and to excite a sedition in the capital.
 But the indiscretion of an accomplice saved the poor remnant of the days of Justinian.
 The conspirators were detected and seized, with daggers hidden under their garments: <PERSON>Marcellus</PERSON> died by his own hand, and <PERSON>Sergius</PERSON> was dragged from the sanctuary.
 (66) Pressed by remorse, or tempted by the hopes of safety, he accused <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> officers of the household of Belisarius; and torture forced them to declare that they had acted according to the secret instructions of their patron.
 (67) Posterity will not hastily believe that a hero who, in the vigor of life, had disdained the fairest offers of ambition and revenge, should stoop to the murder of his prince, whom he could not long expect to survive.
 His followers were impatient to fly; A.
D.
 563, December 5.
 but flight must have been supported by rebellion, and he had lived enough for nature and for glory.
 <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> appeared before the council with less fear than indignation: after forty years' service, the emperor had prejudged his guilt; and injustice was sanctified by the presence and authority of the patriarch.
 The life of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> was graciously spared; but his fortunes were sequestered, and, from December to July, A.
D.
 564, <DATE>July</DATE> 19.
 he was guarded as a prisoner in his own palace.
 At length his innocence was acknowledged; his freedom and honor were restored; and death, which might be hastened by resentment and grief, removed him from the world in about eight months after his deliverance.
 A.
D.
 565, <DATE>March</DATE> 13.
 The name of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> can never die but instead of the funeral, the monuments, the statues, so justly due to his memory, I only read, that his treasures, the spoil of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Vandals, were immediately confiscated by the emperor.
 Some decent portion was reserved, however for the use of his widow: and as <PERSON>Antonina</PERSON> had much to repent, she devoted the last remains of her life and fortune to the foundation of a convent.
 Such is the simple and genuine narrative of the fall of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> and the ingratitude of Justinian.
 (68) That he was deprived of his eyes, and reduced by envy to beg his bread, "Give a penny to <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> the general!" is a fiction of later times, (69) which has obtained credit, or rather favor, as a strange example of the vicissitudes of fortune.
 (70) Death and character of Justinian, A.
D.
 565, Nov.
 14.
 If the emperor could rejoice in the death of Belisarius, he enjoyed the base satisfaction only eight months, the last period of a reign of thirty- eight years, and a life of eighty-three years.
 It would be difficult to trace the character of a prince who is not the most conspicuous object of his own times: but the confessions of an enemy may be received as the safest evidence of his virtues.
 The resemblance of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> to the bust of Domitian, is maliciously urged; (71) with the acknowledgment, however, of a well-proportioned figure, a ruddy complexion, and a pleasing countenance.
 The emperor was easy of access, patient of hearing, courteous and affable in discourse, and a master of the angry passions which rage with such destructive violence in the breast of a despot.
 <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> praises his temper, to reproach him with calm and deliberate cruelty: but in the conspiracies which attacked his authority and person, a more candid judge will approve the justice, or admire the clemency, of Justinian.
 He excelled in the private virtues of chastity and temperance: but the impartial love of beauty would have been less mischievous than his conjugal tenderness for Theodora; and his abstemious diet was regulated, not by the prudence of a philosopher, but the superstition of a monk.
 His repasts were short and frugal: on solemn fasts, he contented himself with water and vegetables; and such was his strength, as well as fervour, that he frequently passed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days, and as many nights, without tasting any food.
 The measure of his sleep was not less rigorous: after the repose of a single hour, the body was awakened by the soul, and, to the astonishment of his chamberlain, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> walked or studied till the morning light.
 Such restless application prolonged his time for the acquisition of knowledge (72) and the despatch of business; and he might seriously deserve the reproach of confounding, by minute and preposterous diligence, the general order of his administration.
 The emperor professed himself a musician and architect, a poet and philosopher, a lawyer and theologian; and if he failed in the enterprise of reconciling the <NORP>Christian</NORP> sects, the review of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence is a noble monument of his spirit and industry.
 In the government of the empire, he was less wise, or less successful: the age was unfortunate; the people was oppressed and discontented; <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> abused her power; a succession of bad ministers disgraced his judgment; and <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was neither beloved in his life, nor regretted at his death.
 The love of fame was deeply implanted in his breast, but he condescended to the poor ambition of titles, honors, and contemporary praise; and while he labored to fix the admiration, he forfeited the esteem and affection, of the Romans.
 The design of the <NORP>African</NORP> and <NORP>Italian</NORP> wars was boldly conceived and executed; and his penetration discovered the talents of <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> in the camp, of <NORP>Narses</NORP> in the palace.
 But the name of the emperor is eclipsed by the names of his victorious generals; and <PERSON>Belisarius</PERSON> still lives, to upbraid the envy and ingratitude of his sovereign.
 The partial favor of mankind applauds the genius of a conqueror, who leads and directs his subjects in the exercise of arms.
 The characters of <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> and of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> are distinguished by the cold ambition which delights in war, and declines the dangers of the field.
 Yet a colossal statue of bronze represented the emperor on horseback, preparing to march against the <NORP>Persians</NORP> in the habit and armor of Achilles.
 In the great square before the church of St.
 Sophia, this monument was raised on a brass column and a stone pedestal of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> steps; and the pillar of Theodosius, which weighed <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> four hundred pounds of silver, was removed from the same place by the avarice and vanity of Justinian.
 Future princes were more just or indulgent to his memory; the elder Andronicus, in the beginning of the fourteenth century, repaired and beautified his equestrian statue: since the fall of the empire it has been melted into cannon by the victorious Turks.
 (73) I shall conclude this chapter with the comets, the earthquakes, and the plague, which astonished or afflicted the age of Justinian.
 Comets, A.
D.
 531, 539.
 I.
 In the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> year of his reign, and in the month of September, a comet (74) was seen during twenty days in the western <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> of the heavens, and which shot its rays into the north.
 Eight <DATE>years</DATE> afterwards, while the sun was in Capricorn, another comet appeared to follow in the Sagittary; the size was gradually increasing; the head was in the east, the tail in the west, and it remained visible above forty days.
 The nations, who gazed with astonishment, expected wars and calamities from their baleful influence; and these expectations were abundantly fulfilled.
 The astronomers dissembled their ignorance of the nature of these blazing stars, which they affected to represent as the floating meteors of the air; and few among them embraced the simple notion of <PERSON>Seneca</PERSON> and the Chaldeans, that they are only planets of a longer period and more eccentric motion.
 (75) Time and science have justified the conjectures and predictions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> sage: the telescope has opened new worlds to the eyes of astronomers; (76) and, in the narrow space of history and fable, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> and the same comet is already found to have revisited the earth in <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> equal revolutions of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred and seventy-five years.
 The first, (77) which ascends beyond the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aera <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty-seven years, is coeval with Ogyges, the father of <NORP>Grecian</NORP> antiquity.
 And this appearance explains the tradition which <PERSON>Varro</PERSON> has preserved, that under his reign the planet <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> changed her color, size, figure, and course; a prodigy without example either in past or succeeding ages.
 (78) The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> visit, in the year <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> hundred and ninety-three, is darkly implied in the fable of Electra, the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> of the Pleiads, who have been reduced to <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> since the time of the Trojan war.
 That nymph, the wife of Dardanus, was unable to support the ruin of her country: she abandoned the dances of her sister orbs, fled from the zodiac to the north pole, and obtained, from her dishevelled locks, the name of the comet.
 The <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> period expires in the year <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred and eighteen, a date that exactly agrees with the tremendous comet of the Sibyl, and perhaps of Pliny, which arose in the <LOC>West</LOC> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generations before the reign of Cyrus.
 The <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> apparition, forty-four <DATE>years</DATE> before the birth of Christ, is of all others the most splendid and important.
 After the death of Caesar, a long-haired star was conspicuous to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and to the nations, during the games which were exhibited by young <PERSON>Octavian</PERSON> in honor of <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and his uncle.
 The vulgar opinion, that it conveyed to heaven the divine soul of the dictator, was cherished and consecrated by the piety of a statesman; while his secret superstition referred the comet to the glory of his own times.
 (79) The <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> visit has been already ascribed to the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> year of Justinian, which coincides with the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred and thirty-first of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aera.
 And it may deserve notice, that in this, as in the preceding instance, the comet was followed, though at a longer interval, by a remarkable paleness of the sun.
 The <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> return, in the year <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> hundred and six, is recorded by the chronicles of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and China: and in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fervor of the crusades, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> and the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> might surmise, with equal reason, that it portended the destruction of the Infidels.
 The <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> phenomenon, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred and eighty, was presented to the eyes of an enlightened age.
 (80) The philosophy of <PERSON>Bayle</PERSON> dispelled a prejudice which Milton's muse had so recently adorned, that the comet, "from its horrid hair shakes pestilence and war.
" (81) Its road in the heavens was observed with exquisite skill by <PERSON>Flamstead</PERSON> and Cassini: and the mathematical science of Bernoulli, <PERSON>Newton</PERSON> , and Halley, investigated the laws of its revolutions.
 At the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> period, in the year <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred and fifty-five, their calculations may perhaps be verified by the astronomers of some future capital in the <NORP>Siberian</NORP> or <NORP>American</NORP> wilderness.
 Earthquakes.
 II.
 The near approach of a comet may injure or destroy the globe which we inhabit; but the changes on its surface have been hitherto produced by the action of volcanoes and earthquakes.
 (82) The nature of the soil may indicate the countries most exposed to these formidable concussions, since they are caused by subterraneous fires, and such fires are kindled by the union and fermentation of iron and sulphur.
 But their times and effects appear to lie beyond the reach of human curiosity; and the philosopher will discreetly abstain from the prediction of earthquakes, till he has counted the drops of water that silently filtrate on the inflammable mineral, and measured the caverns which increase by resistance the explosion of the imprisoned air.
 Without assigning the cause, history will distinguish the periods in which these calamitous events have been rare or frequent, and will observe, that this fever of the earth raged with uncommon violence during the reign of Justinian.
 (83) Each year is marked by the repetition of earthquakes, of such duration, that <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> has been shaken above forty days; of such extent, that the shock has been communicated to the whole surface of the globe, or at least of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 An impulsive or vibratory motion was felt: enormous chasms were opened, huge and heavy bodies were discharged into the air, the sea alternately advanced and retreated beyond its ordinary bounds, and a mountain was torn from Libanus, (84) and cast into the waves, where it protected, as a mole, the new harbor of <PRODUCT>Botrys</PRODUCT> (85) in Phoenicia.
 The stroke that agitates an ant-hill may crush the insect-myriads in the dust; yet truth must extort confession that man has industriously laboured for his own destruction.
 The institution of great cities, which include a nation within the limits of a wall, almost realizes the wish of Caligula, that the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people had but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> neck.

Two hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> persons are said to have perished in the earthquake of Antioch, whose domestic multitudes were swelled by the conflux of strangers to the festival of the Ascension.

 551, <DATE>July</DATE> 9.
The loss of <GPE>Berytus</GPE> (86) was of smaller account, but of much greater value.
 That city, on the coast of Phoenicia, was illustrated by the study of the civil law, which opened the surest road to wealth and dignity: the schools of <GPE>Berytus</GPE> were filled with the rising spirits of the age, and many a youth was lost in the earthquake, who might have lived to be the scourge or the guardian of his country.
 In these disasters, the architect becomes the enemy of mankind.
 The hut of a savage, or the tent of an Arab, may be thrown down without injury to the inhabitant; and the <NORP>Peruvians</NORP> had reason to deride the folly of their <NORP>Spanish</NORP> conquerors, who with so much cost and labour erected their own sepulchres.
 The rich marbles of a patrician are dashed on his own head: a whole people is buried under the ruins of public and private edifices, and the conflagration is kindled and propagated by the innumerable fires which are necessary for the subsistence and manufactures of a great city.
 Instead of the mutual sympathy which might comfort and assist the distressed, they dreadfully experience the vices and passions which are released from the fear of punishment: the tottering houses are pillaged by intrepid avarice; revenge embraces the moment, and selects the victim; and the earth often swallows the assassin, or the ravisher, in the consummation of their crimes.
 Superstition involves the present danger with invisible terrors; and if the image of death may sometimes be subservient to the virtue or repentance of individuals, an affrighted people is more forcibly moved to expect the end of the world, or to deprecate with servile homage the wrath of an avenging Deity.
 Plague its origins and nature, A.
D.
 542.
 III.
 <GPE>Aethiopia</GPE> and <GPE>Egypt</GPE> have been stigmatized, in every age, as the original source and seminary of the plague.
 (87) In a damp, hot, stagnating air, this <NORP>African</NORP> fever is generated from the putrefaction of animal substances, and especially from the swarms of locusts, not less destructive to mankind in their death than in their lives.
 The fatal disease which depopulated the earth in the time of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and his successors, (88) <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> appeared in the neighborhood of Pelusium, between the <LOC>Serbonian</LOC> bog and the eastern channel of the Nile.
 From thence, tracing as it were a double path, it spread to the East, over Syria, Persia, and the Indies, and penetrated to the West, along the coast of Africa, and over the continent of Europe.
 In the spring of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> year, Constantinople, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> or four months, was visited by the pestilence; and Procopius, who observed its progress and symptoms with the eyes of a physician, (89) has emulated the skill and diligence of <PERSON>Thucydides</PERSON> in the description of the plague of Athens.
 (90) The infection was sometimes announced by the visions of a distempered fancy, and the victim despaired as soon as he had heard the menace and felt the stroke of an invisible spectre.
 But the greater number, in their beds, in the streets, in their usual occupation, were surprised by a slight fever; so slight, indeed, that neither the pulse nor the color of the patient gave any signs of the approaching danger.
 The same, the next, or the succeeding day, it was declared by the swelling of the glands, particularly those of the groin, of the armpits, and under the ear; and when these buboes or tumors were opened, they were found to contain a coal, or black substance, of the size of a lentil.
 If they came to a just swelling and suppuration, the patient was saved by this kind and natural discharge of the morbid humor.
 But if they continued hard and dry, a mortification quickly ensued, and the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> day was commonly the term of his life.
 The fever was often accompanied with lethargy or delirium; the bodies of the sick were covered with black pustules or carbuncles, the symptoms of immediate death; and in the constitutions too feeble to produce an irruption, the vomiting of blood was followed by a mortification of the bowels.
 To pregnant women the plague was generally mortal: yet <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> infant was drawn alive from his dead mother, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> mothers survived the loss of their infected foetus.
 Youth was the most perilous season; and the female sex was less susceptible than the male: but every rank and profession was attacked with indiscriminate rage, and many of those who escaped were deprived of the use of their speech, without being secure from a return of the disorder.
 (91) The physicians of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> were zealous and skilful; but their art was baffled by the various symptoms and pertinacious vehemence of the disease: the same remedies were productive of contrary effects, and the event capriciously disappointed their prognostics of death or recovery.
 The order of funerals, and the right of sepulchres, were confounded: those who were left without friends or servants, lay unburied in the streets, or in their desolate houses; and a magistrate was authorized to collect the promiscuous heaps of dead bodies, to transport them by land or water, and to inter them in deep pits beyond the precincts of the city.
 Their own danger, and the prospect of public distress, awakened some remorse in the minds of the most vicious of mankind: the confidence of health again revived their passions and habits; but philosophy must disdain the observation of Procopius, that the lives of such men were guarded by the peculiar favor of fortune or Providence.
 He forgot, or perhaps he secretly recollected, that the plague had touched the person of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> himself; but the abstemious diet of the emperor may suggest, as in the case of Socrates, a more rational and honorable cause for his recovery.
 (92) During his sickness, the public consternation was expressed in the habits of the citizens; and their idleness and despondence occasioned a general scarcity in the capital of the East.
 Extent and duration, A.
D.
 542-594.
 Contagion is the inseparable symptom of the plague; which, by mutual respiration, is transfused from the infected persons to the lungs and stomach of those who approach them.
 While philosophers believe and tremble, it is singular, that the existence of a real danger should have been denied by a people most prone to vain and imaginary terrors.
 (93) Yet the fellow-citizens of <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> were satisfied, by some short and partial experience, that the infection could not be gained by the closest conversation: (94) and this persuasion might support the assiduity of friends or physicians in the care of the sick, whom inhuman prudence would have condemned to solitude and despair.
 But the fatal security, like the predestination of the Turks, must have aided the progress of the contagion; and those salutary precautions to which <LOC>Europe</LOC> is indebted for her safety, were unknown to the government of Justinian.
 No restraints were imposed on the free and frequent intercourse of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces: from <GPE>Persia</GPE> to France, the nations were mingled and infected by wars and emigrations; and the pestilential odor which lurks for <DATE>years</DATE> in a bale of cotton was imported, by the abuse of trade, into the most distant regions.
 The mode of its propagation is explained by the remark of <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> himself, that it always spread from the sea-coast to the inland country: the most sequestered islands and mountains were successively visited; the places which had escaped the fury of its <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> passage were alone exposed to the contagion of the ensuing year.
 The winds might diffuse that subtile venom; but unless the atmosphere be previously disposed for its reception, the plague would soon expire in the cold or temperate climates of the earth.
 Such was the universal corruption of the air, that the pestilence which burst forth in the fifteenth year of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was not checked or alleviated by any difference of the seasons.
 In time, its <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> malignity was abated and dispersed; the disease alternately languished and revived; but it was not till the end of a calamitous period of fifty-two years, that mankind recovered their health, or the air resumed its pure and salubrious quality.
 No facts have been preserved to sustain an account, or even a conjecture, of the numbers that perished in this extraordinary mortality.
 I only find, that during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months, five, and at length ten, <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> persons died each day at Constantinople; that many cities of the <LOC>East</LOC> were left vacant, and that in several districts of <GPE>Italy</GPE> the harvest and the vintage withered on the ground.
 The triple scourge of war, pestilence, and famine, afflicted the subjects of Justinian; and his reign is disgraced by the visible decrease of the human species, which has never been repaired in some of the fairest countries of the globe.
