Character of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> II.
 The siege of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> attracts our <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attention to the person and character of the great destroyer.
 <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> (1) was the son of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Amurath; and though his mother has been decorated with the titles of <NORP>Christian</NORP> and princess, she is more probably confounded with the numerous concubines who peopled from every climate the harem of the sultan.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> education and sentiments were those of a devout Mussulman; and as often as he conversed with an infidel, he purified his hands and face by the legal rites of ablution.
 Age and empire appear to have relaxed this narrow bigotry: his aspiring genius disdained to acknowledge a power above his own; and in his looser hours he presumed (it is said) to brand the prophet of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> as a robber and impostor.
 Yet the sultan persevered in a decent reverence for the doctrine and discipline of the Koran: (2) his private indiscretion must have been sacred from the vulgar ear; and we should suspect the credulity of strangers and sectaries, so prone to believe that a mind which is hardened against truth must be armed with superior contempt for absurdity and error.
 Under the tuition of the most skilful masters, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> advanced with an early and rapid progress in the paths of knowledge; and besides his native tongue it is affirmed that he spoke or understood <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> languages, (3) the Arabic, the Persian, the <NORP>Chaldaean</NORP> or Hebrew, the Latin, and the Greek.
 The <NORP>Persian</NORP> might indeed contribute to his amusement, and the <LANGUAGE>Arabic</LANGUAGE> to his edification; and such studies are familiar to the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> youth.
 In the intercourse of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Turks, a conqueror might wish to converse with the people over which he was ambitious to reign: his own praises in <NORP>Latin</NORP> poetry (4) or prose (5) might find a passage to the royal ear; but what use or merit could recommend to the statesman or the scholar the uncouth dialect of his <LANGUAGE>Hebrew</LANGUAGE> slaves? The history and geography of the world were familiar to his memory: the lives of the heroes of the East, perhaps of the West, (6) excited his emulation: his skill in astrology is excused by the folly of the times, and supposes some rudiments of mathematical science; and a profane taste for the arts is betrayed in his liberal invitation and reward of the painters of Italy.
 (7) But the influence of religion and learning were employed without effect on his savage and licentious nature.
 I will not transcribe, nor do I firmly believe, the stories of his <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> pages, whose bellies were ripped open in search of a stolen melon; or of the beauteous slave, whose head he severed from her body, to convince the <PERSON>Janizaries</PERSON> that their master was not the votary of love.
 His sobriety is attested by the silence of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> annals, which accuse three, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> only, of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> line of the vice of drunkenness.
 (8) But it cannot be denied that his passions were at once furious and inexorable; that in the palace, as in the field, a torrent of blood was spilt on the slightest provocation; and that the noblest of the captive youth were often dishonoured by his unnatural lust.
 In the Albanian war he studied the lessons, and soon surpassed the example, of his father; and the conquest of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> kingdoms, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> cities, a vain and flattering account, is ascribed to his invincible sword.
 He was doubtless a soldier, and possibly a general; <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> has sealed his glory; but if we compare the means, the obstacles, and the achievements, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> must blush to sustain a parallel with <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or Timour.
 Under his command, the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> forces were always more numerous than their enemies; yet their progress was bounded by the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> and the Adriatic; and his arms were checked by <NORP>Huniades</NORP> and Scanderbeg, by the <NORP>Rhodian</NORP> knights and by the <NORP>Persian</NORP> king.
 His reign, A.
D.
 1451,February 9- 1481,July 2.
 In the reign of Amurath, he twice tasted of royalty, and twice descended from the throne: his tender age was incapable of opposing his father's restoration, but never could he forgive the viziers who had recommended that salutary measure.
 His nuptials were celebrated with the daughter of a <NORP>Turkman</NORP> emir; and, after a festival of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months, he departed from <PERSON>Adrianople</PERSON> with his bride, to reside in the government of Magnesia.
 Before the end of six weeks, he was recalled by a sudden message from the divan, which announced the decease of Amurath, and the mutinous spirit of the Janizaries.
 His speed and vigour commanded their obedience: he passed the <PRODUCT>Hellespont</PRODUCT> with a chosen guard: and at the distance of a mile from Adrianople, the viziers and emirs, the imams and cadhis, the soldiers and the people, fell prostrate before the new sultan.
 They affected to weep, they affected to rejoice: he ascended the throne at the age of twenty-one years, and removed the cause of sedition by the death, the inevitable death, of his infant brothers.
 (9) The ambassadors of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> soon appeared to congratulate his accession and solicit his friendship; and to all he spoke the language of moderation and peace.
 The confidence of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was revived by the solemn oaths and fair assurances with which he sealed the ratification of the treaty: and a rich domain on the banks of the <PERSON>Strymon</PERSON> was assigned for the <DATE>annual</DATE> payment of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand aspers, the pension of an <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> prince, who was detained at his request in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 Yet the neighbours of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> might tremble at the severity with which a youthful monarch reformed the pomp of his father's household: the expenses of luxury were applied to those of ambition, and a useless train of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand falconers was either dismissed from his service, or enlisted in his troops.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <DATE>summer</DATE> of his reign, he visited with an army the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> provinces; but after humbling the pride, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> accepted the submission, of the Caramanian, that he might not be diverted by the smallest obstacle from the execution of his great design.
 (10) Hostile intentions of Mahomet, A.
D.
 1451.
 The Mahometan, and more especially the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> casuists, have pronounced that no promise can bind the faithful against the interest and duty of their religion; and that the sultan may abrogate his own treaties and those of his predecessors.
 The justice and magnanimity of <GPE>Amurath</GPE> had scorned this immoral privilege; but his son, though the proudest of men, could stoop from ambition to the basest arts of dissimulation and deceit.
 Peace was on his lips, while war was in his heart: he incessantly sighed for the possession of Constantinople; and the Greeks, by their own indiscretion, afforded the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> pretence of the fatal rupture.
 (11) Instead of laboring to be forgotten, their ambassadors pursued his camp, to demand the payment, and even the increase, of their <DATE>annual</DATE> stipend: the divan was importuned by their complaints, and the vizier, a secret friend of the Christians, was constrained to deliver the sense of his brethren.
 But if the fears of the ambassadors were alarmed by the stern language of the vizier, they were soothed by the courteous audience and friendly speeches of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> prince; and <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> assured them that on his return to <PERSON>Adrianople</PERSON> he would redress the grievances, and consult the true interests, of the Greeks.
 No sooner had he repassed the Hellespont, than he issued a mandate to suppress their pension, and to expel their officers from the banks of the Strymon: in this measure he betrayed a hostile mind; and the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> order announced, and in some degree commenced, the siege of Constantinople.
 In the narrow pass of the Bosphorus, an <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> fortress had formerly been raised by his grandfather; in the opposite situation, on the <NORP>European</NORP> side, he resolved to erect a more formidable castle; and a thousand masons were commanded to assemble in the spring on a spot named Asomaton, about <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> miles from the <NORP>Greek</NORP> metropolis.
 (12) Persuasion is the resource of the feeble; and the feeble can seldom persuade: the ambassadors of the emperor attempted, without success, to divert <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> from the execution of his design.
 They represented, that his grandfather had solicited the permission of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> to build a castle on his own territories; but that this double fortification, which would command the strait, could only tend to violate the alliance of the nations; to intercept the <NORP>Latins</NORP> who traded in the Black Sea, and perhaps to annihilate the subsistence of the city.
 After this declaration, Constantine, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> in spirit as in rank, (14) had determined to unsheathe the sword, and to resist the approach and establishment of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> on the Bosphorus.
 He was disarmed by the advice of his civil and ecclesiastical ministers, who recommended a system less generous, and even less prudent, than his own, to approve their patience and long-suffering, to brand the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> with the name and guilt of an aggressor, and to depend on chance and time for their own safety, and the destruction of a fort which could not long be maintained in the neighbourhood of a great and populous city.
 Amidst hope and fear, the fears of the wise, and the hopes of the credulous, the <DATE>winter</DATE> rolled away; the proper business of each man, and each hour, was postponed; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> shut their eyes against the impending danger, till the arrival of the spring and the sultan decide the assurance of their ruin.
 He builds a fortress on the Bosphorus, A.
D.
 1452, March.
 Of a master who never forgives, the orders are seldom disobeyed.
 On the twenty-sixth of March, the appointed spot of <GPE>Asomaton</GPE> was covered with an active swarm of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> artificers; and the materials by sea and land were diligently transported from <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia.
 (15) The lime had been burnt in Cataphrygia; the timber was cut down in the woods of <GPE>Heraclea</GPE> and Nicomedia; and the stones were dug from the <NORP>Anatolian</NORP> quarries.
 Each of the thousand masons was assisted by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> workmen; and a measure of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> cubits was marked for their daily task.
 The fortress (16) was built in a triangular form; each angle was flanked by a strong and massy tower; <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> on the declivity of the hill, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> along the sea-shore: a thickness of twenty-two feet was assigned for the walls, <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> for the towers; and the whole building was covered with a solid platform of lead.
 <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> himself pressed and directed the work with indefatigable ardour: his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> viziers claimed the honour of finishing their respective towers; the zeal of the cadhis emulated that of the Janizaries; the meanest labor was ennobled by the service of God and the sultan; and the diligence of the multitude was quickened by the eye of a despot, whose smile was the hope of fortune, and whose frown was the messenger of death.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor beheld with terror the irresistible progress of the work; and vainly strove, by flattery and gifts, to assuage an implacable foe, who sought, and secretly fomented, the slightest occasion of a quarrel.
 Such occasions must soon and inevitably be found.
 The ruins of stately churches, and even the marble columns which had been consecrated to Saint Michael the archangel, were employed without scruple by the profane and rapacious Moslems; and some Christians, who presumed to oppose the removal, received from their hands the crown of martyrdom.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had solicited a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> guard to protect the fields and harvests of his subjects: the guard was fixed; but their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> order was to allow free pasture to the mules and horses of the camp, and to defend their brethren if they should be molested by the natives.
 The retinue of an <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> chief had left their horses to pass the night among the ripe corn; the damage was felt; the insult was resented; and several of both nations were slain in a tumultuous conflict.
 <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> listened with joy to the complaint; and a detachment was commanded to exterminate the guilty village: the guilty had fled; but <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> innocent and unsuspecting reapers were massacred by the soldiers.
 The <NORP>Turkish</NORP> war, June.
 Till this provocation, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had been opened to the visits of commerce and curiosity: on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> alarm, the gates were shut; but the emperor, still anxious for peace, released on the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day his <NORP>Turkish</NORP> captives; (17) and expressed, in a last message, the firm resignation of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> and a soldier.
 The sultan's answer was hostile and decisive: his fortifications were completed; and before his departure for <PERSON>Adrianople</PERSON> September 1;, he stationed a vigilant <PERSON>Aga</PERSON> and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Janizaries, to levy a tribute on the ships of every nation that should pass within the reach of their cannon.
 A <NORP>Venetian</NORP> vessel, refusing obedience to the new lords of the Bosphorus, was sunk with a single bullet.
 The master and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> sailors escaped in the boat; but they were dragged in chains to the Porte: the chief was impaled; his companions were beheaded; and the historian <PERSON>Ducas</PERSON> (18) beheld, at Demotica, their bodies exposed to the wild beasts.
 The siege of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was deferred till the ensuing spring; but an <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> army marched into the <NORP>Morea</NORP> to divert the force of the brothers of Constantine.

 At this aera of calamity, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these princes, the despot Thomas, was blessed or afflicted with the birth of a son; Preparations for the siege of Constantinople, A.
D.
 1452, September-1453,April.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the <NORP>Turks</NORP> passed an anxious and sleepless winter: the former were kept awake by their fears, the latter by their hopes; both by the preparations of defence and attack; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, who had the most to lose or to gain, were the most deeply affected by the national sentiment.
 In Mahomet, that sentiment was inflamed by the ardour of his youth and temper: he amused his leisure with building at <PERSON>Adrianople</PERSON> (20) the lofty palace of Jehan Numa, (the watchtower of the world;) but his serious thoughts were irrevocably bent on the conquest of the city of Caesar.
 At the dead of night, about the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> watch, he started from his bed, and commanded the instant attendance of his prime vizier.
 The message, the hour, the prince, and his own situation, alarmed the guilty conscience of Calil Basha; who had possessed the confidence, and advised the restoration, of Amurath.
 On the accession of the son, the vizier was confirmed in his office and the appearances of favour; but the veteran statesman was not insensible that he trod on a thin and slippery ice, which might break under his footsteps, and plunge him in the abyss.
 His friendship for the Christians, which might be innocent under the late reign, had stigmatized him with the name of Gabour Ortachi, or foster-brother of the infidels; (21) and his avarice entertained a venal and treasonable correspondence, which was detected and punished after the conclusion of the war.
 On receiving the royal mandate, he embraced, perhaps for the last time, his wife and children; filled a cup with pieces of gold, hastened to the palace, adored the sultan, and offered, according to the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> custom, the slight tribute of his duty and gratitude.
 (22) As soon as the vizier had recovered from his surprise, To sound the disposition of his soldiers, he often wandered through the streets alone, and in disguise; and it was fatal to discover the sultan, when he wished to escape from the vulgar eye.
 His hours were spent in delineating the plan of the hostile city; in debating with his generals and engineers, on what spot he should erect his batteries; on which side he should assault the walls; where he should spring his mines; to what place he should apply his scaling-ladders: and the exercises of the day repeated and proved the lucubrations of the night.
 The great Cannon of Mahomet.
 Among the implements of destruction, he studied with peculiar care the recent and tremendous discovery of the Latins; and his artillery surpassed whatever had yet appeared in the world.
 A founder of cannon, a <NORP>Dane</NORP> or Hungarian, who had been almost starved in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> service, deserted to the Moslems, and was liberally entertained by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan.
 <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was satisfied with the answer to his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> question, which he eagerly pressed on the artist.
 On this assurance, a foundry was established at Adrianople: the metal was prepared; and at the end of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months, <ORG>Urban</ORG> produced a piece of brass ordnance of stupendous, and almost incredible magnitude; a measure of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> palms is assigned to the bore; and the stone bullet weighed above six <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds.
 (24) A vacant place before the new palace was chosen for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> experiment; but to prevent the sudden and mischievous effects of astonishment and fear, a proclamation was issued, that the cannon would be discharged the ensuing day.
 The explosion was felt or heard in a circuit of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> furlongs: the ball, by the force of gunpowder, was driven above a mile; and on the spot where it fell, it buried itself a fathom deep in the ground.
 For the conveyance of this destructive engine, a frame or carriage of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> wagons was linked together and drawn along by a team of <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> oxen: <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> men on both sides were stationed, to poise and support the rolling weight; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> workmen marched before to smooth the way and repair the bridges; and near <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months were employed in a laborious journey of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> miles.
 A lively philosopher (25) derides on this occasion the credulity of the Greeks, and observes, with much reason, that we should always distrust the exaggerations of a vanquished people.
 He calculates, that a ball, even o <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds, would require a charge of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> pounds of powder; and that the stroke would be feeble and impotent, since not a <ORDINAL>fifteenth</ORDINAL> part of the mass could be inflamed at the same moment.
 A stranger as I am to the art of destruction, I can discern that the modern improvements of artillery prefer the number of pieces to the weight of metal; the quickness of the fire to the sound, or even the consequence, of a single explosion.
 Yet I dare not reject the positive and unanimous evidence of contemporary writers; nor can it seem improbable, that the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> artists, in their rude and ambitious efforts, should have transgressed the standard of moderation.
 A <NORP>Turkish</NORP> cannon, more enormous than that of Mahomet, still guards the entrance of the Dardanelles; and if the use be inconvenient, it has been found on a late trial that the effect was far from contemptible.
 A stone bullet of eleven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds' weight was once discharged with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> pounds of powder: at the distance of six <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> yards it shivered into <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rocky fragments; traversed the strait; and leaving the waters in a foam, again rose and bounded against the opposite hill.
 (26) <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> II.
 forms the siege of Constantinople, A.
D.
 1453, <DATE>April</DATE> 6.
 While <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> threatened the capital of the East, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor implored with fervent prayers the assistance of earth and heaven.
 But the invisible powers were deaf to his supplications; and <GPE>Christendom</GPE> beheld with indifference the fall of Constantinople, while she derived at least some promise of supply from the jealous and temporal policy of the sultan of Egypt.
 Some states were too weak, and others too remote; by some the danger was considered as imaginary by others as inevitable: the <NORP>Western</NORP> princes were involved in their endless and domestic quarrels; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff was exasperated by the falsehood or obstinacy of the Greeks.
 Instead of employing in their favour the arms and treasures of Italy, <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> had foretold their approaching ruin; and his honour was engaged in the accomplishment of his prophecy.
 Perhaps he was softened by the last extremity o their distress; but his compassion was tardy; his efforts were faint and unavailing; and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had fallen, before the squadrons of <GPE>Genoa</GPE> and <GPE>Venice</GPE> could sail from their harbours.
 (27) Even the princes of the <NORP>Morea</NORP> and of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> islands affected a cold neutrality: the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> colony of <GPE>Galata</GPE> negotiated a private treaty; and the sultan indulged them in the delusive hope, that by his clemency they might survive the ruin of the empire.
 A plebeian crowd, and some <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> nobles basely withdrew from the danger of their country; and the avarice of the rich denied the emperor, and reserved for the Turks, the secret treasures which might have raised in their defence whole armies of mercenaries.
 (28) The indigent and solitary prince prepared, however, to sustain his formidable adversary; but if his courage were equal to the peril, his strength was inadequate to the contest.
 In the beginning of the spring, the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> vanguard swept the towns and villages as far as the gates of Constantinople: submission was spared and protected; whatever presumed to resist was exterminated with fire and sword.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> places on the Black Sea, Mesembria, Acheloum, and Bizon, surrendered on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> summons; <PERSON>Selybria</PERSON> alone deserved the honours of a siege or blockade; and the bold inhabitants, while they were invested by land, launched their boats, pillaged the opposite coast of Cyzicus, and sold their captives in the public market.
 But on the approach of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> himself all was silent and prostrate: he <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> halted at the distance of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> miles; and from thence advancing in battle array, planted before the gates of St.
 Romanus the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> standard; and on the sixth day of <DATE>April</DATE> formed the memorable siege of Constantinople.
 Forces of the Turks; The troops of <LOC>Asia</LOC> and <LOC>Europe</LOC> extended on the right and left from the <PRODUCT>Propontis</PRODUCT> to the harbour; the <PERSON>Janizaries</PERSON> in the front were stationed before the sultan's tent; the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> line was covered by a deep entrenchment; and a subordinate army enclosed the suburb of Galata, and watched the doubtful faith of the Genoese.
 The inquisitive Philelphus, who resided in <GPE>Greece</GPE> about <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> before the siege, is confident, that all the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> forces of any name or value could not exceed the number of <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> thousand horse and twenty thousand foot; and he upbraids the pusillanimity of the nations, who had tamely yielded to a handful of Barbarians.
 Such indeed might be the regular establishment of the Capiculi, (29) the troops of the <PERSON>Porte</PERSON> who marched with the prince, and were paid from his royal treasury.
 But the bashaws, in their respective governments, maintained or levied a provincial militia; many lands were held by a military tenure; many volunteers were attracted by the hope of spoil and the sound of the holy trumpet invited a swarm of hungry and fearless fanatics, who might contribute at least to multiply the terrors, and in a <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attack to blunt the swords, of the Christians.
 The whole mass of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> powers is magnified by Ducas, Chalcondyles, and Leonard of Chios, to the amount of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand men; but <PERSON>Phranza</PERSON> was a less remote and more accurate judge; and his precise definition of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty-eight thousand does not exceed the measure of experience and probability.
 (30) The navy of the besiegers was less formidable: the <PRODUCT>Propontis</PRODUCT> was overspread with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty sail; but of these no more than <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> could be rated as galleys of war; and the far greater part must be degraded to the condition of store-ships and transports, which poured into the camp fresh supplies of men, ammunition, and provisions.
 of the Greeks.
 In her last decay, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was still peopled with more than a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand inhabitants; but these numbers are found in the accounts, not of war, but of captivity; and they mostly consisted of mechanics, of priests, of women, and of men devoid of that spirit which even women have sometimes exerted for the common safety.
 I can suppose, I could almost excuse, the reluctance of subjects to serve on a distant frontier, at the will of a tyrant; but the man who dares not expose his life in the defence of his children and his property, has lost in society the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most active energies of nature.
 By the emperor's command, a particular inquiry had been made through the streets and houses, how many of the citizens, or even of the monks, were able and willing to bear arms for their country.
 The lists were entrusted to Phranza; (31) and, after a diligent addition, he informed his master, with grief and surprise, that the national defence was reduced to <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand nine <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and seventy Romans.
 Between <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and his faithful minister this comfortless secret was preserved; and a sufficient proportion of shields, cross-bows, and muskets, were distributed from the arsenal to the city bands.
 They derived some accession from a body of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand strangers, under the command of John Justiniani, a noble Genoese; a liberal donative was advanced to these auxiliaries; and a princely recompense, the Isle of Lemnos, was promised to the valour and victory of their chief.
 A strong chain was drawn across the mouth of the harbour: it was supported by some <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Italian</NORP> vessels of war and merchandise; and the ships of every <NORP>Christian</NORP> nation, that successively arrived from <GPE>Candia</GPE> and the Black Sea, were detained for the public service.
 Against the powers of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> empire, a city of the extent of thirteen, perhaps of sixteen, miles was defended by a scanty garrison of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> thousand soldiers.
 <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> were open to the besiegers; but the strength and provisions of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> must sustain a daily decrease; nor could they indulge the expectation of any foreign succour or supply.
 False union of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> churches, A.
D.
 1452, Dec.
 12.
 The primitive <NORP>Romans</NORP> would have drawn their swords in the resolution of death or conquest.
 The primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> might have embraced each other, and awaited in patience and charity the stroke of martyrdom.
 But the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> were animated only by the spirit of religion, and that spirit was productive only of animosity and discord.
 Before his death, the emperor John <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> had renounced the unpopular measure of a union with the Latins; nor was the idea revived, till the distress of his brother <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> imposed a last trial of flattery and dissimulation.
 (32) With the demand of temporal aid, his ambassadors were instructed to mingle the assurance of spiritual obedience: his neglect of the church was excused by the urgent cares of the state; and his orthodox wishes solicited the presence of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> legate.
 The <FAC>Vatican</FAC> had been too often deluded; yet the signs of repentance could not decently be overlooked; a legate was more easily granted than an army; and about six months before the final destruction, the cardinal <PERSON>Isidore</PERSON> of <GPE>Russia</GPE> appeared in that character with a retinue of priests and soldiers.
 The emperor saluted him as a friend and father; respectfully listened to his public and private sermons; and with the most obsequious of the clergy and laymen subscribed the act of union, as it had been ratified in the council of Florence.
 On the twelfth of December, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, in the church of St.
 Sophia, joined in the communion of sacrifice and prayer; and the names of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> pontiffs were solemnly commemorated; the names of <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the Fifth, the vicar of Christ, and of the patriarch Gregory, who had been driven into exile by a rebellious people.
 Obstinacy and fanaticism of the Greeks.
 But the dress and language of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> priest who officiated at the altar were an object of scandal; and it was observed with horror, that he consecrated a cake or wafer of unleavened bread, and poured cold water into the cup of the sacrament.
 A national historian acknowledges with a blush, that none of his countrymen, not the emperor himself, were sincere in this occasional conformity.
 (33) Their hasty and unconditional submission was palliated by a promise of future revisal; but the best, or the worst, of their excuses was the confession of their own perjury.
 When they were pressed by the reproaches of their honest brethren, But patience is not the attribute of zeal; nor can the arts of a court be adapted to the freedom and violence of popular enthusiasm.
 From the dome of St.
 Sophia the inhabitants of either sex, and of every degree, rushed in crowds to the cell of the monk Gennadius, (34) to consult the oracle of the church.
 The holy man was invisible; entranced, as it should seem, in deep meditation, or divine rapture: but he had exposed on the door of his cell a speaking tablet; and they successively withdrew, after reading those tremendous words: According to the advice of Gennadius, the religious virgins, as pure as angels, and as proud as daemons, rejected the act of union, and abjured all communion with the present and future associates of the Latins; and their example was applauded and imitated by the greatest part of the clergy and people.
 From the monastery, the devout <NORP>Greeks</NORP> dispersed themselves in the taverns; drank confusion to the slaves of the pope; emptied their glasses in honour of the image of the holy Virgin; and besought her to defend against <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> the city which she had formerly saved from <NORP>Chosroes</NORP> and the Chagan.
 In the double intoxication of zeal and wine, they valiantly exclaimed, "What occasion have we for succour, or union, or Latins? Far from us be the worship of the Azymites!" During the <DATE>winter</DATE> that preceded the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> conquest, the nation was distracted by this epidemical frenzy; and the season of Lent, the approach of Easter, instead of breathing charity and love, served only to fortify the obstinacy and influence of the zealots.
 The confessors scrutinized and alarmed the conscience of their votaries, and a rigorous penance was imposed on those who had received the communion from a priest who had given an express or tacit consent to the union.
 His service at the altar propagated the infection to the mute and simple spectators of the ceremony: they forfeited, by the impure spectacle, the virtue of the sacerdotal character; nor was it lawful, even in danger of sudden death, to invoke the assistance of their prayers or absolution.
 No sooner had the church of St.
 Sophia been polluted by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> sacrifice, than it was deserted as a <NORP>Jewish</NORP> synagogue, or a heathen temple, by the clergy and people; and a vast and gloomy silence prevailed in that venerable dome, which had so often smoked with a cloud of incense, blazed with innumerable lights, and resounded with the voice of prayer and thanksgiving.
 The <NORP>Latins</NORP> were the most odious of heretics and infidels; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> minister of the empire, the great duke, was heard to declare, that he had rather behold in <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> the turban of Mahomet, than the pope's tiara or a cardinal's hat.
 (35) A sentiment so unworthy of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and patriots was familiar and fatal to the Greeks: the emperor was deprived of the affection and support of his subjects; and their native cowardice was sanctified by resignation to the divine decree, or the visionary hope of a miraculous deliverance.
 Siege of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> II.
 A.
D.
 1453, <DATE>April</DATE> 6-May 29.
 Of the triangle which composes the figure of Constantinople, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sides along the sea were made inaccessible to an enemy; the <PRODUCT>Propontis</PRODUCT> by nature, and the harbour by art.
 Between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> waters, the basis of the triangle, the land side was protected by a double wall, and a deep ditch of the depth of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> feet.
 Against this line of fortification, which Phranza, an eye-witness, prolongs to the measure of six miles, (36) the <NORP>Ottomans</NORP> directed their principal attack; and the emperor, after distributing the service and command of the most perilous stations, undertook the defence of the external wall.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of the siege the <NORP>Greek</NORP> soldiers descended into the ditch, or sallied into the field; but they soon discovered, that, in the proportion of their numbers, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> was of more value than twenty Turks: and, after these bold preludes, they were prudently content to maintain the rampart with their missile weapons.
 Nor should this prudence be accused of pusillanimity.
 The nation was indeed pusillanimous and base; but the last <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> deserves the name of a hero: his noble band of volunteers was inspired with <NORP>Roman</NORP> virtue; and the foreign auxiliaries supported the honour of the <NORP>Western</NORP> chivalry.
 The incessant volleys of lances and arrows were accompanied with the smoke, the sound, and the fire, of their musketry and cannon.
 Their small arms discharged at the same time either five, or even ten, balls of lead, of the size of a walnut; and, according to the closeness of the ranks and the force of the powder, several breastplates and bodies were transpierced by the same shot.
 But the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> approaches were soon sunk in trenches, or covered with ruins.
 Each day added to the science of the Christians; but their inadequate stock of gunpowder was wasted in the operations of each day.
 Their ordnance was not powerful, either in size or number; and if they possessed some heavy cannon, they feared to plant them on the walls, lest the aged structure should be shaken and overthrown by the explosion.
 (37) The same destructive secret had been revealed to the Moslems; by whom it was employed with the superior energy of zeal, riches, and despotism.
 The great cannon of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> has been separately noticed; an important and visible object in the history of the times: but that enormous engine was flanked by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fellows almost of equal magnitude: (38) the long order of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> artillery was pointed against the walls; <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> batteries thundered at once on the most accessible places; and of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these it is ambiguously expressed, that it was mounted with <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> guns, or that it discharged <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> bullets.
 Yet in the power and activity of the sultan, we may discern the infancy of the new science.
 Under a master who counted the moments, the great cannon could be loaded and fired no more than <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> times in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day.
 (39) The heated metal unfortunately burst; several workmen were destroyed; and the skill of an artist was admired who bethought himself of preventing the danger and the accident, by pouring oil, after each explosion, into the mouth of the cannon.
 Attack and defence.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> random shots were productive of more sound than effect; and it was by the advice of a Christian, that the engineers were taught to level their aim against the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> opposite sides of the salient angles of a bastion.
 However imperfect, the weight and repetition of the fire made some impression on the walls; and the Turks, pushing their approaches to the edge of the ditch, attempted to fill the enormous chasm, and to build a road to the assault.
 (40) Innumerable fascines, and hogsheads, and trunks of trees, were heaped on each other; and such was the impetuosity of the throng, that the foremost and the weakest were pushed headlong down the precipice, and instantly buried under the accumulated mass.
 To fill the ditch, was the toil of the besiegers; to clear away the rubbish, was the safety of the besieged; and, after a long and bloody conflict, the web that had been woven in the day was still unravelled in the night.
 The next resource of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was the practice of mines; but the soil was rocky; in every attempt he was stopped and undermined by the <NORP>Christian</NORP> engineers; nor had the .
art been yet invented of replenishing those subterraneous passages with gunpowder, and blowing whole towers and cities into the air.
 (41) A circumstance that distinguishes the siege of Constantinople, is the re-union of the ancient and modern artillery.
 The cannon were intermingled with the mechanical engines for casting stones and darts; the bullet and the battering-ram were directed against the same walls; nor had the discovery of gunpowder superseded the use of the liquid and unextinguishable fire.
 A wooden turret of the largest size was advanced on rollers: this portable magazine of ammunition and fascines was protected by a threefold covering of bulls hides; incessant vollies were securely discharged from the loop-holes; in the front, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> doors were contrived for the alternate sally and retreat of the soldiers and workmen.
 They ascended by a stair-case to the upper platform; and, as high as the level of that platform, a scaling-ladder could be raised by pullies to form a bridge and grapple with the adverse rampart.
 By these various arts of annoyance, some as new as they were pernicious to the Greeks, the tower of St.
 Romanus was at length overturned: after a severe struggle, the <NORP>Turks</NORP> were repulsed from the breach and interrupted by darkness; but they trusted, that with the return of light they should renew the attack with fresh vigour and decisive success.
 Of this pause of action, this interval of hope, each moment was improved by the activity of the emperor and Justinian, who passed the night on the spot, and urged the labours which involved the safety of the church and city.
 At the dawn of day, the impatient sultan perceived, with astonishment and grief, that his wooden turret had been reduced to ashes: the ditch was cleared and restored; and the tower of St.
 Romanus was again strong and entire.
 He deplored the failure of his design; and uttered a profane exclamation, that the word of the thirty-seven thousand prophets should not have compelled him to believe that such a work, in so short a time, could have been accomplished by the infidels.
 Succour and victory of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> ships The generosity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes was cold and tardy; but in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> apprehension of a siege, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had negotiated, in the isles of the Archipelago, the Morea, and Sicily, the most indispensable supplies.
 As early as the beginning of April, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> (42) great ships, equipped for merchandise and war, would have sailed from the harbour of Chios, had not the wind blown obstinately from the north.
 (43) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of these ships bore the imperial flag; the remaining <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> belonged to the Genoese; and they were laden with wheat and barley, with wine, oil, and vegetables, and, above all, with soldiers and mariners for the service of the capital.
 After a tedious delay, a gentle breeze, and, on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day, a strong gale from the south, carried them through the <PRODUCT>Hellespont</PRODUCT> and the Propontis: but the city was already invested by sea and land; and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> fleet, at the entrance of the Bosphorus, was stretched from shore to shore, in the form of a crescent, to intercept, or at least to repel, these bold auxiliaries.
 The reader who has present to his mind the geographical picture of Constantinople, will conceive and admire the greatness of the spectacle.
 The <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <NORP>Christian</NORP> ships continued to advance with joyful shouts, and a full press both of sails and oars, against a hostile fleet of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> vessels; and the rampart, the camp, the coasts of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, were lined with innumerable spectators, who anxiously awaited the event of this momentous succour.
 At the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> view that event could not appear doubtful; the superiority of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> was beyond all measure or account: and, in a calm, their numbers and valour must inevitably have prevailed.
 But their hasty and imperfect navy had been created, not by the genius of the people, but by the will of the sultan: in the height of their prosperity, the <NORP>Turks</NORP> have acknowledged, that if God had given them the earth, he had left the sea to the infidels; (44) and a series of defeats, a rapid progress of decay, has established the truth of their modest confession.
 Except <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> galleys of some force, the rest of their fleet consisted of open boats, rudely constructed and awkwardly managed, crowded with troops, and destitute of cannon; and since courage arises in a great measure from the consciousness of strength, the bravest of the <PERSON>Janizaries</PERSON> might tremble on a new element.
 In the <NORP>Christian</NORP> squadron, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> stout and lofty ships were guided by skilful pilots, and manned with the veterans of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Greece, long practised in the arts and perils of the sea.
 Their weight was directed to sink or scatter the weak obstacles that impeded their passage: their artillery swept the waters: their liquid fire was poured on the heads of the adversaries, who, with the design of boarding, presumed to approach them; and the winds and waves are always on the side of the ablest navigators.
 In this conflict, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> vessel, which had been almost overpowered, was rescued by the Genoese; but the Turks, in a distant and closer attack, were twice repulsed with considerable loss.
 <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> himself sat on horseback on the beach to encourage their valour by his voice and presence, by the promise of reward, and by fear more potent than the fear of the enemy.
 The passions of his soul, and even the gestures of his body, (45) seemed to imitate the actions of the combatants; and, as if he had been the lord of nature, he spurred his horse with a fearless and impotent effort into the sea.
 His loud reproaches, and the clamours of the camp, urged the <NORP>Ottomans</NORP> to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> attack, more fatal and bloody than the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former; and I must repeat, though I cannot credit, the evidence of Phranza, who affirms, from their own mouth, that they lost above <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> thousand men in the slaughter of the day.
 They fled in disorder to the shores of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, while the <NORP>Christian</NORP> squadron, triumphant and unhurt, steered along the Bosphorus, and securely anchored within the chain of the harbour.
 In the confidence of victory, they boasted that the whole <NORP>Turkish</NORP> power must have yielded to their arms; but the admiral, or captain bashaw, found some consolation for a painful wound in his eye, by representing that accident as the cause of his defeat.
 Balthi Ogli was a renegade of the race of the <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> princes: his military character was tainted with the unpopular vice of avarice; and under the despotism of the prince or people, misfortune is a sufficient evidence of guilt.
 His rank and services were annihilated by the displeasure of Mahomet.
 In the royal presence, the captain bashaw was extended on the ground by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> slaves, and received <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> strokes with a golden rod: (46) his death had been pronounced; and he adored the clemency of the sultan, who was satisfied with the milder punishment of confiscation and exile.
 The introduction of this supply revived the hopes of the Greeks, and accused the supineness of their <NORP>Western</NORP> allies.
 Amidst the deserts of <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> and the rocks of Palestine, the <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of the crusades had buried themselves in a voluntary and inevitable grave; but the situation of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city was strong against her enemies, and accessible to her friends; and a rational and moderate armament of the marine states might have saved the relics of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name, and maintained a <NORP>Christian</NORP> fortress in the heart of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> empire.
 Yet this was the sole and feeble attempt for the deliverance of Constantinople: the more distant powers were insensible of its danger; and the ambassador of Hungary, or at least of Huniades, resided in the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> camp, to remove the fears, and to direct the operations, of the sultan.
 (47) <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> transports his navy over land.
 It was difficult for the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> to penetrate the secret of the divan; yet the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> are persuaded, that a resistance so obstinate and surprising, had fatigued the perseverance of Mahomet.
 He began to meditate a retreat; and the siege would have been speedily raised, if the ambition and jealousy of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> vizier had not opposed the perfidious advice of Calil Bashaw, who still maintained a secret correspondence with the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The reduction of the city appeared to be hopeless, unless a double attack could be made from the harbour as well as from the land; but the harbour was inaccessible: an impenetrable chain was now defended by <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> large ships, more than twenty of a smaller size, with several galleys and sloops; and, instead of forcing this barrier, the <NORP>Turks</NORP> might apprehend a naval sally, and a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> encounter in the open sea.
 In this perplexity, the genius of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> conceived and executed a plan of a bold and marvellous cast, of transporting by land his lighter vessels and military stores from the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> into the higher part of the harbour.
 The distance is about <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> miles; the ground is uneven, and was overspread with thickets; and, as the road must be opened behind the suburb of Galata, their free passage or total destruction must depend on the option of the Genoese.
 But these selfish merchants were ambitious of the favour of being the last devoured; and the deficiency of art was supplied by the strength of obedient myraids.
 A level way was covered with a broad platform of strong and solid planks; and to render them more slippery and smooth, they were anointed with the fat of sheep and oxen.
 Fourscore light galleys and brigantines, of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> oars, were disembarked on the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> shore; arranged successively on rollers; and drawn forwards by the power of men and pulleys.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> guides or pilots were stationed at the helm, and the prow, of each vessel: the sails were unfurled to the winds; and the labor was cheered by song and acclamation.
 In the course of a single night, this <NORP>Turkish</NORP> fleet painfully climbed the hill, steered over the plain, and was launched from the declivity into the shallow waters of the harbour, far above the molestation of the deeper vessels of the Greeks.
 The real importance of this operation was magnified by the consternation and confidence which it inspired: but the notorious, unquestionable fact was displayed before the eyes, and is recorded by the pens, of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations.
 (48) A similar stratagem had been repeatedly practised by the ancients; (49) the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> galleys (I must again repeat) should be considered as large boats; and, if we compare the magnitude and the distance, the obstacles and the means, the boasted miracle (50) has perhaps been equalled by the industry of our own times.
 (51) As soon as <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> had occupied the upper harbour with a fleet and army, he constructed, in the narrowest part, a bridge, or rather mole, of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> cubits in breadth, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> in length: it was formed of casks and hogsheads; joined with rafters, linked with iron, and covered with a solid floor.
 On this floating battery he planted <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his largest cannon, while the fourscore galleys, with troops and scaling ladders, approached the most accessible side, which had formerly been stormed by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> conquerors.
 The indolence of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> has been accused for not destroying these unfinished works; but their fire, by a superior fire, was controlled and silenced; nor were they wanting in a nocturnal attempt to burn the vessels as well as the bridge of the sultan.
 His vigilance prevented their approach; their foremost galiots were sunk or taken; <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> youths, the bravest of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Greece, were inhumanly massacred at his command; nor could the emperor's grief be assuaged by the just though cruel retaliation, of exposing from the walls the heads of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> captives.
 Distress of the city.
 After a siege of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> days, the fate of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> could no longer be averted.
 The diminutive garrison was exhausted by a double attack: the fortifications, which had stood for ages against hostile violence, were dismantled on all sides by the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> cannon: many breaches were opened; and near the gate of St.
 Romanus, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> towers had been levelled with the ground.
 For the payment of his feeble and mutinous troops, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was compelled to despoil the churches with the promise of a fourfold restitution; and his sacrilege offered a new reproach to the enemies of the union.
 A spirit of discord impaired the remnant of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> strength; the <NORP>Genoese</NORP> and <NORP>Venetian</NORP> auxiliaries asserted the pre-eminence of their respective service; and <PERSON>Justiniani</PERSON> and the great duke, whose ambition was not extinguished by the common danger, accused each other of treachery and cowardice.
 Preparations of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> for the general assault, May 26.
 During the siege of Constantinople, the words of peace and capitulation had been sometimes pronounced; and several embassies had passed between the camp and the city.
 (52) The <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor was humbled by adversity; and would have yielded to any terms compatible with religion and royalty.
 The <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan was desirous of sparing the blood of his soldiers; still more desirous of securing for his own use the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> treasures: and he accomplished a sacred duty in presenting to the <NORP>Gabours</NORP> the choice of circumcision, of tribute, or of death.
 The avarice of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> might have been satisfied with an <DATE>annual</DATE> sum of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand ducats; but his ambition grasped the capital of the East: to the prince he offered a rich equivalent, to the people a free toleration, or a safe departure: but after some fruitless treaty, he declared his resolution of finding either a throne, or a grave, under the walls of Constantinople.
 A sense of honour, and the fear of universal reproach, forbade <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> to resign the city into the hands of the Ottomans; and he determined to abide the last extremities of war.
 Several days were employed by the sultan in the preparations of the assault; and a respite was granted by his favourite science of astrology, which had fixed on the twenty-ninth of May, as the fortunate and fatal hour.
 On the evening of the twenty-seventh, he issued his final orders; assembled in his presence the military chiefs, and dispersed his heralds through the camp to proclaim the duty, and the motives, of the perilous enterprise.
 Fear is the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> principle of a despotic government; and his menaces were expressed in the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> style, that the fugitives and deserters, had they the wings of a bird, (53) should not escape from his inexorable justice.
 The greatest part of his bashaws and <PERSON>Janizaries</PERSON> were the offspring of <NORP>Christian</NORP> parents: but the glories of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> name were perpetuated by successive adoption; and in the gradual change of individuals, the spirit of a legion, a regiment, or an oda, is kept alive by imitation and discipline.
 In this holy warfare, the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were exhorted to purify their minds with prayer, their bodies with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> ablutions; and to abstain from food till the close of the ensuing day.
 A crowd of dervises visited the tents, to instil the desire of martyrdom, and the assurance of spending an immortal youth amidst the rivers and gardens of paradise, and in the embraces of the black-eyed virgins.
 Yet <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> principally trusted to the efficacy of temporal and visible rewards.
 A double pay was promised to the victorious troops: Such various and potent motives diffused among the <NORP>Turks</NORP> a general ardour, regardless of life and impatient for action: the camp re-echoed with the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> shouts of "God is God: there is but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> God, and <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> is the apostle of God;" (54) and the sea and land, from <GPE>Galata</GPE> to the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> towers, were illuminated by the blaze of their nocturnal fires.
 Last farewell of the emperor and the Greeks.
 Far different was the state of the Christians; who, with loud and impotent complaints, deplored the guilt, or the punishment, of their sins.
 The celestial image of the <PERSON>Virgin</PERSON> had been exposed in solemn procession; but their divine patroness was deaf to their entreaties: they accused the obstinacy of the emperor for refusing a timely surrender; anticipated the horrors of their fate; and sighed for the repose and security of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> servitude.
 The noblest of the Greeks, and the bravest of the allies, were summoned to the palace, to prepare them, on the evening of the twenty-eighth, for the duties and dangers of the general assault.
 The last speech of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> was the funeral oration of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire: (55) he promised, he conjured, and he vainly attempted to infuse the hope which was extinguished in his own mind.
 In this world all was comfortless and gloomy; and neither the gospel nor the church have proposed any conspicuous recompense to the heroes who fall in the service of their country.
 But the example of their prince, and the confinement of a siege, had armed these warriors with the courage of despair, and the pathetic scene is described by the feelings of the historian Phranza, who was himself present at this mournful assembly.
 They wept, they embraced; regardless of their families and fortunes, they devoted their lives; and each commander, departing to his station, maintained all night a vigilant and anxious watch on the rampart.
 The emperor, and some faithful companions, entered the dome of St.
 Sophia, which in a few hours was to be converted into a mosque; and devoutly received, with tears and prayers, the sacrament of the holy communion.
 He reposed some moments in the palace, which resounded with cries and lamentations; solicited the pardon of all whom he might have injured; (56) and mounted on horseback to visit the guards, and explore the motions of the enemy.
 The distress and fall of the last <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> are more glorious than the long prosperity of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> Caesars.
 The general assault, May 29.
 In the confusion of darkness, an assailant may sometimes succeed; out in this great and general attack, the military judgment and astrological knowledge of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> advised him to expect the morning, the memorable twenty-ninth of May, in the <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and fifty-third year of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aera.
 The preceding night had been strenuously employed: the troops, the cannons, and the fascines, were advanced to the edge of the ditch, which in many parts presented a smooth and level passage to the breach; and his fourscore galleys almost touched, with the prows and their scaling-ladders, the less defensible walls of the harbour.
 Under pain of death, silence was enjoined: but the physical laws of motion and sound are not obedient to discipline or fear; each individual might suppress his voice and measure his footsteps; but the march and labor of <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> must inevitably produce a strange confusion of dissonant clamours, which reached the ears of the watchmen of the towers.
 At daybreak, without the customary signal of the <TIME>morning</TIME> gun, the <NORP>Turks</NORP> assaulted the city by sea and land; and the similitude of a twined or twisted thread has been applied to the closeness and continuity of their line of attack.
 (57) The foremost ranks consisted of the refuse of the host, a voluntary crowd who fought without order or command; of the feebleness of age or childhood, of peasants and vagrants, and of all who had joined the camp in the blind hope of plunder and martyrdom.
 The common impulse drove them onwards to the wall; the most audacious to climb were instantly precipitated; and not a dart, not a bullet, of the Christians, was idly wasted on the accumulated throng.
 But their strength and ammunition were exhausted in this laborious defence: the ditch was filled with the bodies of the slain; they supported the footsteps of their companions; and of this devoted vanguard the death was more serviceable than the life.
 Under their respective bashaws and sanjaks, the troops of <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> and <GPE>Romania</GPE> were successively led to the charge: their progress was various and doubtful; but, after a conflict of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hours, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> still maintained, and improved their advantage; and the voice of the emperor was heard, encouraging his soldiers to achieve, by a last effort, the deliverance of their country.
 In that fatal moment, the <PERSON>Janizaries</PERSON> arose, fresh, vigorous, and invincible.
 The sultan himself on horseback, with an iron mace in his hand, was the spectator and judge of their valour: he was surrounded by <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand of his domestic troops, whom he reserved for the decisive occasion; and the tide of battle was directed and impelled by his voice and eye.
 His numerous ministers of justice were posted behind the line, to urge, to restrain, and to punish; and if danger was in the front, shame and inevitable death were in the rear, of the fugitives.
 The cries of fear and of pain were drowned in the martial music of drums, trumpets, and attaballs; and experience has proved, that the mechanical operation of sounds, by quickening the circulation of the blood and spirits, will act on the human machine more forcibly than the eloquence of reason and honour.
 From the lines, the galleys, and the bridge, the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> artillery thundered on all sides; and the camp and city, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and the Turks, were involved in a cloud of smoke which could only be dispelled by the final deliverance or destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The single combats of the heroes of history or fable amuse our fancy and engage our affections: the skilful evolutions of war may inform the mind, and improve a necessary, though pernicious, science.
 But in the uniform and odious pictures of a general assault, all is blood, and horror, and confusion nor shall I strive, at the distance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> centuries, and a thousand miles, to delineate a scene of which there could be no spectators, and of which the actors themselves were incapable of forming any just or adequate idea.
 The immediate loss of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> may be ascribed to the bullet, or arrow, which pierced the gauntlet of John Justiniani.
 The sight of his blood, and the exquisite pain, appalled the courage of the chief, whose arms and counsels were the firmest rampart of the city.
 As he withdrew from his station in quest of a surgeon, his flight was perceived and stopped by the indefatigable emperor.
 and at these words he hastily passed through <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the breaches of the inner wall.
 By this pusillanimous act he stained the honours of a military life; and the few days which he survived in Galata, or the Isle of Chios, were embittered by his own and the public reproach.
 (58) His example was imitated by the greatest part of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> auxiliaries, and the defence began to slacken when the attack was pressed with redoubled vigour.
 The number of the <NORP>Ottomans</NORP> was fifty, perhaps a hundred, times superior to that of the Christians; the double walls were reduced by the cannon to a heap of ruins: in a circuit of several miles, some places must be found more easy of access, or more feebly guarded; and if the besiegers could penetrate in a single point, the whole city was irrecoverably lost.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who deserved the sultan's reward was <PERSON>Hassan</PERSON> the Janizary, of gigantic stature and strength.
 With his cimeter in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hand and his buckler in the other, he ascended the outward fortification: of the <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> Janizaries, who were emulous of his valour, <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> perished in the bold adventure.
 <PERSON>Hassan</PERSON> and his <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> companions had reached the summit: the giant was precipitated from the rampart: he rose on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> knee, and was again oppressed by a shower of darts and stones.
 But his success had proved that the achievement was possible: the walls and towers were instantly covered with a swarm of Turks; and the Greeks, now driven from the vantage ground, were overwhelmed by increasing multitudes.
 Amidst these multitudes, the emperor, (59) who accomplished all the duties of a general and a soldier, was long seen and finally lost.
 The nobles, who fought round his person, sustained, till their last breath, the honourable names of <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> and Cantacuzene: his mournful exclamation was heard, "Cannot there be found a <NORP>Christian</NORP> to cut off my head?" (60) and his last fear was that of falling alive into the hands of the infidels.
 (61) Death of the emperor <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> The prudent despair of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> cast away the purple: amidst the tumult he fell by an unknown hand, and his body was buried under a mountain of the slain.
 After his death, resistance and order were no more: the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> fled towards the city; and many were pressed and stifled in the narrow pass of the gate of St.
 Romanus.
 The victorious <NORP>Turks</NORP> rushed through the breaches of the inner wall; and as they advanced into the streets, they were soon joined by their brethren, who had forced the gate <PRODUCT>Phenar</PRODUCT> on the side of the harbour.
 (62) In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> heat of the pursuit, about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Christians</NORP> were put to the sword; but avarice soon prevailed over cruelty; and the victors acknowledged, that they should immediately have given <CARDINAL>quarter</CARDINAL> if the valour of the emperor and his chosen bands had not prepared them for a similar opposition in every part of the capital.
 Loss of the city and empire.
 It was thus, after a siege of fifty-three days, that Constantinople, which had defied the power of Chosroes, the Chagan, and the caliphs, was irretrievably subdued by the arms of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> the Second.
 Her empire only had been subverted by the Latins: her religion was trampled in the dust by the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> conquerors.
 (63) The <NORP>Turks</NORP> enter and pillage Constantinople.
 The tidings of misfortune fly with a rapid wing; yet such was the extent of Constantinople, that the more distant quarters might prolong, some moments, the happy ignorance of their ruin.
 (64) But in the general consternation, in the feelings of selfish or social anxiety, in the tumult and thunder of the assault, a sleepless night and <TIME>morning</TIME> must have elapsed; nor can I believe that many <NORP>Grecian</NORP> ladies were awakened by the <PERSON>Janizaries</PERSON> from a sound and tranquil slumber.
 On the assurance of the public calamity, the houses and convents were instantly deserted; and the trembling inhabitants flocked together in the streets, like a herd of timid animals, as if accumulated weakness could be productive of strength, or in the vain hope, that amid the crowd each individual might be safe and invisible.
 From every part of the capital, they flowed into the church of St.
 Sophia: in the space of an hour, the sanctuary, the choir, the nave, the upper and lower galleries, were filled with the multitudes of fathers and husbands, of women and children, of priests, monks, and religious virgins: the doors were barred on the inside, and they sought protection from the sacred dome, which they had so lately abhorred as a profane and polluted edifice.
 Their confidence was founded on the prophecy of an enthusiast or impostor; that <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day the <NORP>Turks</NORP> would enter Constantinople, and pursue the <NORP>Romans</NORP> as far as the column of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> in the square before St.
 Sophia: but that this would be the term of their calamities: that an angel would descend from heaven, with a sword in his hand, and would deliver the empire, with that celestial weapon, to a poor man seated at the foot of the column.
 At these animating words, the <NORP>Turks</NORP> would instantly fly, and the victorious <NORP>Romans</NORP> would drive them from the West, and from all <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> as far as the frontiers of Persia.
 It is on this occasion that Ducas, with some fancy and much truth, upbraids the discord and obstinacy of the Greeks.
 Captivity of the Greeks.
 While they expected the descent of the tardy angel, the doors were broken with axes; and as the <NORP>Turks</NORP> encountered no resistance, their bloodless hands were employed in selecting and securing the multitude of their prisoners.
 Youth, beauty, and the appearance of wealth, attracted their choice; and the right of property was decided among themselves by a prior seizure, by personal strength, and by the authority of command.
 In the space of an hour the male captives were bound with cords, the females with their veils and girdles.
 The senators were linked with their slaves; the prelates with the porters of the church; and young men of a plebeian class with noble maids whose faces had been invisible to the sun and their nearest kindred.
 In this common captivity the ranks of society were confounded; the ties of nature were cut asunder; and the inexorable soldier was careless of the father's groans, the tears of the mother, and the lamentations of the children.
 The loudest in their wailings were the nuns, who were torn from the altar with naked bosoms, outstretched hands, and dishevelled hair; and we should piously believe that few could be tempted to prefer the vigils of the harem to those of the monastery.
 Of these unfortunate Greeks, of these domestic animals, whole strings were rudely driven through the streets; and as the conquerors were eager to return for more prey, their trembling pace was quickened with menaces and blows.
 At the same hour a similar rapine was exercised in all the churches and monasteries, in all the palaces and habitations, of the capital; nor could any place, however sacred or sequestered, protect the persons or the property of the Greeks.
 Above <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> thousand of this devoted people were transported from the city to the camp and fleet, exchanged or sold according to the caprice or interest of their masters, and dispersed in remote servitude through the provinces of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> empire.
 Among these we may notice some remarkable characters.
 The historian Phranza, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> chamberlain and principal secretary, was involved with his family in the common lot.
 After suffering <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> months the hardships of slavery, he recovered his freedom: in the ensuing <DATE>winter</DATE> he ventured to Adrianople, and ransomed his wife from the mir bashi, or master of the horse; but his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> children, in the flower of youth and beauty, had been seized for the use of <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> himself.
 The daughter of <PERSON>Phranza</PERSON> died in the seraglio, perhaps a virgin: his son, in the <ORDINAL>fifteenth</ORDINAL> year of his age, preferred death to infamy, and was stabbed by the hand of the royal lover.
 (66) A deed thus inhuman cannot surely be expiated by the taste and liberality with which he released a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> matron and her <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> daughters, on receiving a <NORP>Latin</NORP> ode from Philelphus, who had chosen a wife in that noble family.
(67) The pride or cruelty of <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> would have been most sensibly gratified by the capture of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> legate; but the dexterity of Cardinal <PERSON>Isidore</PERSON> eluded the search, and he escaped from <GPE>Galata</GPE> in a plebeian habit.
(69) The chain and entrance of the outward harbour was still occupied by the <NORP>Italian</NORP> ships of merchandise and war.
 They had signalised their valour in the siege: they embraced the moment of retreat, while the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> mariners were dissipated in the pillage of the city.
 When they hoisted sail, the beach was covered with a suppliant and lamentable crowd; but the means of transportation were scanty, the <NORP>Venetians</NORP> and <NORP>Genoese</NORP> selected their countrymen; and, notwithstanding the fairest promises of the sultan, the inhabitants of <GPE>Galata</GPE> evacuated their houses, and embarked with their most precious effects.
 Amount of the spoil.
 In the fall and the sack of great cities an historian is condemned to repeat the tale of uniform calamity: the same effects must be produced by the same passions; and when those passions may be indulged with out control, small, alas! is the difference between civilised and savage man.
 Amidst the vague exclamations of bigotry and hatred, the <NORP>Turks</NORP> are not accused of a wanton or immoderate effusion of <NORP>Christian</NORP> blood: but according to their maxims (the maxims of antiquity), the lives of the vanquished were forfeited; and the legitimate reward of the conqueror was derived from the service, the sale, or the ransom of his captives of both sexes.
 (69) The wealth of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had been granted by the sultan to his victorious troops; and the rapine of an hour is more productive than the industry of years.
 But as no regular division was attempted of the spoil, the respective shares were not determined by merit; and the rewards of valour were stolen away by the followers of the camp, who had declined the toil and danger of the battle.
 The narrative of their depredations could not afford either amusement or instruction: the total amount, in the last poverty of the empire, has been valued at <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of ducats; (70) and of this sum a small part was the property of the Venetians, the Genoese, the Florentines, and the merchants of Ancona.
 Of these foreigners the stock was improved ,in quick and perpetual circulation: but the riches of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were displayed in the idle ostentation of palaces and wardrobes, or deeply buried in treasures of ingots and old coin, lest it should be demanded at their hands for the defence of their country.
 The profanation and plunder of the monasteries and churches excited the most tragic complaints.
 The dome of St.
 Sophia itself, the earthly heaven, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> firmament, the vehicle of the cherubim, the throne of the glory of God, (71) was despoiled of the oblations of ages; and the gold and silver, the pearls and jewels, the vases and sacerdotal ornaments, were most wickedly converted to the service of mankind.
 After the divine images had been stripped of all that could be valuable to a profane eye, the canvas, or the wood, was torn, or broken, or burnt, or trod under foot or applied, in the stables or the kitchen, to the vilest uses.
 The example of sacrilege was imitated, however, from the <NORP>Latin</NORP> conquerors of Constantinople; and the treatment which Christ, the Virgin, and the saints had sustained from the guilty Catholic, might be inflicted by the zealous <NORP>Musulman</NORP> on the monuments of idolatry.
 Perhaps, instead of joining the public clamour, a philosopher will observe that in the decline of the arts the workmanship could not be more valuable than the work, and that a fresh supply of visions and miracles would speedily be renewed by the craft of the priest and the credulity of the people.
 He will more seriously deplore the loss of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> libraries, which were destroyed or scattered in the general confusion: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty thousand manuscripts are said to have disappeared; (72) <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> volumes might be purchased for a single ducat; and the same ignominious price, too high perhaps for a shelf of theology, included the whole works of <PERSON>Aristotle</PERSON> and Homer, the noblest productions of the science and literature of ancient Greece.
 We may reflect with pleasure that an inestimable portion of our classic treasures was safely deposited in Italy; and that the mechanics of a <NORP>German</NORP> town had invented an art which derides the havoc of time and barbarism.
 <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> II.
 visits the city, St.
 Sophia, the palace etc.
 From the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> hour (73) of the memorable twenty-ninth of May, disorder and rapine prevailed in <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> till the eighth hour of the same day, when the sultan himself passed in triumph through the gate of St.
 Romanus.
 He was attended by his vizirs, bashaws, and guards, each of whom (says a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian) was robust as Hercules, dexterous as Apollo, and equal in battle to any <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> of the race of ordinary mortals.
 The conqueror (74) gazed with satisfaction and wonder on the strange though splendid appearance of the domes and palaces, so dissimilar from the style of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> architecture.
 In the hippodrome, or atmeidan, his eye was attracted by the twisted column of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> serpents; and, as a trial of his strength, he shattered with his iron mace or battle-axe the under jaw of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of these monsters, (75) which in the eyes of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> were the idols or talismans of the city.
 At the principal door of St.
 Sophia he alighted from his horse and entered the dome; and such was his jealous regard for that monument of his glory, that, on observing a zealous <NORP>Musulman</NORP> in the act of breaking the marble pavement, he admonished him with his scimitar that, if the spoil and captives were granted to the soldiers, the public and private buildings had been reserved for the prince.
 By his command the metropolis of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> church was transformed into a mosque: the rich and portable instruments of superstition had been removed; the crosses were thrown down; and the walls, which were covered with images and mosaics, were washed and purified, and restored to a state of naked simplicity.
 On the same day, or on the ensuing Friday, the muezin, or crier, ascended the most lofty turret, and proclaimed the esan, or public invitation, in the name of God and his prophet; the imam preached and <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> performed the namaz of prayer and thanks giving on the great altar, where the <NORP>Christian</NORP> mysteries had so lately been celebrated before the last of the Caesars.
 (76) From St.
 Sophia he proceeded to the august but desolate mansion of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> successors of the great Constantine, but which in a few hours had been stripped of the pomp of royalty.
 A melancholy reflection on the vicissitudes of human greatness forced itself on his mind, and he repeated an elegant distich of <NORP>Persian</NORP> poetry: His behaviour to the Greeks.
 Yet his mind was not satisfied, nor did the victory seem complete, till he was informed of the fate of Constantine—whether he had escaped or been made prisoner, or had fallen in the battle.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Janizaries</PERSON> claimed the honour and reward of his death: the body, under a heap of slain, was discovered by the golden eagles embroidered on his shoes; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> acknowledged with tears the head of their late emperor and, after exposing the bloody trophy, (78) <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> bestowed on his rival the honours of a decent funeral.
 After his decease Lucas Notaras, great duke (79) and <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> minister of the empire, was the most important prisoner.
 When he offered his person and his treasures at the foot of the throne, The great duke alleged the obstinacy of the strangers, and some secret encouragement from the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> vizir; and from this perilous interview he was at length dismissed with the assurance of pardon and protection.
 <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> condescended to visit his wife, a venerable princess oppressed with sickness and grief; and his consolation for her misfortunes was in the most tender strain of humanity and filial reverence.
 A similar clemency was extended to the principal officers of state, of whom several were ransomed at his expense; and during some days he declared himself the friend and father of the vanquished people.
 But the scene was soon changed, and before his departure the hippodrome streamed with the blood of his noblest captives.
 His perfidious cruelty is execrated by the Christians: they adorn with the colours of heroic martyrdom the execution of the great duke and his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, and his death is ascribed to the generous refusal of delivering his children to the tyrant's lust.
 Yet a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> historian has dropped an unguarded word of conspiracy, deliverance, and <NORP>Italian</NORP> succour: such treason may be glorious; but the rebel who bravely ventures, has justly forfeited his life; nor should we blame a conqueror for destroying the enemies whom he can no longer trust.
 On the eighteenth of <DATE>June</DATE> the victorious sultan returned to Adrianople, and smiled at the base and hollow embassies of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes, who viewed their approaching ruin in the fall of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 He repeoples and adorns Constantinople.
 <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had been left naked and desolate, without a prince or a people.
 But she could not be despoiled of the incomparable situation which marks her for the metropolis of a great empire; and the genius of the place will ever triumph over the accidents of time and fortune.
 <PERSON>Boursa</PERSON> and Adrianople, the ancient seats of the Ottomans, sunk into provincial towns; and <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> established his own residence and that of his successors on the same commanding spot which had been chosen by Constantine.
 (80) The fortifications of Galata, which might afford a shelter to the Latins, were prudently destroyed; but the damage of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> cannon was soon repaired, and before the month of August great quantities of lime had been burnt for the restoration of the walls of the capital.
 As the entire property of the soil and buildings, whether public or private, or profane or sacred, was now transferred to the conqueror, he <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> separated a space of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> furlongs from the point of the triangle for the establishment of his seraglio or palace.
 It is here, in the bosom of luxury, that the Grand Signor (as he has been emphatically named by the Italians) appears to reign over <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia; but his person on the shores of the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> may not always be secure from the insults of a hostile navy.
 In the new character of a mosque, the cathedral of St.
 Sophia was endowed with an ample revenue, crowned with lofty minarets, and surrounded with groves and fountains for the devotion and refreshment of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> The same model was imitated in the jami, or royal mosques; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these was built by <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> himself, on the ruins of the church of the holy apostles and the tombs of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors.
 On the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> day after the conquest the grave of Abou Ayub, or Job, who had fallen in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> siege of the Arabs, was revealed in a vision; and it is before the sepulchre of the martyr that the new sultans are girded with the sword of empire.
 (81) <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> no longer appertains to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> historian; nor shall I enumerate the civil and religious edifices that were profaned or erected by its <NORP>Turkish</NORP> masters: the population was speedily renewed, and before the end of September <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> thousand families of <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> and <GPE>Romania</GPE> had obeyed the royal mandate, which enjoined them, under pain of death, to occupy their new habitations in the capital.
 The throne of <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> was guarded by the numbers and fidelity of his <NORP>Moslem</NORP> subjects; but his rational policy aspired to collect the remnant of the Greeks, and they returned in crowds as soon as they were assured of their lives, their liberties, and the free exercise of their religion.
 In the election and investiture of a patriarch the ceremonial of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court was revived and imitated.
 With a mixture of satisfaction and horror, they beheld the sultan on his throne, who delivered into the hands of <PERSON>Gennadius</PERSON> the crosier or pastoral staff, the symbol of his ecclesiastical office; who conducted the patriarch to the gate of the seraglio, presented him with a horse richly caparisoned, and directed the vizirs and bashaws to lead him to the palace which had been allotted for his residence.
 (82) The churches of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> were shared between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> religions: their limits were marked; and, till it was infringed by Selim, the grandson of Mohammed, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (83) enjoyed above <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> the benefit of this equal partition.
 Encouraged by the ministers of the divan, who wished to elude the fanaticism of the sultan, the <NORP>Christian</NORP> advocates presumed to allege that this division had been an act, not of generosity, but of justice; not a concession, but a compact; and that, if <CARDINAL>one-half</CARDINAL> of the city had been taken by storm, the other moiety had surrendered on the faith of a sacred capitulation.
 The original grant had indeed been consumed by fire; but the loss was supplied by the testimony of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> aged <PERSON>Janizaries</PERSON> who remembered the transaction, and their venal oaths are of more weight in the opinion of <PERSON>Cantemir</PERSON> than the positive and unanimous consent of the history of the times.
 (84) Extinction of the imperial families of <PERSON>Comnenus</PERSON> and Palaeologus.
 The remaining fragments of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> kingdom in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> I shall abandon to the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> arms; but the final extinction of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> last dynasties (85) which have reigned in <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> should terminate the decline and fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire in the East.
 The despots of the Morea, <PERSON>Demetrius</PERSON> and Thomas, (86) the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> surviving brothers of the name of PALAEOLOGUS, were astonished by the death of the emperor <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and the ruin of the monarchy.
 Hopeless of defence, they prepared, with the noble <NORP>Greeks</NORP> who adhered to their fortune, to seek a refuge in Italy, beyond the reach of the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> thunder.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> apprehensions were dispelled by the victorious sultan, who contented himself with a tribute of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> thousand ducats; and while his ambition explored the continent and the islands in search of prey, he indulged the <NORP>Morea</NORP> in a respite of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years.
 But this respite was a period of grief, discord, and misery.
 The hexamilion, the rampart of the Isthmus, so often raised and so often subverted, could not long be defended by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <NORP>Italian</NORP> archers: the keys of <GPE>Corinth</GPE> were seized by the Turks; they returned from their <DATE>summer</DATE> excursions with a train of captives and spoil, and the complaints of the injured <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were heard with indifference and disdain.
 The Albanians, a vagrant tribe of shepherds and robbers, filled the peninsula with rapine and murder: the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> despots implored the dangerous and humiliating aid of a neighbouring bashaw; and when he had quelled the revolt, his lessons inculcated the rule of their future conduct.
 Neither the ties of blood, nor the oaths which they repeatedly pledged in the communion and before the altar, nor the stronger pressure of necessity, could reconcile or suspend their domestic quarrels.
 They ravaged each other's patrimony with fire and sword; the alms and succours of the <LOC>West</LOC> were consumed in civil hostility, and their power was only exerted in savage and arbitrary executions.
 The distress and revenge of the weaker rival invoked theirsupreme lord; Loss of the Morea, A.
D.
 460; and, in the season of maturity and revenge, <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> declared himself the friend of Demetrius, and marched into the <NORP>Morea</NORP> with an irresistible force.
 When he had taken possession of Sparta, <PERSON>Demetrius</PERSON> sighed and obeyed; surrendered his daughter and his castles, followed to <PERSON>Adrianople</PERSON> his sovereign and son, and received for his own maintenance and that of his followers a city in Thrace, and the adjacent isles of Imbros, Lemnos, and Samothrace.
 He was joined the next year by a companion of misfortune, the last of the <NORP>COMNENIAN</NORP> race, who, after the taking of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by the Latins, had founded a new empire on the coast of the Black Sea.
 (87) In the progress of his <NORP>Anatolian</NORP> conquests, <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> invested with a fleet and arm the capital of David, who presumed to style himself emperor of Trebizond; (88) and the negotiation was comprised in a short and peremptory question.
 " Will you secure your life and treasures by resigning your kingdom? or had you rather forfeit your kingdom, your treasures, and your life?" of Trebizond, A.
D.
 1461.
 The feeble <PERSON>Comnenus</PERSON> was subdued by his own fears, and the example of a <NORP>Musulman</NORP> neighbour, the prince of Sinope, (89) who, on a similar summons, had yielded a fortified city with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> cannon and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> thousand soldiers.
 The capitulation of <PERSON>Trebizond</PERSON> was faithfully performed, and the emperor, with his family, was transported to a castle in Romania; but on a slight suspicion of corresponding with the <NORP>Persian</NORP> king, David, and the whole <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> race, were sacrificed to the jealousy or avarice of the conqueror.
 Nor could the name of father long protect the unfortunate <PERSON>Demetrius</PERSON> from exile and confiscation: his abject submission moved the pity and contempt of the sultan; his followers were transplanted to Constantinople, and his poverty was alleviated by a pension of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand aspers, till a monastic habit and a tardy death released <PERSON>Palaeologus</PERSON> from an earthly master.
 It is not easy to pronounce whether the servitude of Demetrius, or the exile of his brother Thomas,(90) be the most inglorious.
 On the conquest of the <NORP>Morea</NORP> the despot escaped to Corfu, and from thence to Italy, with some naked adherents: his name, his sufferings, and the head of the apostle St.
 Andrew, entitled him to the hospitality of the Vatican; and his misery was prolonged by a pension of six thousand ducats from the pope and cardinals.
 His <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, <PERSON>Andrew</PERSON> and Manuel, were educated in Italy; but the eldest, contemptible to his enemies and burdensome to his friends, was degraded by the baseness of his life and marriage.
 A title was his sole inheritance; and that inheritance he successively sold to the kings of <GPE>France</GPE> and Arragon.
 (91) During his transient prosperity, <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Eighth</ORDINAL> was ambitious of joining the empire of the <LOC>East</LOC> with the kingdom of Naples: in a public festival he assumed the appellation and the purple of Augustus; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> rejoiced, and the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> already trembled, at the approach of the <NORP>French</NORP> chivalry.
 (92) <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> Palaelogus, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> son, was tempted to revisit his native country: his return might be grateful, and could not be dangerous, to the Porte; he was maintained at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> in safety and ease, and an honourable train of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and <NORP>Moslems</NORP> attended him to the grave.
 If there be some animals of so generous a nature that they refuse to propagate in a domestic state, the last of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> race must be ascribed to an inferior kind; he accepted from the sultan's liberality <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> beautiful females, and his surviving son was lost in the habit and religion of a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> slave.
 Grief and terror of Europe, A.
D.
 1453.
 The importance of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was felt and magnified in its loss: the pontificate of <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> the Fifth, however peaceful and prosperous, was dishonoured by the fall of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire; and the grief and terror of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> revived, or seemed to revive, the old enthusiasm of the crusades.
 In <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most distant countries of the West, <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> duke of <GPE>Burgundy</GPE> entertained, at Lisle in Flanders, an assembly of his nobles; and the pompous pageants of the feast were skilfully adapted to their fancy and feelings.
(93) In the midst of the banquet a gigantic <NORP>Saracen</NORP> entered the hall, leading a fictitious elephant with a castle on his back: a matron in a mourning robe, the symbol of religion, was seen to issue from the castle: she deplored her oppression and accused the slowness of her champions: the principal herald of the golden fleece advanced, bearing on his fist a live pheasant, which, according to the rites of chivalry, he presented to the duke.
 At this extraordinary summons, Philip, a wise and aged prince, engaged his person and powers in the holy war against the Turks: his example was imitated by the barons and knights of the assembly: they swore to God the Virgin, the ladies, and the pheasant; and their particular vows were not less extravagant than the general sanction of their oath.
 But the performance was made to depend on some future and foreign contingency; and during <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years, till the last hour of his life, the duke of <GPE>Burgundy</GPE> might be scrupulously, and perhaps sincerely, on the eve of his departure.
 Had every breast glowed with the same ardour, had the union of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> corresponded with their bravery; had every country from <GPE>Sweden</GPE> (94) to <GPE>Naples</GPE> supplied a just proportion of cavalry and infantry, of men and money, it is indeed probable that <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> would have been delivered, and that the <NORP>Turks</NORP> might have been chased beyond the <PRODUCT>Hellespont</PRODUCT> or the Euphrates.
 But the secretary of the emperor, who composed every epistle, and attended every meeting, <PERSON>Aeneas</PERSON> Sylvius, (95) a statesman and orator, describes from his own experience the repugnant state and spirit of Christendom.
 Yet the same Aeneas, when he was raised to the papal throne, under the name of <PERSON>Pius</PERSON> the Second, devoted his life to the prosecution of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> war.
 In the council of <GPE>Mantua</GPE> he excited some sparks of a false or feeble enthusiasm; but when the pontiff appeared at Ancona, to embark in person with the troops, engagements vanished in excuses; a precise day was adjourned to an indefinite term; and his effective army consisted of some <NORP>German</NORP> pilgrims, whom he was obliged to disband with indulgences and alms.
 Regardless of futurity, his successors and the powers of <GPE>Italy</GPE> were involved in the schemes of present and domestic ambition; and the distance or proximity of each object determined in their eyes its apparent magnitude.
 A more enlarged view of their interest would have taught them to maintain a defensive and naval war against the common enemy; and the support of <PERSON>Scanderbeg</PERSON> and his brave <NORP>Albanians</NORP> might have prevented the subsequent invasion of the kingdom of Naples.
 Death of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> II.
 A.
D.
 1481, May 3, or July 2.
 The siege and sack of <GPE>Otranto</GPE> by the <NORP>Turks</NORP> diffused a general consternation; and Pope Sixtus was preparing to fly beyond the Alps, when the storm was instantly dispelled by the death of <PERSON>Mohammed</PERSON> the Second, in the fifty-first year of his age.
 (96) His lofty genius aspired to the conquest of Italy: he was possessed of a strong city and a capacious harbour; and the same reign might have been decorated with the trophies of the <ORG>NEW</ORG> and the ANCIENT ROME.
(97)
