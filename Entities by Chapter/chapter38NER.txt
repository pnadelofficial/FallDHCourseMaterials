Reign and Conversion of Clovis—His Victories over the Alemanni, Burgundians, and Visigoths—Establishment of the <NORP>French</NORP> Monarchy in Gaul—Laws of the Barbarians—State of the Romans—The <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> of Spain—Conquest of <GPE>Britain</GPE> by the SaxonsThe revolution of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> THE Gauls, (1) who impatiently supported the <NORP>Roman</NORP> yoke, received a memorable lesson from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the lieutenants of Vespasian, whose weighty sense has been refined and expressed by the genius of Tacitus.
 (2)This salutary advice was accepted, and this strange prediction was accomplished.
 In the space of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred years the hardy Gauls, who had encountered the arms of Caesar, were imperceptibly melted into the general mass of citizens and subjects: the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire was dissolved; and the <NORP>Germans</NORP> who had passed the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> fiercely contended for the possession of Gaul, and excited the contempt or abhorrence of its peaceful and polished inhabitants.
 With that conscious pride which the pre-eminence of knowledge and luxury seldom fails to inspire, they derided the hairy and gigantic savages of the North; their rustic manners, dissonant joy, voracious appetite, and their horrid appearance, equally disgusting to the sight and to the smell.
 The liberal studies were still cultivated in the schools of <PERSON>Autun</PERSON> and Bordeaux, and the language of <PERSON>Cicero</PERSON> and <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> was familiar to the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> youth.
 Their ears were astonished by the harsh and unknown sounds of the <NORP>Germanic</NORP> dialect, and they ingeniously lamented that the trembling muses fled from the harmony of a <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> lyre.
 The <NORP>Gauls</NORP> were endowed with all the advantages of art and nature, but, as they wanted courage to defend them, they were justly condemned to obey, and even to flatter, the victorious barbarians by whose clemency they held their precarious fortunes and their lives.
 (4)Euric, king of the Visigoths, A.
D.
 476-485.
 As soon as <PERSON>Odoacer</PERSON> had extinguished the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, he sought the friendship of the most powerful of the barbarians.
 The new sovereign of <GPE>Italy</GPE> resigned to Euric, king of the Visigoths, all the <NORP>Roman</NORP> conquests beyond the Alps, as far as the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and the Ocean; (5) and the senate might confirm this liberal gift with some ostentation of power, and without any real loss of revenue or dominion.
 The lawful pretensions of <NORP>Euric</NORP> were justified by ambition and success, and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation might aspire under his command to the monarchy of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and <GPE>Gaul.
</GPE> <GPE>Arles</GPE> and <GPE>Marseilles</GPE> surrendered to his arms: he oppressed the freedom of Auvergne, and the bishop condescended to purchase his recall from exile by a tribute of just but reluctant praise.
 <PERSON>Sidonius</PERSON> waited before the gates of the palace among a crowd of ambassadors and suppliants, and their various business at the court of <GPE>Bordeaux</GPE> attested the power and the renown of the king of the Visigoths.
 The <PERSON>Heruli</PERSON> of the distant ocean, who painted their naked bodies with its caerulean colour, implored his protection; and the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> respected the maritime provinces of a prince who was destitute of any naval force.
 The tall <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> submitted to his authority; nor did he restore the captive <NORP>Franks</NORP> till he had imposed on that fierce nation the terms of an unequal peace.
 The <NORP>Vandals</NORP> of <LOC>Africa</LOC> cultivated his useful friendship, and the <EVENT>Ostrogoths</EVENT> of <PERSON>Pannonia</PERSON> were supported by his powerful aid against the oppression of the neighbouring Huns.
 The <LOC>North</LOC> (such are the lofty strains of the poet) was agitated or appeased by the nod of Euric, the great king of <GPE>Persia</GPE> consulted the oracle of the West, and the aged god of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> was protected by the swelling genius of the Garonne.
 (6) The fortune of nations has often depended on accidents; and <GPE>France</GPE> may ascribe her greatness to the premature death of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king at a time when his son <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was a helpless infant, and his adversary <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> (7) an ambitious and valiant youth.
Clovis, king of the Franks, A.
D.
 481-511.
 While Childeric, the father of Clovis, lived an exile in Germany, he was hospitably entertained by the queen as well as by the king of the Thuringians.
 After his restoration <PERSON>Bafina</PERSON> escaped from her husband's bed to the arms of her lover, freely declaring that, if she had known a man wiser, stronger, or more beautiful than Childeric, that man should have been the object of her preference.
 (8) <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> was the offspring of this voluntary union, and when he was no more than <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> years of age he succeeded, by his father's death, to the command of the <NORP>Salian</NORP> tribe.
 The narrow limits of his kingdom (9) were confined to the island of the Batavians, with the ancient dioceses of <GPE>Tournay</GPE> and Arras; (10) and at the baptism of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> the number of his warriors could not exceed five thousand.
 The kindred tribes of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> who had seated themselves along the <NORP>Belgic</NORP> rivers, the Scheldt, the Meuse, the Moselle, and the Rhine, were governed by their independent kings of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> race the equals, the allies, and sometimes the enemies, of the <NORP>Salic</NORP> prince.
 But the Germans, who obeyed in peace the hereditary jurisdiction of their chiefs, were free to follow the standard of a popular and victorious general; and the superior merit of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> attracted the respect and allegiance of the national confederacy.
 When he <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> took the field, he had neither gold and silver in his coffers, nor wine and corn in his magazines; (11) but he imitated the example of Caesar, who in the same country had acquired wealth by the sword, and purchased soldiers with the fruits of conquest.
 After each successful battle or expedition the spoils were accumulated in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> common mass; every warrior received his proportionable share, and the royal prerogative submitted to the equal regulations of military law.
 The untamed spirit of the barbarians was taught to acknowledge the advantages of regular discipline.
 (12) At the <DATE>annual</DATE> review of the month of March their arms were diligently inspected, and when they traversed a peaceful territory they were prohibited from touching a blade of grass.
 The justice of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> was inexorable, and his careless or disobedient soldiers were punished with instant death.
 It would be superfluous to praise the valour of a Frank, but the valour of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> was directed by cool and consummate prudence.
 (13) In all his transactions with mankind he calculated the weight of interest, of passion, and of opinion; and his measures were sometimes adapted to the sanguinary manners of the Germans, and sometimes moderated by the milder genius of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Christianity.
 He was intercepted in the career of victory, since he died in the forty-fifth year of his age: but he had already accomplished, in a reign of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, the establishment of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy in Gaul.
His victory of Syagrius, A.
D.
 486.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exploit of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> was the defeat of Syagrius, the son of Aegidius, and the public quarrel might on this occasion be inflamed by private resentment.
 The glory of the father still insulted the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> race; the power of the son might excite the jealous ambition of the king of the Franks.
 <PERSON>Syagrius</PERSON> inherited, as a patrimonial estate, the city and diocese of Soissons: the desolate remnant of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Belgic, <NORP>Rheims</NORP> and Troyes, <PERSON>Beauvais</PERSON> and Amiens, would naturally submit to the count or patrician; (14) and after the dissolution of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire he might reign with the title, or at least with the authority, of king of the Romans.
 (15) As a Roman, he had been educated in the liberal studies of rhetoric and jurisprudence; but he was engaged by accident and policy in the familiar use of the <NORP>Germanic</NORP> idiom.
 The independent barbarians resorted to the tribunal of a stranger who possessed the singular talent of explaining, in their native tongue, the dictates of reason and equity.
 The diligence and affability of their judge rendered him popular, the impartial wisdom of his decrees obtained their voluntary obedience, and the reign of <PERSON>Syagrius</PERSON> over the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> seemed to revive the original institution of civil society.
 (16) In the midst of these peaceful occupations <PERSON>Syagrius</PERSON> received, and boldly accepted, the hostile defiance of Clovis, who challenged his rival in the spirit, and almost in the language of chivalry, to appoint the day and the field (17) of battle.
 In the time of Caesar, <PRODUCT>Soissons</PRODUCT> would have poured forth a body of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand horse; and such an army might have been plentifully supplied with shields, cuirasses, and military engines from the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> arsenals or manufactures of the city.
 (18) But the courage and numbers of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> youth were long since exhausted, and the loose bands of volunteers or mercenaries who marched under the standard of <PERSON>Syagrius</PERSON> were incapable of contending with the national valour of the Franks.
 It would be ungenerous, without some more accurate knowledge of his strength and resources, to condemn the rapid flight of Syagrius, who escaped after the loss of a battle to the distant court of Toulouse.
 The feeble minority of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> could not assist or protect an unfortunate fugitive; the pusillanimous (19) <NORP>Goths</NORP> were intimidated by the menaces of Clovis: and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> king, after a short confinement, was delivered into the hands of the executioner.
 The <NORP>Belgic</NORP> cities surrendered to the king of the Franks, and his dominions were enlarged towards the east by the ample diocese of Tongres, (20) which <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> subdued in the tenth year of his reign.
Defeat and submission of the Alemanni, A.
D.
 496.
 The name of the <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> has been absurdly derived from their imaginary settlement on the banks of the <NORP>Leman</NORP> lake.
 (21) That fortunate district, from the lake to <GPE>Avenche</GPE> and Mount Jura, was occupied by the Burgundians.
 (22) The northern parts of <GPE>Helvetia</GPE> had indeed been subdued by the ferocious Alemanni, who destroyed with their own hands the fruits of their conquest.
 A province, improved and adorned by the arts of Rome, was again reduced to a savage wilderness, and some vestige of the stately <GPE>Vindonissa</GPE> may still be discovered in the fertile and populous valley of the Aar.
 (23) From the source of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to its conflux with the <FAC>Main</FAC> and the Moselle, the formidable swarms of the <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> commanded either side of the river by the right of ancient possession or recent victory.
 They had spread themselves into <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> over the modern provinces of <GPE>Alsace</GPE> and Lorraine; and their bold invasion of the kingdom of <GPE>Cologne</GPE> summoned the <NORP>Salic</NORP> prince to the defence of his <NORP>Ripuarian</NORP> allies.
 <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> encountered the invaders of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> in the plain of Tolbiac, about twenty-four miles from Cologne, and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fiercest nations of <GPE>Germany</GPE> were mutually animated by the memory of past exploits and the prospect of future greatness.
 The <NORP>Franks</NORP> after an obstinate struggle gave way, and the Alemanni, raising a shout of victory, impetuously pressed their retreat.
 But the battle was restored by the valour, the conduct, and perhaps by the piety, of Clovis; and the event of the bloody day decided for ever the alternative of empire or servitude.
 The last king of the <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> was slain in the field, and his people were slaughtered and pursued till they threw down their arms and yielded to the mercy of the conqueror.
 Without discipline it was impossible for them to rally: they had contemptuously demolished the walls and fortifications which might have protected their distress; and they a were followed into the heart of their forests by an enemy not less active or intrepid than themselves.
 The great <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> congratulated the victory of Clovis, whose sister <PERSON>Albofleda</PERSON> the king of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had lately married; but he mildly interceded with his brother in favour of the suppliants and fugitives who had implored his protection.
 The <NORP>Gallic</NORP> territories which were possessed by the <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> became the prize of their conqueror; and the haughty nation, invincible or rebellious to the arms of Rome, acknowledged the sovereignty of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> kings, who graciously permitted them to enjoy their peculiar manners and institutions under the government of official, and, at length, of hereditary dukes.
 After the conquest of the <NORP>Western</NORP> provinces, the <NORP>Franks</NORP> alone maintained their ancient habitations beyond the Rhine.
 They gradually subdued and civilised the exhausted countries as far as the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and the mountains of Bohemia, and the peace of <LOC>Europe</LOC> was secured by the obedience of Germany.
 (24)Conversion of Clovis, A.
D.
 496.
 Till the thirtieth year of his age <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> continued to worship the gods of his ancestors.
 (25) His disbelief, or rather disregard of Christianity, might encourage him to pillage with less remorse the churches of an hostile territory: but his subjects of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> enjoyed the free exercise of religious worship, and the bishops entertained a more favourable hope of the idolater than of the heretics.
 The <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> prince had contracted a fortunate alliance with the fair Clotilda, the niece of the king of Burgundy, who in the midst of an <NORP>Arian</NORP> court was educated in the profession of the catholic faith.
 It was her interest as well as her duty to achieve the conversion (26) of a <NORP>Pagan</NORP> husband; and <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> insensibly listened to the voice of love and religion.
 He consented (perhaps such terms had been previously stipulated) to the baptism of his eldest on; and though the sudden death of the infant excited some superstitious fears, he was persuaded a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time to repeat the dangerous experiment.
 In the distress of the battle of Tolbiac, <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> loudly invoked the God of <ORG>Clotilda</ORG> and the Christians; and victory disposed him to hear with respectful gratitude the eloquent (27) Remigius, ((28) bishop of Rheims, who forcibly displayed the temporal and spiritual advantages of his conversion.
 The king declared himself satisfied of the truth of the catholic faith and the political reasons which might have suspended his public profession were removed by the devout or loyal acclamations of the Franks, who showed themselves alike prepared to follow their heroic leader to the field of battle or to the baptismal font.
 The important ceremony was performed in the cathedral of <NORP>Rheims</NORP> with every circumstance of magnificence and solemnity hat could impress an awful sense of religion on he minds of its rude proselytes.
 (29) The new <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was immediately baptised with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand of his warlike subjects, and their example was imitated by the remainder of the gentle barbarians, who, in obedience to the victorious prelate, adored the cross which they had burnt, and burnt the idols which they had formerly adored.
 (30) The mind of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> was susceptible of transient fervour: he was exasperated by the pathetic tale of the passion and death of Christ; and instead of weighing the salutary consequences of that mysterious sacrifice, he exclaimed with indiscreet fury, "Had I been present at the head of my valiant Franks, I would have revenged his injuries.
" (31) But the savage conqueror of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was incapable of examining the proofs of a religion which depends on the laborious investigation of historic evidence and speculative theology.
 He was still more incapable of feeling the mild influence of the Gospel, which persuades and purifies the heart of a genuine convert.
 His ambitious reign was a perpetual violation of moral and <NORP>Christian</NORP> duties: his hands were stained with blood in peace as well as in war; and, as soon as <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> had dismissed a synod of the <NORP>Gallician</NORP> church, he calmly assassinated all the princes of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> race.
 (32) Yet the king of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> might sincerely worship the <NORP>Christian</NORP> God as a being more excellent and powerful than his national deities; and the signal deliverance and victory of <PERSON>Tolbiac</PERSON> encouraged <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> to confide in the future protection of the Lord of Hosts.
 Martin, the most popular of the saints, had filled the <NORP>Western</NORP> world with the fame of those miracles which were incessantly performed at his holy sepulchre of Tours.
 His visible or invisible aid promoted the cause of a liberal and orthodox prince; and the profane remark of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> himself, that St.
 <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> was an expensive friend, (33) need not be interpreted as the symptom of any permanent or rational scepticism.
 But earth as well as heaven rejoiced in the conversion of the Franks.
 On the memorable day when <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> ascended from the baptismal font, he alone in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world deserved the name and prerogatives of a catholic king.
 The emperor <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> entertained some dangerous errors concerning the nature of the divine incarnation; and the barbarians of Italy, Africa, Spain, and <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> were involved in the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy.
 The eldest, or rather the only son of the church, was acknowledged by the clergy as their lawful sovereign or glorious deliverer; and the arms of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> were strenuously supported by the zeal and favour of the catholic faction.
 (34) Submission of the <NORP>Amoricans</NORP> and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops, A.
D.
 497 etc.
 Under the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire the wealth and jurisdiction of the bishops, their sacred character and perpetual office, their numerous dependents, popular eloquence, and provincial assemblies had rendered them always respectable, and sometimes dangerous.
 Their influence was augmented with the progress of superstition; and the establishment of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy may, in some degree, be ascribed to the firm alliance of an hundred prelates, who reigned in the discontented or independent cities of <GPE>Gaul.
</GPE> The slight foundations of the <NORP>Armorican</NORP> republic had been repeatedly shaken or overthrown; but the same people still guarded their domestic freedom; asserted the dignity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name; and bravely resisted the predatory inroads and regular attacks of Clovis, who laboured to extend his conquests from the <LOC>Seine</LOC> to the Loire.
 Their successful opposition introduced an equal and honourable union.
 The <NORP>Franks</NORP> esteemed the valour of the Armoricans; (35) and the <NORP>Armoricans</NORP> were reconciled by the religion of the Franks.
 The military force which had been stationed for the defence of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> consisted of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred different bands of cavalry or infantry; and these troops, while they assumed the title and privileges of <NORP>Roman</NORP> soldiers, were renewed by an incessant supply of the barbarian youth.
 The extreme fortifications and scattered fragments of the empire were still defended by their hopeless courage.
 But their retreat was intercepted, and their communication was impracticable: they were abandoned by the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes of Constantinople, and they piously disclaimed all connection with the <NORP>Arian</NORP> usurpers of <GPE>Gaul.
</GPE> They accepted, without shame or reluctance, the generous capitulation which was proposed by a catholic hero; and the spurious or legitimate progeny of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions was distinguished in the succeeding age by their arms, their ensigns, and their peculiar dress and institutions.
 But the national strength was increased by these powerful and voluntary accessions; and the neighbouring kingdoms dreaded the numbers as well as the spirit of the Franks.
 The reduction of the northern provinces of Gaul, instead of being decided by the chance of a single battle, appears to have been slowly effected by the gradual operation of war and treaty; and <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> acquired each object of his ambition by such efforts or such concessions as were adequate to its real value.
 His savage character and the virtues of Henry IV.
 suggest the most opposite ideas of human nature; yet some resemblance may be found in the situation of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes who conquered <GPE>France</GPE> by their valour, their policy, and the merits of a seasonable conversion.
 (36) The <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> war, A.
D.
 499.
 The kingdom of the Burgundians, which was defined by the course of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Gallic</NORP> rivers, the <LOC>Saone</LOC> and the Rhone, extended from the forest of <LOC>Vosges</LOC> to the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and the sea of Marseilles.
 (37) The sceptre was in the hands of <PERSON>Gundobald</PERSON> That valiant and ambitious prince had reduced the number of royal candidates by the death of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of whom was the father of Clotilda; (38) but his imperfect prudence still permitted Godegesil, the youngest of his brothers to possess the dependent principality of Geneva.
 The <NORP>Arian</NORP> monarch was justly alarmed by the satisfaction and the hopes which seemed to animate his clergy and people after the conversion of Clovis; and <PERSON>Gundobald</PERSON> convened at <GPE>Lyons</GPE> an assembly of his bishops, to reconcile, if it were possible, their religious and political discontents.
 A vain conference was agitated between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions.
 The <NORP>Arians</NORP> upbraided the catholics with the worship of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> Gods: the catholics defended their cause by theological distinctions; and the usual arguments, objections, and replies were reverberated with obstinate clamour, till the king revealed his secret apprehensions by an abrupt but decisive question, which he addressed to the orthodox bishops: The answer of Avitus, bishop of Vienne, who spoke in the name of his brethren, was delivered with the voice and countenance of an angel.
The king of Burgundy, who was not prepared to accept the condition which the catholics considered as essential to the treaty, delayed and dismissed the ecclesiastical conference, after reproaching his bishops, that Clovis, their friend and proselyte, had privately tempted the allegiance of his brother.
 (39) Victory of Clovis, A.
D.
 500.
 The allegiance of his brother was already seduced; and the obedience of Godegesil, who joined the royal standard with the troops of Geneva, more effectually promoted the success of the conspiracy.
 While the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> contended with equal valour, his seasonable desertion decided the event of the battle; and as <PERSON>Gundobald</PERSON> was faintly supported by the disaffected Gauls, he yielded to the arms of Clovis, and hastily retreated from the field, which appears to have been situate between <GPE>Langres</GPE> and Dijon.
 He distrusted the strength of Dijon, a quadrangular fortress, encompassed by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rivers and by a wall <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> feet high and <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> thick, with <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> gates and <CARDINAL>thirty-three</CARDINAL> towers: (40) he abandoned to the pursuit of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> the important cities of <GPE>Lyons</GPE> and Vienne, and <PERSON>Gundobald</PERSON> still fled with precipitation till he had reached Avignon, at the distance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> miles from the field of battle.
 A long siege and an artful negotiation admonished the king of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> of the danger and difficulty of his enterprise.
 He imposed a tribute on the <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> prince, compelled him to pardon and reward his brother's treachery, and proudly returned to his own dominions with the spoils and captives of the southern provinces.
 This splendid triumph was soon clouded by the intelligence that <PERSON>Gundobald</PERSON> had violated his recent obligations, and that the unfortunate Godegesil, who was left at <GPE>Vienne</GPE> with a garrison of five thousand Franks, (41) had been besieged, surprised, and massacred by his inhuman brother.
 Such an outrage might have exasperated the patience of the most peaceful sovereign; yet the conqueror of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> dissembled the injury, released the tribute, and accepted the alliance and military service of the king of Burgundy.
 <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> no longer possessed those advantages which had assured the success of the preceding war; and his rival, instructed by adversity, had found new resources in the affections of his people.
 The <NORP>Gauls</NORP> or <NORP>Romans</NORP> applauded the mild and impartial laws of Gundobald, which almost raised them to the same level with their conquerors.
 The bishops were reconciled and flattered by the hopes which he artfully suggested of his approaching conversion; and though he eluded their accomplishment to the last moment of his life, his moderation secured the peace and suspended the ruin of the kingdom of Burgundy.
 (42) Final conquest of Burgundy, by the Franks, A.
D.
 532.
 I am impatient to pursue the final ruin of that kingdom, which was accomplished under the reign of Sigismond, the son of Gundobald.
 The catholic <PERSON>Sigismond</PERSON> has acquired the honours of a saint and martyr; (43) but the hands of the royal saint were stained with the blood of his innocent son, whom he inhumanly sacrificed to the pride and resentment of a stepmother.
 He soon discovered his error, and bewailed the irreparable loss.
 While <PERSON>Sigismond</PERSON> embraced the corpse of the unfortunate youth, he received a severe admonition from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his attendants: "It is not his situation, O king! it is thine which deserves pity and lamentation.
" The reproaches of a guilty conscience were alleviated, however by his liberal donations to the monastery of Agaunum, or St.
 Maurice, in <GPE>Vallais</GPE> which he himself had founded in honour of the imaginary martyrs of the <NORP>Thebaean</NORP> legion.
 (44) A full chorus of perpetual psalmody was instituted by the pious king; he assiduously practised the austere devotion of the monks; and it was his humble prayer that Heaven would inflict in this world the punishment of his sins.
 His prayer was heard: the avengers were at hand; and the provinces of <GPE>Burgundy</GPE> were overwhelmed by an army of victorious Franks.
 After the event of an unsuccessful battle, Sigismond, who wished to protract his life that he might prolong his penance, concealed himself in the desert in a religious habit till he was discovered and betrayed by his subjects, who solicited the favour of their new masters.
 The captive monarch, with his wife and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> children, was transported to Orleans, and buried alive in a deep well by the stern command of the sons of Clovis, whose cruelty might derive some excuse from the maxims and examples of their barbarous age.
 Their ambition, which urged them to achieve the conquest of Burgundy, was inflamed or disguised by filial piety: and Clotilda, whose sanctity did not consist in the forgiveness of injuries, pressed them to revenge her father's death on the family of his assassin.
 The rebellious Burgundians, for they attempted to break their chains, were still permitted to enjoy their national laws under the obligation of tribute and military service; and the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> princes peaceably reigned over a kingdom whose glory and greatness had been <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> overthrown by the arms of Clovis.
 (45)The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war, A.
D.
 507.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> victory of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> had insulted the honour of the Goths.
 They viewed his rapid progress with jealousy and terror; and the youthful fame of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was oppressed by the more potent genius of his rival.
 Some disputes inevitably arose on the edge of their contiguous dominions; and after the delays of fruitless negotiation a personal interview of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> kings was proposed and accepted.
 This conference of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> was held in a small island of the Laire, near Amboise.
 They embraced, familiarly conversed, and feasted together and separated with the warmest professions of peace and brotherly love.
 But their apparent confidence concealed a dark suspicion of hostile and treacherous designs; and their mutual complaints solicited, eluded, and disclaimed a final arbitration.
 At Paris, which he already considered as his royal seat, <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> declared to an assembly of the princes and warriors the pretence and the motive of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war.
The Franks, who were inspired by hereditary valour and recent zeal, applauded the generous design of their monarch; expressed their resolution to conquer or die, since death and conquest would be equally profitable; and solemnly protested that they would never shave their beards till victory should absolve them from that inconvenient vow.
 The enterprise was promoted by the public or private exhortations of Clotilda.
 She reminded her husband how effectually some pious foundation would propitiate the Deity and his servants: and the <NORP>Christian</NORP> hero, darting his battleaxe with a skilful and nervous hand, This ostentatious piety confirmed and justified the attachment of the Catholics, with whom he secretly corresponded; and their devout wishes were gradually ripened into a formidable conspiracy.
 The people of <PERSON>Aquitain</PERSON> was alarmed by the indiscreet reproaches of their <NORP>Gothic</NORP> tyrants, who justly accused them of preferring the dominion of the Franks; and their zealous adherent Quintianus, bishop of Rodez, (48) preached more forcibly in his exile than in his diocese.
 To resist these foreign and domestic enemies, who were fortified by the alliance of the Burgundians, <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> collected his troops, far more numerous than the military powers of Clovis.
 The <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> resumed the exercise of arms, which they had neglected in a long and luxurious peace; (49) a select band of valiant and robust slaves attended their masters to the field; (50) and the cities of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> were compelled to furnish their doubtful and reluctant aid.
 Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, who reigned in Italy, had laboured to maintain the tranquillity of Gaul; and he assumed, or affected, for that purpose the impartial character of a mediator.
 But the sagacious monarch dreaded the rising empire of Clovis, and he was firmly engaged to support the national and religious cause of the Goths.
Victory of Clovis, A.
D.
 507.
 The accidental or artificial prodigies which adorned the expedition of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> were accepted, by a superstitious age, as the manifest declaration of the Divine favour.
 He marched from Paris, and as he proceeded with decent reverence through the holy diocese of Tours, his anxiety tempted him to consult the shrine of St Martin, the sanctuary, and the oracle of <GPE>Gaul.
</GPE> His messengers were instructed to remark the words of the <WORK_OF_ART>Psalm</WORK_OF_ART> which should happen to be chanted at the precise moment when they entered the church.
 Those words most fortunately expressed the valour and victory of the champions of Heaven, and the application was easily transferred to the new Joshua, the new <PERSON>Gideon</PERSON> who went forth to battle against the enemies of the Lord.
 (51) <GPE>Orleans</GPE> secured to the <NORP>Franks</NORP> a bridge on the Loire; but, at the distance of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> miles from Poitiers, their progress was intercepted by an extraordinary swell of the river <GPE>Vigenna</GPE> or Vienne; and the opposite banks were covered by the encampment of the Visigoths.
 Delay must be always dangerous to barbarians, who consume the country through which they march; and had <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> possessed leisure and materials, it might have been impracticable to construct a bridge, or to force a passage, in the face of a superior enemy.
 But the affectionate peasants, who were impatient to welcome their deliverer, could easily betray some unknown or unguarded ford: the merit of the discovery was enhanced by the useful interposition of fraud or fiction; and a white hart, of singular size and beauty, appeared to guide and animate the march of the catholic army.
 The counsels of the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> were irresolute and distracted.
 A crowd of impatient warriors, presumptuous in their strength, and disdaining to fly before the robbers of Germany, excited <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> to assert in arms the name and blood of the conqueror of Rome.
 The advice of the graver chieftains pressed him to elude the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ardour of the Franks; and to expect, in the southern provinces of Gaul, the veteran and victorious Ostrogoths, whom the king of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had already sent to his assistance.
 The decisive moments were wasted in idle deliberation; the <NORP>Goths</NORP> too hastily abandoned, perhaps, an advantageous post; and the opportunity of a secure retreat was lost by their slow and disorderly motions.
 After <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> had passed the ford, as it is still named, of the Hart, he advanced with bold and hasty steps to prevent the escape of the enemy.
 His nocturnal march was directed by a flaming meteor suspended in the air above the cathedral of Poitiers; and this signal, which might be previously concerted with the orthodox successor of St.
 Hilary, was compared to the column of fire that guided the <NORP>Israelites</NORP> in the desert.
 At the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> hour of the day, about <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> miles beyond Poitiers, <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> overtook, and instantly attacked, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army, whose defeat was already prepared by terror and confusion.
 Yet they rallied in their extreme distress, and the martial youths, who had clamorously demanded the battle, refused to survive the ignominy of flight.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> kings encountered each other in single combat <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> fell by the hand of his rival; and the victorious <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> was saved, by the goodness of his cuirass and the vigour of his horse, from the spears of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> desperate Goths, who furiously rode against him to revenge the death of their sovereign.
 The vague expression of a mountain of the slain serves to indicate a cruel, though indefinite, slaughter; but <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> has carefully observed that his valiant countryman Apollinaris, the son of Sidonius, lost his life at the head of the nobles of Auvergne.
 Perhaps these suspected catholics had been maliciously exposed to the blind assault of the enemy; and perhaps the influence of religion was superseded by personal attachment or military honour.
 (52) Conquest of <PERSON>Aquitain</PERSON> by the Franks, A.
D.
 508.
 Such is the empire of <WORK_OF_ART>Fortune</WORK_OF_ART> (if we may still disguise our ignorance under that popular name), that it is almost equally difficult to foresee the events of war, or to explain their various consequences.
 A bloody and complete victory has sometimes yielded no more than the possession of the field; and the loss of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> thousand men has sometimes been sufficient to destroy, in a single day, the work of ages.
 The decisive battle of <GPE>Poitiers</GPE> was followed by the conquest of Aquitain.
 <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> had left behind him an infant son, a bastard competitor, factious nobles and a disloyal people and the remaining forces of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were oppressed by the general consternation, or opposed to each other in civil discord The victorious king of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> proceeded without delay to the siege of Angouleme.
 At the sound of his trumpets the walls of the city imitated the example of Jericho, and instantly fell to the ground; a splendid miracle, which may be reduced to the supposition that some clerical engineers had secretly undermined the foundations of the rampart.
 (53) At Bordeaux, which had submitted without resistance, <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> established his <DATE>winter</DATE> quarters and his prudent economy transported from <GPE>Toulouse</GPE> the royal treasures, which were deposited in the capital of the monarchy.
 The conqueror penetrated as far as the confines of Spain; (54) restored the honours of the catholic church; fixed in <PERSON>Aquitain</PERSON> a colony of <NORP>Franks</NORP> (55) and delegated to his lieutenants the easy task of subduing or extirpating the nation of the Visigoths.
 But the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> were protected by the wise and powerful monarch of Italy.
 While the balance was still equal, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> had perhaps delayed the march of the Ostrogoths; but their strenuous efforts successfully resisted the ambition of Clovis; and the army of the Franks, and their <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> allies, was compelled to raise the siege of Arles, with the loss, as it is said, of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 These vicissitudes inclined the fierce spirit of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> to acquiesce in an advantageous treaty of peace.
 The <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> were suffered to retain the possession of Septimania, a narrow tract of seacoast, from the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> to the Pyrenees; but the ample province of Aquitain, from those mountains to the Loire, was indissolubly united to the kingdom of France.
 (56) Consulship of Clovis, A.
D.
 510.
 After the success of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war, <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> accepted the honours of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> consulship.
 The emperor <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> ambitiously bestowed on the most powerful rival of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> the title and ensigns of that eminent dignity; yet, from some unknown cause, the name of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> has not been inscribed in the <NORP>Fasti</NORP> either of the <LOC>East</LOC> or West.
 (57) On the solemn day, the monarch of Gaul, placing a diadem on his head, was invested, in the church of St.
 Martin, with a purple tunic and mantle.
 From thence he proceeded on horseback to the cathedral of Tours; and, as he passed through the streets, profusely scattered, with his own hand, a donative of gold and silver to the joyful multitude, who incessantly repeated their acclamations of Consul and Augustus.
 The actual or legal authority of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> could not receive any new accessions from the consular dignity.
 It was a name, a shadow, an empty pageant; and if the conqueror had been instructed to claim the ancient prerogatives of that high office, they must have expired with the period of its <DATE>annual</DATE> duration.
 But the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were disposed to revere, in the person of their master, that antique title which the emperors condescended to assume: the barbarian himself seemed to contract a sacred obligation to respect the majesty of the republic; and the successors of Theodosius, by soliciting his friendship, tacitly forgave, and almost ratified, the usurpation of Gaul.
Final establishment of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy in Gaul, A.
D.
 536.
 Twenty-five years after the death of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> this important concession was more formally declared in a treaty between his sons and the emperor Justinian.
 The <EVENT>Ostrogoths</EVENT> of Italy, unable to defend their distant acquisitions, had resigned to the <NORP>Franks</NORP> the cities of <GPE>Arles</GPE> and Marseilles: of Arles, still adorned with the seat of a <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, and of Marseilles, enriched by the advantages of trade and navigation.
 (58) This transaction was confirmed by the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> authority; and Justinian, generously yielding to the <NORP>Franks</NORP> the sovereignty of the countries beyond the Alps, which they already possessed, absolved the provincials from their allegiance; and established on a more lawful, though not more solid, foundation, the throne of the Merovingians.
 (59) From that era they enjoyed the right of celebrating at <GPE>Arles</GPE> the games of the circus; and by a singular privilege, which was denied even to the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch, the gold coin, impressed with their name and image, obtained a legal currency in the empire.
 (60) A <NORP>Greek</NORP> historian of that age has praised the private and public virtues of the Franks, with a partial enthusiasm which cannot be sufficiently justified by their domestic annals.
 (61) He celebrates their politeness and urbanity, their regular government, and orthodox religion; and boldly asserts that these barbarians could be distinguished only by their dress and language from the subjects of Rome.
 Perhaps the <NORP>Franks</NORP> already displayed the social disposition, and lively graces, which, in every age, have disguised their vices, and sometimes concealed their intrinsic merit.
 Perhaps Agathias, and the Greeks, were dazzled by the rapid progress of their arms, and the splendour of their empire.
 Since the conquest of Burgundy, Gaul, except the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> province of Septimania, was subject, in its whole extent, to the sons of Clovis.
 They had extinguished the <NORP>German</NORP> kingdom of Thuringia, and their vague dominion penetrated beyond the Rhine, into the heart of their native forests.
 The <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> and Bavarians, who had occupied the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces of <GPE>Rhaetia</GPE> and Noricum, to the south of the Danube, confessed themselves the humble vassals of the Franks; and the feeble barrier of the <LOC>Alps</LOC> was incapable of resisting their ambition.
 When the last survivor of the sons of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> united the inheritance and conquests of the Merovingians, his kingdom extended far beyond the limits of modern France.
 Yet modern France, such has been the progress of arts and policy, far surpasses, in wealth, populousness, and power, the spacious but savage realms of <PERSON>Clotaire</PERSON> or Dagobert.
 (62) Political Controversy.
 The Franks, or French, are the only people of <LOC>Europe</LOC> who can deduce a perpetual succession from the conquerors of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 But their conquest of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was followed by <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> centuries of anarchy and ignorance.
 On the revival of learning, the students who had been formed in the schools of <GPE>Athens</GPE> and <GPE>Rome</GPE> disdained their barbarian ancestors; and a long period elapsed before patient labour could provide the requisite materials to satisfy, or rather to excite, the curiosity of more enlightened times.
 (63) At length the eye of criticism and philosophy was directed to the antiquities of <GPE>France</GPE> but even philosophers have been tainted by the contagion of prejudice and passion.
 The most extreme and exclusive systems, of the personal servitude of the Gauls, or of their voluntary and equal alliance with the Franks, have been rashly conceived, and obstinately defended; and the intemperate disputants have accused each other of conspiring against the prerogative of the crown, the dignity of the nobles, or the freedom of the people.
 Yet the sharp conflict has usefully exercised the adverse powers of learning and genius; and each antagonist, alternately vanquished and victorious, has extirpated some ancient errors, and established some interesting truths.
 An impartial stranger, instructed by their discoveries, their disputes, and even their faults, may describe, from the same original materials, the state of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provincials, after <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had submitted to the arms and laws of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> kings.
 (64) Laws of the Barbarian.
 The rudest, or the most servile, condition of human society, is regulated however by some fixed and general rules.
 When <PERSON>Tacitus</PERSON> surveyed the primitive simplicity of the Germans, he discovered some permanent maxims, or customs, of public and private life, which were preserved by faithful tradition till the introduction of the art of writing, and of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> tongue.
 (65) Before the election of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> kings, the most powerful tribe, or nation, of the Franks, appointed <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> venerable chieftains to compose the <NORP>Salic</NORP> laws; (66) and their labours were examined and approved in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> successive assemblies of the people.
 After the baptism of Clovis, he reformed several articles that appeared incompatible with Christianity: the <NORP>Salic</NORP> law was again amended by his sons; and at length, under the reign of Dagobert, the code was revised and promulgated in its actual form, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred years after the establishment of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy.
 Within the same period, the customs of the <NORP>Ripua'rians</NORP> were transcribed and published; and <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> himself, the legislator of his age and country, had accurately studied the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> national laws which still prevailed among the Franks.
 (67) The same care was extended to their vassals and the rude institutions of the <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> and <NORP>Bavarians</NORP> were diligently compiled and ratified by the supreme authority of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> kings.
 The <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> and Burgundians, whose conquests in <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> preceded those of the Franks, showed less impatience to attain <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the principal benefits of civilised society.
 <NORP>Euric</NORP> was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> princes who expressed in writing the manners and customs of his people; and the composition of the <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> laws was a measure of policy rather than of justice, to alleviate the yoke and regain the affections of their <NORP>Gallic</NORP> subjects.
 (68) Thus, by a singular coincidence, the <NORP>Germans</NORP> framed their artless institutions at a time when the elaborate system of <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence was finally consummated.
 In the <NORP>Salic</NORP> laws, and the Pandects of Justinian, we may compare the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rudiments, and the full maturity, of civil wisdom; and whatever prejudices may be suggested in favour of barbarism, our calmer reflections will ascribe to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> the superior advantages, not only of science and reason, but of humanity and justice.
 Yet the laws of the barbarians were adapted to their wants and desires, their occupations and their capacity; and they all contributed to preserve the peace, and promote the improvements, of the society for whose use they were originally established.
 The Merovingians, instead of imposing a uniform rule of conduct on their various subjects, permitted each people, and each family, of their empire freely to enjoy their domestic institutions; (69) nor were the <NORP>Romans</NORP> excluded from the common benefits of this legal toleration.
 (70) The children embraced the law of their parents, the wife that of her husband, the freedman that of his patron; and in all causes where the parties were of different nations, the plaintiff or accuser was obliged to follow the tribunal of the defendant, who may always plead a judicial presumption of right or innocence.
 A more ample latitude was allowed, if every citizen, in the presence of the judge, might declare the law under which he desired to live, and the national society to which he chose to belong.
 Such an indulgence would abolish the partial distinctions of victory: and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provincials might patiently acquiesce in the hardships of their condition, since it depended on themselves to assume the privilege, if they dared to assert the character, of free and warlike barbarians.
 (71)Pecuniary fines for homicide.
 When justice inexorably requires the death of a murderer, each private citizen is fortified by the assurance that the laws, the magistrate, and he whole community, are the guardians of his personal safety.
 But in the loose society of the Germans, revenge was always honourable, and often meritorious: the independent warrior chastised, or vindicated, with his own hand, the injuries which he had offered or received; and he had only to dread the resentment of the sons and kinsmen of the enemy whom he had sacrificed to his selfish or angry passions.
 The magistrate, conscious of his weakness, interposed, not to punish, but to reconcile; and he was satisfied if he could persuade or compel the contending parties to pay and to accept the moderate fine which had been ascertained as the price of blood.
 (72) The fierce spirit of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> would have opposed a more rigorous sentence; the same fierceness despised these ineffectual restraints; and, when their simple manners had been corrupted by the wealth of Gaul, the public peace was continually violated by acts of hasty or deliberate guilt.
 In every just government the same penalty is inflicted, or at least is imposed, for the murder of a peasant or a prince.
 But the national inequality established by the <NORP>Franks</NORP> in their criminal proceedings was the last insult and abuse of conquest.
 (73) In the calm moments of legislation they solemnly pronounced that the life of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> was of smaller value than that of a barbarian.
 The Antrustion, (74) a name expressive of the most illustrious birth or dignity among the Franks, was appreciated at the sum of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred pieces of gold; while the noble provincial, who was admitted to the king's table, might be legally murdered at the expense of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred pieces.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> hundred were deemed sufficient for a <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> of ordinary condition; but the meaner <NORP>Romans</NORP> were exposed to disgrace and danger by a trifling compensation of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred, or even fifty, pieces of gold.
 Had these laws been regulated by any principle of equity or reason, the public protection should have supplied, in just proportion, the want of personal strength.
 But the legislator had weighed in the scale, not of justice, but of policy, the loss of a soldier against that of a slave: the head of an insolent and rapacious barbarian was guarded by a heavy fine; and the slightest aid was afforded to the most defenceless subjects.
 Time insensibly abated the pride of the conquerors, and the patience of the vanquished; and the boldest citizen was taught by experience that he might suffer more injuries than he could inflict.
 As the manners of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> became less ferocious, their laws were rendered more severe; and the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> kings attempted to imitate the impartial rigour of the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> and Burgundians.
 (75) Under the empire of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> murder was universally punished with death; and the use of capital punishments has been liberally multiplied in the jurisprudence of modern Europe.
 (76) Judgements of God.
 The civil and military professions, which had been separated by Constantine, were again united by the barbarians.
 The harsh sound of the <NORP>Teutonic</NORP> appellations was mollified into the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> titles of Duke, of Count, or of Praefect; and the same officer assumed, within his district, the command of the troops and the administration of justice.
 (77) But the fierce and illiterate chieftain was seldom qualified to discharge the duties of a judge, which require all of the faculties of a philosophic mind, laboriously cultivated by experience and study; and his rude ignorance was compelled to embrace some simple and visible methods of ascertaining the cause of justice.
 In every religion the Deity has been invoked to confirm the truth, or to punish the falsehood, of human testimony; but this powerful instrument was misapplied and abused by the simplicity of the <NORP>German</NORP> legislators.
 The party accused might justify his innocence, by producing before their tribunal a number of friendly witnesses, who solemnly declared their belief or assurance that he was not guilty.
 According to the weight of the charge this legal number of 'compurgators' was multiplied: <CARDINAL>seventy-two</CARDINAL> voices were required to absolve an incendiary or assassin; and when the chastity of a queen of <GPE>France</GPE> was suspected, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred gallant nobles swore, without hesitation, that the infant prince had been actually begotten by her deceased husband.
 (78) The sin and scandal of manifest and frequent perjuries engaged the magistrates to remove these dangerous temptations, and to supply the defects of human testimony by the famous experiments of fire and water.
 These extraordinary trials were so capriciously contrived, that in some cases guilt, and innocence in others, could not be proved without the interposition of a miracle.
 Such miracles were readily provided by fraud and credulity; the most intricate causes were determined by this easy and infallible method; and the turbulent barbarians, who might have disdained the sentence of the magistrate, submissively acquiesced in the judgment of God.
 (79) Judicial Combats.
 But the trials by single combat gradually obtained superior credit and authority among a warlike people, who could not believe that a brave man deserved to suffer, or that a coward deserved to live.
 (80) Both in civil and criminal proceedings, the plaintiff, or accuser, the defendant, or even the witness, were exposed to mortal challenge from the antagonist who was destitute of legal proofs; and it was incumbent on them either to desert their cause or publicly to maintain their honour in the lists of battle.
 They fought either on foot or on horseback, according to the custom of their nation; (81) and the decision of the sword or lance was ratified by the sanction of Heaven, of the judge, and of the people.
 This sanguinary law was introduced in to <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> by the Burgundians; and their legislator <PERSON>Gundobald</PERSON> (82) condescended to answer the complaints and objections of his subject Avitus.
 By such prevailing arguments, the absurd and cruel practice of judicial duels, which had been peculiar to some tribes of Germany, was propagated and established in all the monarchies of Europe, from <GPE>Sicily</GPE> to the Baltic.
 At the end of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> centuries the reign of legal violence was not totally extinguished; and the ineffectual censures of saints, of popes, and of synods, may seem to prove that the influence of superstition is weakened by its unnatural alliance with reason and humanity The tribunals were stained with the blood, perhaps, of innocent and respectable citizens; the law, which now favours the rich, then yielded to the strong; and the old, the feeble, and the infirm, were condemned either to renounce their fairest claims and possessions, to sustain the dangers of an unequal conflict, (83) or to trust the doubtful aid of a mercenary champion.
 This oppressive jurisprudence was imposed on the provincials of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> who complained of any injuries in their persons and property.
 Whatever might be the strength or courage of individuals, the victorious barbarians excelled in the love and exercise of arms; and the vanquished <NORP>Roman</NORP> was unjustly summoned to repeat, in his own person, the bloody contest which had been already decided against his country.
 (84) Division of the lands by the Barbarians.
 A devouring host of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and twenty thousand <NORP>Germans</NORP> had formerly passed the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> under the command of Ariovistus.
 One-third part of the fertile lands of the <GPE>Sequani</GPE> was appropriated to their use; and the conqueror soon repeated his oppressive demand of another third, for the accommodation of a new colony of twenty-four thousand barbarians whom he had invited to share the rich harvest of <GPE>Gaul.
</GPE> (85) At the distance of five hundred years the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> and Burgundians, who revenged the defeat of Ariovistus, usurped the same unequal proportion of <CARDINAL>two-thirds</CARDINAL> of the subject lands.
 But this distribution, instead of spreading over the province, may be reasonably confined to the peculiar districts where the victorious people had been planted by their own choice or by the policy of their leader.
 In these districts each barbarian was connected by the ties of hospitality with some <NORP>Roman</NORP> provincial.
 To this unwelcome guest the proprietor was compelled to abandon <CARDINAL>two-thirds</CARDINAL> of his patrimony: but the German, a shepherd and a hunter, might sometimes content himself with a spacious range of wood and pasture, and resign the smallest, though most valuable, portion to the toil of the industrious husbandman.
 (86) The silence of ancient and authentic testimony has encouraged an opinion that the rapine of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> was not moderated or disguised by the forms of a legal division; that they dispersed themselves over the provinces of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> without order or control; and that each victorious robber, according to his wants, his avarice, and his strength, measured with his sword the extent of his new inheritance.
 At a distance from their sovereign the barbarians might indeed be tempted to exercise such arbitrary depredation; but the firm and artful policy of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> must curb a licentious spirit which would aggravate the misery of the vanquished whilst it corrupted the union and discipline of the conquerors.
 The memorable vase of <PRODUCT>Soissons</PRODUCT> is a monument and a pledge of the regular distribution of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> spoils.
 It was the duty and the interest of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> to provide rewards for a successful army, and settlements for a numerous people, without inflicting any wanton or superfluous injuries on the loyal catholics of <GPE>Gaul.
</GPE> The ample fund which he might lawfully acquire of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> patrimony, vacant lands, and <NORP>Gothic</NORP> usurpations, would diminish the cruel necessity of seizure and confiscation, and the humble provincials would more patiently acquiesce in the equal and regular distribution of their loss.
 (87) Domain and benefices of the Merovingians.
 The wealth of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> princes consisted in their extensive domain.
 After the conquest of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> they still delighted in the rustic simplicity of their ancestors; the cities were abandoned to solitude and decay; and their coins, their charters, and their synods, are still inscribed with the names of the villas or rural palaces in which they successively resided.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> of these palaces, a title which need not excite any unseasonable ideas of art or luxury, were scattered through the provinces of their kingdom; and if some might claim the honours of a fortress, the far greater part could be esteemed only in the light of profitable farms.
 The mansion of the long-haired kings was surrounded with convenient yards and stables for the cattle and the poultry; the garden was planted with useful vegetables; the various trades, the labours of agriculture, and even the arts of hunting and fishing, were exercised by servile hands for the emolument of the sovereign; his magazines were filled with corn and wine, either for sale or consumption; and the whole administration was conducted by the strictest maxims of private economy.
 (88) This ample patrimony was appropriated to supply the hospitable plenty of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> and his successors, and to reward the fidelity of their brave companions, who, both in peace and war, were devoted to their personal service.
 Instead of a horse or a suit of armour, each companion, according to his rank, or merit, or favour, was invested with a benefice, the primitive name and most simple form of the feudal possessions .
 These gifts might be resumed at the pleasure of the sovereign; and his feeble prerogative derived some support from the influence of his liberality.
 But this dependent tenure was gradually abolished (89) by the independent and rapacious nobles of France, who established the perpetual property and hereditary succession of their benefices; a revolution salutary to the earth, which had been injured or neglected by its precarious masters.
 (90) Besides these royal and beneficiary estates, a large proportion had been assigned, in the division of Gaul, of allodial and <NORP>Salic</NORP> lands: they were exempt from tribute, and the <NORP>Salic</NORP> lands were equally shared among the male descendants of the Franks.
 (91) Private usurpations .
 In the bloody discord and silent decay of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> line a new order of tyrants arose in the provinces, who, under the appellation of Seniors or Lords, usurped a right to govern and a licence to oppress the subjects of their peculiar territory.
 Their ambition might be checked by the hostile resistance of an equal: but the laws were extinguished; and the sacrilegious barbarians, who dared to provoke the vengeance of a saint or bishop, (92) would seldom respect the landmarks of a profane and defenceless neighbour.
 The common or public rights of nature, such as they had always been deemed by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence, (93) were severely restrained by the <NORP>German</NORP> conquerors, whose amusement, or rather passion, was the exercise of hunting.
 The vague dominion which MAN has assumed over the wild inhabitants of the earth, the air, and the waters, was confined to some fortunate individuals of the human species.
 <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was again overspread with woods; and the animals, who were reserved for the use or pleasure of the lord, might ravage with impunity the fields of his industrious vassals.
 The chase was the sacred privilege of the nobles and their domestic servants.
 Plebeian transgressors were legally chastised with stripes and imprisonment; (94) but in an age which admitted a slight composition for the life of a citizen, it was a capital crime to destroy a stag or a wild bull within the precincts of the royal forests.
 (95) Personal servitude.
 According to the maxims of ancient war, the conqueror became the lawful master of the enemy whom he had subdued and spared: (96) and the fruitful cause of personal slavery, which had been almost suppressed by the peaceful sovereignty of Rome, was again revived and multiplied by the perpetual hostilities of the independent barbarians.
 The Goth, the Burgundian, or the Frank, who returned from a successful expedition, dragged after him a long train of sheep, of oxen, and of human captives, whom he treated with the same brutal contempt.
 The youths of an elegant form and ingenuous aspect were set apart for the domestic service; a doubtful situation, which alternately exposed them to the favourable or cruel impulse of passion.
 The useful mechanics and servants (smiths, carpenters, tailors, shoemakers, cooks, gardeners, dyers, and workmen in gold and silver, etc.
) employed their skill for the use or profit of the master.
 But the <NORP>Roman</NORP> captives who were destitute of art, but capable of labour, were condemned, without regard to their former rank, to tend the cattle and cultivate the lands of the barbarians.
 The number of the hereditary bondsmen who were attached to the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> estates was continually increased by new supplies; and the servile people, according to the situation and temper of their lords, was sometimes raised by precarious indulgence, and more frequently depressed by capricious despotism.
 (97) An absolute power of life and death was exercised by these lords; and when they married their daughters, a train of useful servants, chained on the waggons to prevent their escape, was sent as a nuptial present into a distant country.
 (98) The majesty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> laws protected the liberty of each citizen against the rash effects of his own distress or despair.
 But the subjects of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> kings might alienate their personal freedom; and this act of legal suicide, which was familiarly practised, is expressed in terms most disgraceful and afflicting to the dignity of human nature.
 (99) The example of the poor, who purchased life by the sacrifice of all that can render life desirable, was gradually imitated by the feeble and the devout, who, in times of public disorder, pusillanimously crowded to shelter themselves under the battlements of a powerful chief and around the shrine of a popular saint.
 Their submission was accepted by these temporal or spiritual patrons; and the hasty transaction irrecoverably fixed their own condition and that of their latest posterity.
 From the reign of Clovis, during five successive centuries, the laws and manners of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> uniformly tended to promote the increase, and to confirm the duration, of personal servitude.
 Time and violence almost obliterated the intermediate ranks of society, and left an obscure and narrow interval between the noble and the slave.
 This arbitrary and recent division has been transformed by pride and prejudice into a national distinction, universally established by the arms and the laws of the Merovingians.
 The nobles, who claimed their genuine or fabulous descent from the independent and victorious Franks, have asserted and abused the indefeasible right of conquest over a prostrate crowd of slaves and plebeians, to whom they imputed the imaginary disgrace of a <NORP>Gallic</NORP> or <NORP>Roman</NORP> extraction.
 Example of Auvergne.
 The general state and revolutions of France, a name which was imposed by the conquerors, may be illustrated by the particular example of a province, a diocese, or a senatorial family.
 <GPE>Auvergne</GPE> had formerly maintained a just pre-eminence among the independent states and cities of <GPE>Gaul.
</GPE> The brave and numerous inhabitants displayed a singular trophy—the sword of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> himself, which he had lost when he was repulsed before the walls of Gergovia.
 (100) As the common offspring of Troy, they claimed a fraternal alliance with the Romans; (101) and if each province had imitated the courage and loyalty of Auvergne, the fall of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire might have been prevented or delayed.
 They firmly maintained the fidelity which they had reluctantly sworn to the Visigoths; but when their bravest nobles had fallen in the battle of Poitiers, they accepted without resistance a victorious and catholic sovereign.
 This easy and valuable conquest was achieved and possessed by Theodoric, the eldest son of Clovis: but the remote province was separated from his <NORP>Austrasian</NORP> dominions by the intermediate kingdoms of Soisson, Paris, and Orleans, which formed, after their father's death, the inheritance of his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> brothers.
 The king of Paris, Childebert, was tempted by the neighbourhood and beauty of Auvergne.
 (102) The upper country, which rises towards the south into the mountains of the Cevennes, presented a rich and various prospect of woods and pastures; the sides of the hills were clothed with vines; and each eminence was crowned with a villa or castle.
 In the Lower Auvergne, the river <GPE>Allier</GPE> flows through the fair and spacious plain of Limagne; and the inexhaustible fertility of the soil supplied, and still supplies, without any interval of repose, the constant repetition of the same harvests.
 (103) On the false report that their lawful sovereign had been slain in Germany, the city and diocese of <GPE>Auvergne</GPE> were betrayed by the grandson of <PERSON>Sidonius</PERSON> Apollinaris.
 <PERSON>Childebert</PERSON> enjoyed this clandestine victory; and the free subjects of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> threatened to desert his standard if he indulged his private resentment while the nation was engaged in the <NORP>Burgundian</NORP> war.
 But the <NORP>Franks</NORP> of Austrasia soon yielded to the persuasive eloquence of their king.
 By the execution of this promise <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> justly forfeited the allegiance of a people whom he devoted to destruction.
 His troops, reinforced by the fiercest barbarians of Germany, (104) spread desolation over the fruitful face of Auvergne; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> places only, a strong castle and a holy shrine, were saved or redeemed from their licentious fury.
 The castle of <GPE>Meroliac</GPE> (105) was seated on a lofty rock, which rose an hundred feet above the surface of the plain; and a large reservoir of fresh water was enclosed with some arable lands within the circle of its fortifications.
 The <NORP>Franks</NORP> beheld with envy and despair this impregnable fortress: but they surprised a party of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> stragglers; and, as they were oppressed by the number of their captives, they fixed at a trifling ransom the alternative of life or death for these wretched victims, whom the cruel barbarians were prepared to massacre on the refusal of the garrison.
 Another detachment penetrated as far as Brivas, or Brioude, where the inhabitants, with their valuable effects, had taken refuge in the sanctuary of St.
 Julian.
 The doors of the church resisted the assault, but a daring soldier entered through a window of the choir and opened a passage to his companions.
 The clergy and people, the sacred and the profane spoils, were rudely torn from the altar; and the sacrilegious division was made at a small distance from the town of Brioude.
 But this act of impiety was severely chastised by the devout son of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> He punished with death the most atrocious offenders; left their secret accomplices to the vengeance of St.
 Julian; released the captives; restored the plunder; and extended the rights of sanctuary five miles round the sepulchre of the holy martyr.
 (106) Story of Attalus.
 Before the <NORP>Austrasian</NORP> army retreated from Auvergne, <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> exacted some pledges of the future loyalty of a people whose just hatred could be restrained only by their fear.
 A select band of noble youths, the sons of the principal senators, was delivered to the conqueror as the hostages of the faith of <PERSON>Childebert</PERSON> and of their countrymen.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rumour of war or conspiracy these guiltless youths were reduced to a state of servitude; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of them, Attalus, (107) whose adventures are more particularly related, kept his master's horses in the diocese of Treves.
 After a painful search he was discovered in this unworthy occupation, by the emissaries of his grandfather, <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> bishop of Langres; but his offers of ransom were sternly rejected by the avarice of the barbarian, who required an exorbitant sum of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> pounds of gold for the freedom of his noble captive.
 His deliverance was effected by the hardy stratagem of Leo, a slave belonging to the kitchens of the bishop of Langres.
 (108) An unknown agent easily introduced him into the same family.
 The barbarian purchased <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> for the price of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> pieces of gold; and was pleased to learn that he was deeply skilled in the luxury of an episcopal table: <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> assured him that, if he would provide a sufficient quantity of poultry, his wishes should be satisfied.
 The master, who already aspired to the merit of elegant hospitality, assumed as his own the praise which the voracious guests unanimously bestowed on his cook; and the dexterous <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> insensibly acquired the trust and management of his household.
 After the patient expectation of a whole year, he cautiously whispered his design to Attalus, and exhorted him to prepare for flight in the ensuing night.
 At the hour of midnight the intemperate guests retired from table, and the Frank's son-in-law, whom <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> attended to his apartment with a nocturnal potation, condescended to jest on the facility with which he might betray his trust.
 The intrepid slave, after sustaining this dangerous raillery, entered his master's bedchamber; removed his spear and shield; silently drew the fleetest horses from the stable; unbarred the ponderous gates; and excited <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> to save his life and liberty by incessant diligence.
 Their apprehensions urged them to leave their horses on the banks of the Meuse; (109) they swam the river, wandered <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days in the adjacent forest, and subsisted only by the accidental discovery of a wild plum-tree.
 As they lay concealed in a dark thicket, they heard the noise of horses; they were terrified by the angry countenance of their master, and they anxiously listened to his declaration that, if he could seize the guilty fugitives, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of them he would cut in pieces with his sword, and would expose the other on a gibbet.
 At length <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> and his faithful <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> reached the friendly habitation of a presbyter of Rheims, who recruited their fainting strength with bread and wine, concealed them from the search of their enemy, and safely conducted them beyond the limits of the <NORP>Austrasian</NORP> kingdom to the episcopal palace of Langres.
 <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> embraced his grandson with tears of joy, gratefully delivered <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> with his whole family from the yoke of servitude, and bestowed on him the property of a farm, where he might end his days in happiness and freedom.
 Perhaps this singular adventure, which is marked with so many circumstances of truth and nature, was related by <PERSON>Attalus</PERSON> himself to his cousin or nephew, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> historian of the Franks.
 <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> of Tours (110) was born about <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> years after the death of <PERSON>Sidonius</PERSON> Apollinaris; and their situation was almost similar, since each of them was a native of Auvergne, a senator, and a bishop.
 The difference of their style and sentiments may, therefore, express the decay of Gaul; and clearly ascertain how much, in so short a space, the human mind had lost of its energy and refinement.
 (111) Privileges of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> of <GPE>Gaul.
</GPE> We are now qualified to despise the opposite, and perhaps artful, misrepresentations which have softened or exaggerated the oppression of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the reign of the Merovingians.
 The conquerors never promulgated any universal edict of servitude or confiscation: but a degenerate people, who excused their weakness by the specious names of politeness and peace, was exposed to the arms and laws of the ferocious barbarians, who contemptuously insulted their possessions, their freedom, and their safety.
 Their personal injuries were partial and irregular; but the great body of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> survived the revolution, and still preserved the property and privileges of citizens.
 A large portion of their lands was exacted for the use of the Franks: but they enjoyed the remainder exempt from tribute; (112) and the same irresistible violence which swept away the arts and manufactures of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> destroyed the elaborate and expensive system of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> despotism.
 The provincials must frequently deplore the savage jurisprudence of the <NORP>Salic</NORP> or <NORP>Ripuarian</NORP> laws but their private life, in the important concerns of marriage, testaments, or inheritance, was still regulated by the Theodosian Code; and a discontented <NORP>Roman</NORP> might freely aspire or descend to the title and character of a barbarian.
 The honours of the state were accessible to his ambition: the education and temper of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> more peculiarly qualified them for the offices of civil government; and as soon as emmulation had rekindled their military ardour, they were permitted to march in the ranks, or even at the head, of the victorious Germans.
 I shall not attempt to enumerate the generals and magistrates whose names (113) attest the liberal policy of the Merovingians.
 The supreme command of Burgundy, with the title of <PERSON>Patrician</PERSON> was successively intrusted to <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> Romans; and the last and most powerful, Mummolus, (114) who alternately saved and disturbed the monarchy, had supplanted his father in the station of count of Autun, and left a treasure of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> talents of gold and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> talents of silver.
 The fierce and illiterate barbarians were excluded, during several generations, from the dignities, and even from the orders, of the church.
 (115) The clergy of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> consisted almost entirely of native provincials; the haughty <NORP>Franks</NORP> fell prostrate at the feet of their subjects who were dignified with the episcopal character; and the power and riches which had been lost in war were insensibly recovered by superstition.
 (116) In all temporal affairs the Theodosian Code was the universal law of the clergy; but the barbaric jurisprudence had liberally provided for their personal safety: a subdeacon was equivalent to <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Franks; the antrustion and priest were held in similar estimation; and the life of a bishop was appreciated far above the common standard, at the price of nine hundred pieces of gold.
 (117) The <NORP>Romans</NORP> communicated to their conquerors the use of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion and <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> language; (118) but their language and their religion had alike degenerated from the simple purity of the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> and <NORP>Apostolic</NORP> age.
 The progress of superstition and barbarism was rapid and universal: the worship of the saints concealed from vulgar eyes the God of the Christians, and the rustic dialect of peasants and soldiers was corrupted by a <NORP>Teutonic</NORP> idiom and pronunciation.
 Yet such intercourse of sacred and social communion eradicated the distinctions of birth and victory; and the nations of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> were gradually confounded under the name and government of the Franks.
 Anarchy of the Franks.
 The Franks, after they mingled with their <NORP>Gallic</NORP> subjects, might have imparted the most valuable of human gifts, a spirit and system of constitutional liberty.
 Under a king, hereditary but limited, the chiefs and counsellors might have debated at <GPE>Paris</GPE> in the palace of the Caesars: the adjacent field, where the emperors reviewed their mercenary legions, would have admitted the legislative assembly of freemen and warriors; and the rude model which had been sketched in the woods of <GPE>Germany</GPE> (119) might have been polished and improved by the civil wisdom of the Romans.
 But the careless barbarians, secure of their personal independence, disdained the labour of government: the <DATE>annual</DATE> assemblies of the month of March were silently abolished, and the nation was separated and almost dissolved by the conquest of <GPE>Gaul.
</GPE> (120) The monarchy was left without any regular establishment of justice, of arms, or of revenue.
 The successors of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> wanted resolution to assume, or strength to exercise, the legislative and executive powers which the people had abdicated: the royal prerogative was distinguished only by a more ample privilege of rapine and murder; and the love of freedom, so often invigorated and disgraced by private ambition, was reduced among the licentious <NORP>Franks</NORP> to the contempt of order and the desire of impunity.
 Seventy-five years after the death of Clovis, his grandson Gontran, king of Burgundy, sent an army to invade the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> possessions of Septimania, or Languedoc.
 The troops of Burgundy, Berry, Auvergne, and the adjacent territories were excited by the hopes of spoil.
 They marched without discipline under the banners of <NORP>German</NORP> or <NORP>Gallic</NORP> counts: their attack was feeble and unsuccessful, but the friendly and hostile provinces were desolated with indiscriminate rage.
 The cornfields, the villages, the churches themselves, were consumed by fire; the inhabitants were massacred or dragged into captivity; and, in the disorderly retreat, five thousand of these inhuman savages were destroyed by hunger or intestine discord.
 When the pious <PERSON>Gontran</PERSON> reproached the guilt or neglect of their leaders, and threatened to inflict, not a legal sentence, but instant and arbitrary execution, they accused the universal and incurable corruption of the people.
 It has been reserved for the same nation to expose, by their intemperate vices, the most odious abuse of freedom, and to supply its loss by the spirit of honour and humanity which now alleviates and dignifies their obedience to an absolute sovereign.
 The <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> of Spain.
 The <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> had resigned to <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> the greatest part of their <NORP>Gallic</NORP> possessions; but their loss was amply compensated by the easy conquest and secure enjoyment of the provinces of Spain.
 From the monarchy of the Goths, which soon involved the <NORP>Suevic</NORP> kingdom of Gallicia, the modern <NORP>Spaniards</NORP> still derive some national vanity, but the historian of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire is neither invited nor compelled to pursue the obscure and barren series of their annals.
 (122) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> of <GPE>Spain</GPE> were separated from the rest of mankind by the lofty ridge of the Pyrenaean mountains: their manners and institutions, as far as they were common to the <NORP>Germanic</NORP> tribes, have been already explained.
 I have anticipated in the preceding chapter the most important of their ecclesiastical events — the fall of <NORP>Arianism</NORP> and the persecution of the Jews: and it only remains to observe some interesting circumstances which relate to the civil and ecclesiastical constitution of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> kingdom.
 Legislative Assemblies of Spain.
 After their conversion from idolatry or heresy, the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> were disposed to embrace, with equal submission, the inherent evils and the accidental benefits of superstition.
 But the prelates of France, long before the extinction of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> race, had degenerated into fighting and hunting barbarians.
 They disdained the use of synods, forgot the laws of temperance and chastity, and preferred the indulgence of private ambition and luxury to the general interest of the sacerdotal profession.
 (123) The bishops of <GPE>Spain</GPE> respected themselves, and were respected by the public: their indissoluble union disguised their vices, and confirmed their authority; and the regular discipline of the church introduced peace, order, and stability into the government of the state.
 From the reign of Recared, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> catholic king, to that of Witiza, the immediate predecessor of the unfortunate Roderic, <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> national councils were successively convened.
 The <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> metropolitans, Toledo, Seville, Merida, Braga, Tarragona, and Narbonne, presided according to their respective seniority; the assembly was composed of their suffragan bishops, who appeared in person or by their proxies, and a place was assigned to the most holy or opulent of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> abbots.
 During the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days of the convocation, as long as they agitated the ecclesiastical questions of doctrine and discipline, the profane laity was excluded from their debates, which were conducted, however, with decent solemnity.
 But on the morning of the fourth day the doors were thrown open for the entrance of the great officers of the palace, the dukes and counts of the provinces, the judges of the cities, and the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nobles; and the decrees of Heaven were ratified by the consent of the people.
 The same rules .
were observed in the provincial assemblies, the <DATE>annual</DATE> synods, which were empowered to hear complaints and to redress grievances; and a legal government was supported by the prevailing influence of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> clergy.
 The bishops, who in each revolution were prepared to flatter the victorious and to insult the prostrate, laboured with diligence and success to kindle the flames of persecution, and to exalt the mitre above the crown.
 Yet the national councils of Toledo, in which the free spirit of the barbarians was tempered and guided by episcopal policy, have established some prudent laws for the common benefit of the king and people.
 The vacancy of the throne was supplied by the choice of the bishops and palatines; and after the failure of the line of Alaric, the regal dignity was still limited to the pure and noble blood of the Goths.
 The clergy, who anointed their lawful prince, always recommended, and sometimes practised, the duty of allegiance: and the spiritual censures were denounced on the heads of the impious subjects who should resist his authority, conspire against his life, or violate by an indecent union the chastity even of his widow.
 But the monarch himself, when he ascended the throne, was bound by a reciprocal oath to God and his people that he would faithfully execute his important trust.
 The real or imaginary faults of his administration were subject to the control of a powerful aristocracy; and the bishops and palatines were guarded by a fundamental privilege that they should not be degraded, imprisoned, tortured, nor punished with death, exile, or confiscation, unless by the free and public judgment of their peers.
 (124) Code of the Visigoths.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of these legislative councils of <GPE>Toledo</GPE> examined and ratified the code of laws which had been compiled by a succession of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kings, from the fierce <NORP>Euric</NORP> to the devout Egica.
 As long as the <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> themselves were satisfied with the rude customs of their ancestors, they indulged their subjects of <PERSON>Aquitain</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> in the enjoyment of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> law.
 Their gradual improvement in arts, in policy, and at length in religion, encouraged them to imitate and to supersede these foreign institutions, and to compose a code of civil and criminal jurisprudence for the use of a great and united people.
 The same obligations and the same privileges were communicated to the nations of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> monarchy; and the conquerors, insensibly renouncing the <NORP>Teutonic</NORP> idiom, submitted to the restraints of equity, and exalted the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to the participation of freedom.
 The merit of this impartial policy was enhanced by the situation of <GPE>Spain</GPE> under the reign of the Visigoths.
 The provincials were long separated from their <NORP>Arian</NORP> masters by the irreconcilable difference of religion.
 After the conversion of <PERSON>Recared</PERSON> had removed the prejudices of the catholics, the coasts both of the <LOC>Ocean</LOC> and <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> were still possessed by the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> emperors, who secretly excited a discontented people to reject the yoke of the barbarians, and to assert the name and dignity of <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens.
 The allegiance of doubtful subjects is indeed most effectually secured by their own persuasion that they hazard more in a revolt than they can hope to obtain by a revolution; but it has appeared so natural to oppress those whom we hate and fear, that the contrary system well deserves the praise of wisdom and moderation.
 (125) Revolution of Britain.
 While the kingdoms of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> were established in <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Spain, the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> achieved the conquest of Britain, the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> great diocese of the praefecture of the West.
 Since <GPE>Britain</GPE> was already separated from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, I might without reproach decline a story familiar to the most illiterate, and obscure to the most learned, of my readers.
 The Saxons, who excelled in the use of the oar or the battleaxe, were ignorant of the art which could alone perpetuate the fame of their exploits; the provincials, relapsing into barbarism, neglected to describe the ruin of their country; and the doubtful tradition was almost extinguished before the missionaries of <GPE>Rome</GPE> restored the light of science and Christianity.
 The declamations of Gildas, the fragments or fables of Nennius, the obscure hints of the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> laws and chronicles, and the ecclesiastical tales of the venerable Bede, (126) have been illustrated by the diligence, and sometimes embellished by the fancy, of succeeding writers, whose works I am not ambitious either to censure or to transcribe.
 (127) Yet the historian of the empire may be tempted to pursue the revolutions of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> province till it vanishes from his sight; and an <NORP>Englishman</NORP> may curiously trace the establishment of the barbarians from whom he derives his name, his laws, and perhaps his origin.
 Descent of the Saxons, A.
D.
 449.
 About <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> years after the dissolution of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government <PERSON>Vortigern</PERSON> appears to have obtained the supreme, though precarious, command of the princes and cities of Britain.
 That unfortunate monarch has been almost unanimously condemned for the weak and mischievous policy of inviting (128) a formidable stranger to repel the vexatious inroads of a domestic foe.
 His ambassadors are despatched by the gravest historians to the coast of Germany: they address a pathetic oration to the general assembly of the Saxons, and those warlike barbarians resolve to assist with a fleet and army the suppliants of a distant and unknown island.
 If <GPE>Britain</GPE> had indeed been unknown to the Saxons, the measure of its calamities would have been less complete.
 But the strength of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government could not always guard the maritime province against the pirates of Germany: the independent and divided states were exposed to their attacks, and the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> might sometimes join the <NORP>Scots</NORP> and the <NORP>Picts</NORP> in a tacit or express confederacy of rapine and destruction.
 <PERSON>Vortigern</PERSON> could only balance the various perils which assaulted on every side his throne and his people; and his policy may deserve either praise or excuse if he preferred the alliance of those barbarians whose naval power rendered them the most dangerous enemies, and the most servicable allies.
 <PERSON>Hengist</PERSON> and Horsa, as they ranged along the eastern coast with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ships, were engaged by the promise of an ample stipend to embrace the defence of Britain, and their intrepid valour soon delivered the country from the <NORP>Caledonian</NORP> invaders.
 The Isle of Thanet, a secure and fertile district, was alloted for the residence of these <NORP>German</NORP> auxiliaries, and they were supplied according to the treaty with a plentiful allowance of clothing and provisions.
 This favourable reception encouraged five thousand warriors to embark with their families in <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> vessels, and the infant power of <PERSON>Hengist</PERSON> was fortified by this strong and seasonable reinforcement.
 The crafty barbarian suggested to <PERSON>Vortigern</PERSON> the obvious advantage of fixing, in the neighbourhood of the Picts, a colony of faithful allies: a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> fleet, of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> ships, under he command of his son and nephew, sailed from Germany, ravaged the Orkneys, and disembarked a new army on the coast of <GPE>Northumberland</GPE> or Lothian, at the opposite extremity of the devoted land.
 It was easy to foresee, but it vas impossible to prevent, the impending evils.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations were soon divided and exasperated by mutual jealousies.
 The <NORP>Saxons</NORP> magnified all that they had done and suffered in the cause of an ungrateful people; while the <NORP>Britons</NORP> regretted the liberal rewards which could not satisfy the avarice of those haughty mercenaries.
 The causes of fear and hatred were inflamed into an irreconcilable quarrel.
 The <NORP>Saxons</NORP> flew to arms; and if they perpetrated a treacherous massacre during the security of a feast, they destroyed the reciprocal confidence which sustains the intercourse of peace and war.
 (129) Establishment of the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> heptarchy, A.
D.
 455-582.
 Hengist, who boldly aspired to the conquest of Britain, exhorted his countrymen to embrace the glorious opportunity: he painted in lively colours the fertility of the soil, the wealth of the cities, the pusillanimous temper of the natives, and the convenient situation of a spacious solitary island, accessible on all sides to the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> fleets.
 The successive colonies which issued in the period of a century from the mouths of the Elbe, the Weser, and the Rhine, were principally composed of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> valiant tribes or nations of Germany; the Jutes, the old Saxons, and the Angles.
 The Jutes, who fought under the peculiar banner of Hengist, assumed the merit of leading their countrymen in the paths of glory, and of erecting in <GPE>Kent</GPE> the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> independent kingdom.
 The fame of the enterprise was attributed to the primitive Saxons, and the common laws and language of the conquerors are described by the national appellation of a people which, at the end of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred years, produced the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> monarchs of <LOC>South</LOC> Britain.
 The <PERSON>Angles</PERSON> were distinguished by their numbers and their success; and they claimed the honour of fixing a perpetual name on the country of which they occupied the most ample portion.
 The barbarians, who followed the hopes of rapine either on the land or sea, were insensibly blended with this triple confederacy; the Frisians, who had been tempted by their vicinity to the <NORP>British</NORP> shores, might balance during a short space the strength and reputation of the native Saxons; the Danes, the Prussians, the Rugians, are faintly described; and some adventurous Huns, who had wandered as far as the Baltic, might embark on board the <NORP>German</NORP> vessels for the conquest of a new world.
 (130) But this arduous achievement was not prepared or executed by the union of national powers.
 Each intrepid chieftain, according to the measure of his fame and fortunes, assembled his followers; equipped a fleet of three, or perhaps of sixty, vessels; chose the place of the attack, and conducted his subsequent operations according to the events of the war and the dictates of his private interest.
 In the invasion of <GPE>Britain</GPE> many heroes vanquished and fell; but only <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> victorious leaders assumed, or at least maintained, the title of Kings.
 <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> independent thrones, the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> Heptarchy, were founded by the conquerors; and <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> families, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of which has been continued, by female succession, to our present sovereign, derived their equal and sacred lineage from Woden, the god of war.
 It has been pretended that this republic of kings was moderated by a general council and a supreme magistrate.
 But such an artificial scheme of policy is repugnant to the rude and turbulent spirit of the Saxons: their laws are silent, and their imperfect annals afford only a dark and bloody prospect of intestine discord.
 (131) State of the Britons.
 A monk, who in the profound ignorance of human life has presumed to exercise the office of historian, strangely disfigures the state of <GPE>Britain</GPE> at the time of its separation from the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 <PERSON>Gildas</PERSON> (132) describes in florid language the improvements of agriculture, the foreign trade which flowed with every tide into the <LOC>Thames</LOC> and the Severn, the solid and lofty construction of public and private edifices: he accuses the sinful luxury of the <NORP>British</NORP> people; of a people, according to the same writer, ignorant of the most simple arts, and incapable, without the aid of the Romans, of providing walls of stone or weapons of iron for the defence of their native land.
 (133) Under the long dominion of the emperors, <GPE>Britain</GPE> had been insensibly moulded into the elegant and servile form of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> province, whose safety was intrusted to a foreign power.
 The subjects of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> contemplated their new freedom with surprise and terror, they were left destitute of any civil or military constitution; and their uncertain rulers wanted either skill, or courage, or authority to direct the public force against the common enemy.
 The introduction of the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> betrayed their internal weakness, and degraded the character both of the prince and people.
 Their consternation magnified the danger, the want of union diminished their resources, and the madness of civil factions was more solicitous to accuse than to remedy the evils which they imputed to the misconduct of their adversaries.
 Yet the <NORP>Britons</NORP> were not ignorant, they could not be ignorant, of the manufacture or the use of arms: the successive and disorderly attacks of the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> allowed them to recover from their amazement, and the prosperous or adverse events of the war added discipline and experience to their native valour.
 Their resistance,.
 While the continent of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> yielded, without resistance, to the barbarians, the <NORP>British</NORP> island, alone and unaided, maintained a long, vigorous, though an unsuccessful, struggle, against the formidable pirates who, almost at the same instant, assaulted the northern, the eastern, and the southern coasts.
 The cities, which had been fortified with skill, were defended with resolution; the advantages of ground, hills, forests, and morasses, were diligently improved by the inhabitants; the conquest of each district was purchased with blood and the defeats of the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> are strongly attested by the discreet silence of their annalist.
 <PERSON>Hengist</PERSON> might hope to achieve the conquest of Britain; but his ambition, in an active reign of thirty-five years, was confined to the possession of Kent; and the numerous colony which he had planted in the <LOC>North</LOC> was extirpated by the sword of the Britons.
 The monarchy of the <LOC>West</LOC> <NORP>Saxons</NORP> was laboriously founded by the persevering efforts of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> martial generations.
 The life of Cerdic, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the bravest of the children of Woden, was consumed in the conquest of <GPE>Hampshire</GPE> and the Isle of Wight, and the loss which he sustained in the battle of Mount Badon reduced him to a state of inglorious repose.
 Kenric, his valiant son, advanced into Wiltshire; besieged Salisbury, at that time seated on a commanding eminence; and vanquished an army which advanced to the relief of the city.
 In the subsequent battle of Marlborough, (134) his <NORP>British</NORP> enemies displayed their military science.
 Their troops were formed in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> lines; each line consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> distinct bodies; and the cavalry, the archers, and the pikemen were distributed according to the principles of <NORP>Roman</NORP> tactics.
 The <NORP>Saxons</NORP> charged in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> weighty column, boldly encountered with their short swords the long lances of the Britons, and maintained an equal conflict till the approach of night.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> decisive victories, the death of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <NORP>British</NORP> kings, and the reduction of Cirencester, Bath, and Gloucester, established the fame and power of Ceaulin, the grandson of Cerdic, who carried his victorious arms to the banks of the Severn.
 and flight.
 After a war of an hundred years the independent <NORP>Britons</NORP> still occupied the whole extent of the western coast, from the wall of <GPE>Antoninus</GPE> to the extreme promontory of Cornwall; and the principal cities of the inland country still opposed the arms of the barbarians.
 Resistance became more languid, as the number and boldness of the assailants continually increased.
 Winning their way by slow and painful efforts, the Saxons, the Angles, and their various confederates, advanced from the North, from the East, and from the South, till their victorious banners were united in the centre of the island.
 Beyond the <LOC>Severn</LOC> the <NORP>Britons</NORP> still asserted their national freedom, which survived the heptarchy, and even the monarchy of the Saxons.
 The bravest warriors, who preferred exile to slavery, found a secure refuge in the mountains of Wales: the reluctant submission of <GPE>Cornwall</GPE> was delayed for some ages; (135) and a band of fugitives acquired a settlement in Gaul, by their own valour, or the liberality of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> kings.
 (136) The western angle of <GPE>Armorica</GPE> acquired the new appellations of <GPE>Cornwall</GPE> and the 'Lesser Britain; and the vacant lands of the <LOC>Osismii</LOC> were filled by a strange people, who, under the authority of their counts and bishops, preserved the laws and language of their ancestors.
 To the feeble descendants of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> and Charlemagne, the <NORP>Britons</NORP> of <GPE>Armorica</GPE> refused the customary tribute, subdued the neighbouring dioceses of Vannes, Rennes, and Nantes, and formed a powerful, though vassal, state, which has been united to the crown of France.
 (137) The fame of Arthur.
 In a century of perpetual, or at least implacable, war, much courage, and some skill, must have been exerted for the defence of Britain.
 Yet if the memory of its champions is almost buried in oblivion, we need not repine; since every age, however destitute of science or virtue, sufficiently abounds with acts of blood and military renown.
 The tomb of Vortimer, the son of Vortigern, was erected on the margin of the seashore, as a landmark formidable to the Saxons, whom he had thrice vanquished in the fields of Kent.
 Ambrosius Aurelian was descended from a noble family of Romans; (138) his modesty was equal to his valour, and his valour, till the last fatal action, (139) was crowned with splendid success.
 But every <NORP>British</NORP> name is effaced by the illustrious name of ARTHUR, (140) the hereditary prince of the Silures, in <LOC>South</LOC> <GPE>Wales</GPE> and the elective king or general of the nation.
 According to the most rational account, he defeated, in <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> successive battles, the <PERSON>Angles</PERSON> of the <LOC>North</LOC> and the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> of the West; but the declining age of the hero was embittered by popular ingratitude and domestic misfortunes.
 The events of his life are less interesting than the singular revolutions of his fame.
 During a period of five hundred years the tradition of his exploits was preserved, and rudely embellished, by the obscure bards of <GPE>Wales</GPE> and Armorica, who were odious to the Saxons, and unknown to the rest of mankind.
 The pride and curiosity of the <NORP>Norman</NORP> conquerors prompted them to inquire into the ancient history of Britain; they listened with fond credulity to the tale of Arthur, and eagerly applauded the merit of a prince who had triumphed over the Saxons, their common enemies.
 His romance, transcribed in the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> of Jeffrey of Monmouth, and afterwards translated into the fashionable idiom of the times, was enriched with the various, though incoherent, ornaments which were familiar to the experience, the learning, or the fancy of the twelfth century.
 The progress of a <NORP>Phrygian</NORP> colony, from the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> to the Thames, was easily engrafted on the fable of the Aeneid; and the royal ancestors of, <PERSON>Arthur</PERSON> derived their origin from Troy, and claimed their alliance with the Caesars.
 His trophies were decorated with captive provinces and <NORP>Imperial</NORP> titles; and his <NORP>Danish</NORP> victories avenged the recent injuries of his country.
 The gallantry and superstition of the <NORP>British</NORP> hero, his feasts and tournaments, and the memorable institution of his Knights of the Round Table, were faithfully copied from the reigning manners of chivalry; and the fabulous exploits of Uther's son appear less incredible than the adventures which were achieved by the enterprising valour of the Normans.
 Pilgrimage, and the holy wars, introduced into <LOC>Europe</LOC> the specious miracles of <NORP>Arabian</NORP> magic.
 Fairies and giants, flying dragons and enchanted palaces, were blended with the more simple fictions of the West; and the fate of <GPE>Britain</GPE> depended on the art, or the predictions, of Merlin.
 Every nation embraced and adorned the popular romance of <PERSON>Arthur</PERSON> and the Knights of the Round Table: their names were celebrated in <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Italy; and the voluminous tales of Sir <PERSON>Lancelot</PERSON> and Sir <PERSON>Tristram</PERSON> were devoutly studied by the princes and nobles who disregarded the genuine heroes and historians of antiquity.
 At length the light of science and reason was rekindled; the talisman was broken; the visionary fabric melted into air; and by a natural, though unjust, reverse of the public opinion, the severity of the present age is inclined to question the existence of Arthur.
 (141) Desolation of Britain.
 Resistance, if it cannot avert, must increase the miseries of conquest; and conquest has never appeared more dreadful and destructive than in the hands of the Saxons, who hated the valour of their enemies, disdained the faith of treaties, and violated, without remorse, the most sacred objects of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> worship.
 The fields of battle might be traced, almost in every district, by monuments of bones; the fragments of falling towers were stained with blood; the last of the Britons, without distinction of age or sex, was massacred, (142) in the ruins of Anderida; (143) and the repetition of such calamities was frequent and familiar under the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> heptarchy.
 The arts and religion, the laws and language, which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had so carefully planted in Britain, were extirpated by their barbarous successors.
 After the destruction of the principal churches, the bishops who had declined the crown of martyrdom retired with the holy relics into <GPE>Wales</GPE> and Armorica; the remains of their flocks were left destitute of any spiritual food; the practice, and even the remembrance, of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> were abolished; and the <NORP>British</NORP> clergy might obtain some comfort from the damnation of the idolatrous strangers.
 The kings of <GPE>France</GPE> maintained the privileges of their <NORP>Roman</NORP> subjects; but the ferocious <NORP>Saxons</NORP> trampled on the laws of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of the emperors.
 The proceedings of civil and criminal jurisdiction, the titles of honour the forms of office, the ranks of society, and even the domestic rights of marriage, testament, and inheritance, were finally suppressed; and the indiscriminate crowd of noble and plebeian slaves was governed by the traditionary customs which had been coarsely framed for the shepherds and pirates of Germany.
 The language of science, of business, and of conversation, which had been introduced by the Romans, was lost in the general desolation.
 A sufficient number of <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> or <NORP>Celtic</NORP> words might be assumed by the <NORP>Germans</NORP> to express their new wants and ideas; (144) but those illiterate <NORP>Pagans</NORP> preserved and established the use of their national dialect.
 (145) Almost every name, conspicuous either in the church or state, reveals its <NORP>Teutonic</NORP> origin; (146) and the geography of <GPE>England</GPE> was universally inscribed with foreign characters and appellations.
 The example of a revolution so rapid and so complete may not easily be found; but it will excite a probable suspicion that the arts of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were less deeply rooted in <GPE>Britain</GPE> than in <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> or Spain; and that the native rudeness of the country and its inhabitants was covered by a thin varnish of <NORP>Italian</NORP> manners.
 Servitude.
 This strange alteration has persuaded historians, and even philosophers, that the provincials of <GPE>Britain</GPE> were totally exterminated; and that the vacant land was again peopled by the perpetual influx and rapid increase of the <NORP>German</NORP> colonies.
 Three hundred thousand <NORP>Saxons</NORP> are said to have obeyed the summons of Hengist; (147) the entire emigration of the <PERSON>Angles</PERSON> was attested, in the age of Bede, by the solitude of their native country; (148) and our experience has shown the free propagation of the human race, if they are cast on a fruitful wilderness, where their steps are unconfined, and their subsistence is plentiful.
 The <NORP>Saxon</NORP> kingdoms displayed the face of recent discovery and cultivation: the towns were small, the villages were distant; the husbandry was languid and unskilful; <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> sheep were equivalent to an acre of the best land; (149) an ample space of wood and morass was resigned to the vague dominion of nature; and the modern bishopric of Durham, the whole territory from the <LOC>Tyne</LOC> to the Tees, had returned to its primitive state of a savage and solitary forest.
 (150) Such imperfect population might have been supplied, in some generations, by the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> colonies; but neither reason nor facts can justify the unnatural supposition that the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> of <GPE>Britain</GPE> remained alone in the desert which they had subdued.
 After the sanguinary barbarians had secured their dominion and gratified their revenge, it was their interest to preserve the peasants, as well as the cattle, of the unresisting country.
 In each successive revolution the patient herd becomes the property of its new masters; and the salutary compact of food and labour is silently ratified by their mutual necessities.
 Wilfrid, the apostle of Sussex, (151) accepted from his royal convert the gift of the peninsula of Selsey, near Chichester, with the persons and property of its inhabitants, who then amounted to <CARDINAL>eighty-seven</CARDINAL> families.
 He released them at once from spiritual and temporal bond-age; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> slaves of both sexes were baptised by their indulgent master.
 The kingdom of Sussex, which spread from the sea to the Thames, contained <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand families: <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> hundred were ascribed to the Isle of Wight; and, if we multiply this vague computation, it may seem probable that <GPE>England</GPE> was cultivated by a million of servants, or villains, who were attached to the estates of their arbitrary landlords.
 The indigent barbarians were often tempted to sell their children or themselves into perpetual, and even foreign, bondage; (152) yet the special exemptions which were granted to national slaves (153) sufficiently declare that they were much less numerous than the strangers and captives who had lost their liberty, or changed their masters, by the accidents of war.
 When time and religion had mitigated the fierce spirit of the Anglo-Saxons, the laws encouraged the frequent practice of manumission; and their subjects, of <NORP>Welsh</NORP> or <NORP>Cambrian</NORP> extraction, assumed the respectable station of inferior freemen, possessed of lands, and entitled to the rights of civil society.
 (154) Such gentle treatment might secure the allegiance of a fierce people, who had been recently subdued on the confines of <GPE>Wales</GPE> and Cornwall.
 The sage Ina, the legislator of Wessex, united the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations in the bands of domestic alliance; and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <NORP>British</NORP> lords of <NORP>Somersetshire</NORP> may be honourably distinguished in the court of a <NORP>Saxon</NORP> monarch.
 (155) Manners of the Britons.
The independent <NORP>Britons</NORP> appear to have relapsed into the state of original barbarism from whence they had been imperfectly reclaimed.
 Separated by their enemies from the rest of mankind, they soon became an object of scandal and abhorrence to the catholic world.
 (156) <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was still professed in the mountains of Wales; but the rude schismatics, in the form of the clerical tonsure, and in the day of the celebration of Easter, obstinately resisted the imperious mandates of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiffs.
 The use of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> language was insensibly abolished, and the <NORP>Britons</NORP> were deprived of the arts and learning which <GPE>Italy</GPE> communicated to her <NORP>Saxon</NORP> proselytes.
 In <GPE>Wales</GPE> and Armorica, the <NORP>Celtic</NORP> tongue, the native idiom of the West, was preserved and propagated; and the Bards, who had been the companions of the Druids, were still protected, in the sixteenth century, by the laws of Elizabeth.
 Their chief, a respectable officer of the courts of Pengwern, or Aberfraw, or Caermarthen, accompanied the king's servants to war: the monarchy of the Britons, which he sung in the front of battle, excited their courage, and justified their depredations; and the songster claimed for his legitimate prize the fairest heifer of the spoil.
 His subordinate ministers, the masters and disciples of vocal and instrumental music, visited, in their respective circuits, the royal, the noble, and the plebeian houses; and the public poverty, almost exhausted by the clergy, was oppressed by the importunate demands of the bards.
 Their rank and merit were ascertained by solemn trials, and the strong belief of supernatural inspiration exalted the fancy of the poet and of his audience.
 (157) The last retreats of <NORP>Celtic</NORP> freedom, the extreme territories of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Britain, were less adapted to agriculture than to pasturage: the wealth of the <NORP>Britons</NORP> consisted in their flocks and herds; milk and flesh were their ordinary food; and bread was sometimes esteemed, or rejected, as a foreign luxury.
 Liberty had peopled the mountains of <GPE>Wales</GPE> and the morasses of Armorica: but their populousness has been maliciously ascribed to the loose practice of polygamy; and the houses of these licentious barbarians have been supposed to contain <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> wives, and perhaps <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> children.
 (158) Their disposition was rash and choleric they were bold in action and in speech; (159) and as they were ignorant of the arts of peace, they alternately indulged their passions in foreign and domestic war.
 The cavalry of Armorica, the spearmen of Gwent, and the archers of Merioneth, were equally formidable; but their poverty could seldom procure either shields or helmets; and the inconvenient weight would have retarded the speed and agility of their desultory operations.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the greatest of the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> monarchs was requested to satisfy the curiosity of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor concerning the state of Britain; and Henry II.
 could assert, from his personal experience, that <GPE>Wales</GPE> was inhabited by a race of naked warriors, who encountered, without fear, the defensive armour of their enemies.
 (160) Obscure or fabulous state of Britain.
 By the revolution of <GPE>Britain</GPE> the limits of science as well as of empire were contracted.
 The dark cloud which had been cleared by the <NORP>Phoenician</NORP> discoveries, and finally dispelled by the arms of Caesar, again settled on the shores of the Atlantic, and a <NORP>Roman</NORP> province was again lost among the fabulous islands of the Ocean.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years after the reign of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> the gravest historian of the times (161) describes the wonders of a remote isle, whose eastern and western parts are divided by an antique wall, the boundary of life and death, or, more properly, of truth and fiction.
 The east is a fair country, inhabited by a civilised people: the air is healthy, the waters are pure and plentiful, and the earth yields her regular and fruitful increase.
 In the west, beyond the wall, the air is infectious and mortal; the ground is covered with serpents; and this dreary solitude is the region of departed spirits, who are transported , from the opposite shores in substantial boats and by living rowers.
 Some families of fishermen, the subjects of the Franks, are excused from tribute, in consideration of the mysterious office which is performed by these <NORP>Charons</NORP> of the ocean.
 Each in his turn is summoned, at the hour of midnight, to hear the voices, and even the names, of the ghosts: he is sensible of their weight, and he feels himself impelled by an unknown, but irresistible, power.
 After this dream of fancy, we read with astonishment that the name of this island is 'Brittia'; that it lies in the ocean, against the mouth of the Rhine, and less than <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> miles from the continent; that it is possessed by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> nations, the Frisians, the Angles, and the Britons; and that some <PERSON>Angles</PERSON> had appeared at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> in the train of the <NORP>French</NORP> ambassadors.
 From these ambassadors <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> might be informed of a singular, though not improbable, adventure, which announces the spirit, rather than the delicacy, of an <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> heroine.
 She had been betrothed to Radiger, king of the Varni, a tribe of <NORP>Germans</NORP> who touched the ocean and the Rhine; but the perfidious lover was tempted, by motives of policy, to prefer his father's widow, the sister of Theodebert, king of the Franks.
 (162) The forsaken princess of the Angles, instead of bewailing, revenged her disgrace.
 Her warlike subjects are said to have been ignorant of the use, and even of the form, of a horse; but she boldly sailed from <GPE>Britain</GPE> to the mouth of the Rhine, with a fleet of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred ships and an army of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred thousand men.
 After the loss of a battle, the captive <PERSON>Radiger</PERSON> implored the mercy of his victorious bride, who generously pardoned his offence, dismissed her rival, and compelled the king of the <PERSON>Varni</PERSON> to discharge with honour and fidelity the duties of a husband.
 (163) This gallant exploit appears to be the last naval enterprise of the Anglo-Saxons.
 The arts of navigation, by which they had acquired the empire of <GPE>Britain</GPE> and of the sea, were soon neglected by the indolent barbarians, who supinely renounced all the commercial advantages of their insular situation.
 <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> independent kingdoms were agitated by perpetual discord; and the <NORP>British</NORP> world was seldom connected, either in peace or war, with the nations of the continent.
 (164) Fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire in the West.
 I have now accomplished the laborious narrative of the decline and fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, from the fortunate age of <LOC>Trajan</LOC> and the <NORP>Antonines</NORP> to its total extinction in the West, about five centuries after the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era.
 At that unhappy period the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> fiercely struggled with the natives for the possession of Britain: <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> were divided between the powerful monarchies of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and <NORP>Visigoths</NORP> and the dependent kingdoms of the <NORP>Suevi</NORP> and Burgundians: <LOC>Africa</LOC> was exposed to the cruel persecution of the <NORP>Vandals</NORP> and the savage insults of the Moors: <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, as far as the banks of the Danube, were afflicted by an army of barbarian mercenaries, whose lawless tyranny was succeeded by the reign of <PERSON>Theodoric</PERSON> the Ostrogoth.
 All the subjects of the empire, who, by the use of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> language, more particularly deserved the name and privileges of Romans, were oppressed by the disgrace and calamities of foreign conquest; and the victorious nations of <GPE>Germany</GPE> established a new system of manners and government in the western countries of Europe.
 The majesty of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was faintly represented by the princes of Constantinople, the feeble and imaginary successors of Augustus.
 Yet they continued to reign over the East, from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the <LOC>Nile</LOC> and Tigris; the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> and <LOC>Vandal</LOC> kingdoms of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> were subverted by the arms of Justinian; and the history of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors may still afford a long series of instructive lessons and interesting revolutions.
