Last years and death of Honorius, A.
D.
 423, August <CARDINAL>27</CARDINAL> DURING a long and disgraceful reign of twenty-eight years, Honorius, emperor of the West, was separated from the friendship of his brother, and afterwards of his nephew, who reigned over the East; and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> beheld, with apparent indifference and secret joy, the calamities of Rome.
 The strange adventures of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> gradually renewed and cemented the alliance of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires.
 The daughter of the great <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> had been the captive and the queen of the Goths; she lost an affectionate husband; she was dragged in chains by his insulting assassin; she tasted the pleasure of revenge, and was exchanged, in the treaty of peace, for <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred thousand measures of wheat.
 After her return from <GPE>Spain</GPE> to Italy, <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> experienced a new persecution in the bosom of her family.
 She was averse to a marriage which had been stipulated without her consent; and the brave Constantius, as a noble reward for the tyrants whom he had vanquished, received, from the hand of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> himself, the struggling and reluctant hand of the widow of Adolphus.
 But her resistance ended with the ceremony of the nuptials; nor did <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> refuse to become the mother of <PERSON>Honoria</PERSON> and <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> the Third, or to assume and exercise an absolute dominion over the mind of her grateful husband.
 The generous soldier, whose time had hitherto been divided between social pleasure and military service, was taught new lessons of avarice and ambition: he extorted the title of Augustus; and the servant of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was associated to the empire of the West.
 The death of Constantius, in the seventh month of his reign, instead of diminishing, seemed to increase, the power of Placidia; and the indecent familiarity(1) of her brother, which might be no more than the symptoms of a childish affection, were universally attributed to incestuous love.
 On a sudden, by some base intrigues of a steward and a nurse, this excessive fondness was converted into an irreconcilable quarrel: the debates of the emperor and his sister were not long confined within the walls of the palace; and as the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldiers adhered to their queen, the city of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was agitated with bloody and dangerous tumults, which could only be appeased by the forced or voluntary retreat of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> and her children.
 The royal exiles landed at Constantinople, soon after the marriage of Theodosius, during the festival of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> victories.
 They were treated with kindness and magnificence; but as the statues of the emperor <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> had been rejected by the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> court, the title of <ORG>Augusta</ORG> could not decently be allowed to his widow.
 Within a few months after the arrival of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> a swift messenger announced the death of Honorius, the consequence of a dropsy; but the important secret was not divulged till the necessary orders had been despatched for the march of a large body of troops to the sea-coast of Dalmatia.
 The shops and the gates of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> remained shut during <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days; and the loss of a foreign prince, who could neither be esteemed nor regretted, was celebrated with loud and affected demonstrations of the public grief.
 Elevation and fall of the usurper John, A.
D.
 423-425 While the ministers of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> deliberated, the vacant throne of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was usurped by the ambition of a stranger.
 The name of the rebel was John; he filled the confidential office of Primicerius, or principal secretary; and history has attributed to his character more virtues than can easily be reconciled with the violation of the most sacred duty.
 Elated by the submission of Italy, and the hope of an alliance with the Huns, <PERSON>John</PERSON> presumed to insult by an embassy, the majesty of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> emperor; but when he understood that his agents had been banished, imprisoned, and at length chased away with deserved ignominy, <PERSON>John</PERSON> prepared to assert by arms the injustice of his claims.
 In such a cause the grandson of the great <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> should have marched in person; but the young emperor was easily diverted by his physicians from so rash and hazardous a design; and the conduct of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition was prudently intrusted to <PERSON>Ardaburius</PERSON> and his son Aspar, who had already signalised their valour against the Persians.
 It was resolved that <PERSON>Ardaburius</PERSON> should embark with the infantry; whilst Aspar, at the head of the cavalry, conducted Placidia, and her son Valentinian, along the sea-coast of the Hadriatic.
 The march of the cavalry was performed with such active diligence, that they surprised, without resistance, the important city of Aquileia; when the hopes of <PERSON>Aspar</PERSON> were unexpectedly confounded by the intelligence that a storm had dispersed the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> fleet, and that his father, with only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> galleys, was taken and carried a prisoner into the port of Ravenna.
 Yet this incident, unfortunate as it might seem, facilitated the conquest of Italy.
 <PERSON>Ardaburius</PERSON> employed, or abused, the courteous freedom which he was permitted to enjoy, to revive among the troops a sense of loyalty and gratitude; and, as soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution, he invited, by private messages, and pressed the approach of Aspar.
 A shepherd, whom the popular credulity transformed into an angel, guided the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> cavalry, by a secret, and, it was thought, an impassable road, through the morasses of the Po: the gates of Ravenna, after a short struggle, were thrown open; and the defenceless tyrant was delivered to the mercy, or rather to the cruelty, of the conquerors.
 His right hand was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> cut off, and after he had been exposed, mounted on an ass, to the public derision, <PERSON>John</PERSON> was beheaded in the circus of Aquileia.
 The emperor Theodosius, when he received the news of the victory, interrupted the horseraces; and singing, as he marched through the streets a suitable psalm, conducted his people from the <FAC>Hippodrome</FAC> to the church, where he spent the remainder of the day in grateful devotion.
(2) <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> III.
 Emperor of the West, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>425-455</CARDINAL> In a monarchy which, according to various precedents, might be considered as elective, or hereditary, or patrimonial, it was impossible that the intricate claims of female and collateral succession should be clearly defined; (3) and Theodosius, by the right of consanguinity or conquest, might have reigned the sole legitimate emperor of the Romans.
 For a moment, perhaps, his eyes were dazzled by the prospect of unbounded sway; but his indolent temper gradually acquiesced in the dictates of sound policy.
 He contented himself with the possession of the East; and wisely relinquished the laborious task of waging a distant and doubtful war against the barbarians beyond the Alps, or of securing the obedience of the <NORP>Italians</NORP> and Africans, whose minds were alienated by the irreconcilable difference of language and interest.
 Instead of listening to the voice of ambition, <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> resolved to imitate the moderation of his grandfather, and to seat his cousin <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> on the throne of the West.
 The royal infant was distinguished at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by the title of Nobilissimus: he was promoted, before his departure from Thessalonica, to the rank and dignity of Caesar: and, after the conquest of Italy, the patrician Helion, by the authority of Theodosius, and in the presence of the senate, saluted <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> by the name of Augustus, and solemnly invested him with the diadem and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple.
(4) By the agreement of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> females who governed the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, the son of <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> was betrothed to Eudoxia, the daughter of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> and Athenais; and, as soon as the lover and his bride had attained the age of puberty, this honourable alliance was faithfully accomplished.
 At the same time, as a compensation, perhaps, for the expenses of the war, the <NORP>Western</NORP> Illyricum was detached from the <NORP>Italian</NORP> dominions, and yielded to the throne of Constantinople.
(5) The emperor of the <LOC>East</LOC> acquired the useful dominion of the rich and maritime province of Dalmatia, and the dangerous sovereignty of <GPE>Pannonia</GPE> and Noricum, which had been filled and ravaged above twenty years by a promiscuous crowd of Huns, Ostrogoths Vandals, and Bavarians.
 <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> and <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> continued to respect the obligations of their public and domestic alliance; but the unity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government was finally dissolved.
 By a positive declaration, the validity of all future laws was limited to the dominions of their peculiar author; unless he should think proper to communicate them, subscribed with his own hand, for the approbation of his independent colleague.
(6) Administration of his mother Placidia, A.
D.
 425-450 Valentinian, when he received the title of Augustus, was no more than <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years of age; and his long minority was intrusted to the guardian care of a mother who might assert a female claim to the succession of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> envied, but she could not equal, the reputation and virtues of the wife and sister of Theodosius; the elegant genius of Eudocia, the wise and successful policy of Pulcheria.
 The mother of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> was jealous of the power which she was incapable of exercising:(7) she reigned twenty-five years, in the name of her son; and the character of that unworthy emperor gradually countenanced the suspicion that <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> had enervated his youth by a dissolute education, and studiously diverted his attention from every manly and honourable pursuit.
 Amidst the decay of military spirit, her armies were commanded by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals, Her <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> (8) and Boniface, (9) who may be deservedly named as the last of the Romans.
 Their union might have supported a sinking empire; their discord was the fatal and immediate cause of the loss of Africa.
 The invasion and defeat of <PERSON>Attila</PERSON> has immortalised the fame of Aetius; and though time has thrown a shade over the exploits of his rival, the defence of Marseilles, and the deliverance of Africa, attest the military talents of Count Boniface.
 In the field of battle, in partial encounters, in single combats, he was still the terror of the barbarians: the clergy, and particularly his friend Augustin, were edified by the <NORP>Christian</NORP> piety which had once tempted him to retire from the world; the people applauded his spotless integrity; the army dreaded his equal and inexorable justice, which may be displayed in a very singular example.
 A peasant, who complained of the criminal intimacy between his wife and a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldier, was directed to attend his tribunal the following day: in the evening the count, who had diligently informed himself of the time and place of the assignation, mounted his horse, rode ten miles into the country, surprised the guilty couple, punished the soldier with instant death, and silenced the complaints of the husband, by presenting him, the next morning, with the head of the adulterer.
 The abilities of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> might have been usefully employed against the public enemies in separate and important commands; but the experience of their past conduct should have decided the real favour and confidence of the empress Placidia.
 In the melancholy season of her exile and distress, <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> alone had maintained her cause with unshaken fidelity; and the troops and treasures of <LOC>Africa</LOC> had essentially contributed to extinguish the rebellion.
 The same rebellion had been supported by the zeal and activity of Aetius, who brought an army of sixty thousand <PERSON>Huns</PERSON> from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the confines of Italy, for the service of the usurper.
 The untimely death of <PERSON>John</PERSON> compelled him to accept an advantageous treaty, but he still continued, the subject and the soldier of Valentinian, to entertain a secret, perhaps a treasonable, correspondence with his barbarian allies, whose retreat had been purchased by liberal gifts and more liberal promises.
 But <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> possessed an advantage of singular moment in a female reign: he was present: he besieged with artful and assiduous flattery the palace of Ravenna; disguised his dark designs with the mask of loyalty and friendship; and at length deceived both his mistress and his absent rival, by a subtle conspiracy which a weak woman and a brave man could not easily suspect.
 Error and revolt of <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> in Africa, A.
D.
 427 He secretly persuaded (10) <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> to recall <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> from the government of Africa; he secretly advised <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> to disobey the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> summons: to the one, he represented the order as a sentence of death; to the other, he stated the refusal as a signal of revolt; and when the credulous and unsuspectful count had armed the province in his defence, <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> applauded his sagacity in foreseeing the rebellion which his own perfidy had excited.
 A temperate inquiry into the real motives of <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> would have restored a faithful servant to his duty and to the republic; but the arts of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> still continued to betray and to inflame, and the count was urged by persecution to embrace the most desperate counsels.
 The success with which he eluded or repelled the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attacks could not inspire a vain confidence that, at the head of some loose disorderly Africans, he should be able to withstand the regular forces of the West, commanded by a rival whose military character it was impossible for him to despise.
 After some hesitation, the last struggles of prudence and loyalty, <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> despatched a trusty friend to the court, or rather to the camp, of Gonderic, king of the Vandals, with the proposal of a strict alliance, and the offer of an advantageous and perpetual settlement.
 He invites the vandals, A.
D.
 428 After the retreat of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> the authority of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> had obtained a precarious establishment in Spain, except only in the province of Gallicia, where the <NORP>Suevi</NORP> and the <PERSON>Vandals</PERSON> had fortified their camps in mutual discord and hostile independence.
 The <PERSON>Vandals</PERSON> prevailed, and their adversaries were besieged in the <NORP>Nervasian</NORP> hills, between <GPE>Leon</GPE> and Oviedo, till the approach of Count <PERSON>Asterius</PERSON> compelled, or rather provoked, the victorious barbarians to remove the scene of the war to the plains of Baetica.
 The rapid progress of the <PERSON>Vandals</PERSON> soon required a more effectual opposition, and the master-general <PERSON>Castinus</PERSON> marched against them with a numerous army of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and Goths.
 Vanquished in battle by an inferior enemy, <PERSON>Castinus</PERSON> fled with dishonour to Tarragona; and this memorable defeat, which has been represented as the punishment, was most probably the effect, of his rash presumption.
 (11) <GPE>Seville</GPE> and <GPE>Carthagena</GPE> became the reward, or rather the prey, of the ferocious conquerors; and the vessels which they found in the harbour of <GPE>Carthagena</GPE> might easily transport them to the isles of <LOC>Majorca</LOC> and Minorca, where the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> fugitives, as in a secure recess, had vainly concealed their families and their fortunes.
 The experience of navigation, and perhaps the prospect of Africa, encouraged the <PERSON>Vandals</PERSON> to accept the invitation which they received from Count Boniface, and the death of <PERSON>Gonderic</PERSON> served only to forward and animate the bold enterprise.
 In the room of a prince not conspicuous for any superior powers of the mind or body, they acquired his bastard brother, Genseric, King Of The <PERSON>Vandals</PERSON> the terrible Genseric;(12) a name which in the destruction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire has reserved an equal rank with the names of <PERSON>Alaric</PERSON> and Attila.
 The king of the <PERSON>Vandals</PERSON> is described to have been of a middle stature, with a lameness in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> leg, which he had contracted by an accidental fall from his horse.
 His slow and cautious speech seldom declared the deep purposes of his soul: he disdained to imitate the luxury of the vanquished, but he indulged the sterner passions of anger and revenge.
 The ambition of <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> was without bounds and without scruples, and the warrior could dexterously employ the dark engines of policy to solicit the allies who might be useful to his success, or to scatter among his enemies the seeds of hatred and contention.
 Almost in the moment of his departure he was informed that Hermanric, king of the Suevi, had presumed to ravage the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> territories which he was resolved to abandon.
 Impatient of the insult, <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> pursued the hasty retreat of the <NORP>Suevi</NORP> as far as Merida, precipitated the king and his army into the river Anas, He lands in Africa, A.

 429, May, and calmly returned to the seashore to embark his victorious troops.
 The vessels which transported the <PERSON>Vandals</PERSON> over the modern Straits of Gibraltar, a channel only twelve miles in breadth, were furnished by the Spaniards, who anxiously wished their departure, and by the <NORP>African</NORP> general, who had implored their formidable assistance.
(13) and reviews his army, A.
D.
 429.
 Our fancy, so long accustomed to exaggerate and multiply the martial swarms of barbarians that seemed to issue from the North, will perhaps be surprised by the account of the army which <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> mustered on the coast of Mauritania.
 The Vandals, who in twenty years had penetrated from the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> to Mount Atlas, were united under the command of their warlike king; and he reigned with equal authority over the Alani, who had passed within the term of human life from the cold of <GPE>Scythia</GPE> to the excessive heat of an <NORP>African</NORP> climate.
 The hopes of the bold enterprise had excited many brave adventurers of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation, and many desperate provincials were tempted to repair their fortunes by the same means which had occasioned their ruin.
 Yet this various multitude amounted only to fifty thousand effective men; and though <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> artfully magnified his apparent strength by appointing <CARDINAL>eighty</CARDINAL> chiliarchs, or commanders of thousands, the fallacious increase of old men, of children, and of slaves, would scarcely have swelled his army to the number of four-score thousand persons.
(14) But his own dexterity and the discontents of <LOC>Africa</LOC> soon fortified the <NORP>Vandal</NORP> powers by the accession of numerous and active allies.
 The parts of <GPE>Mauritania</GPE> which border on the great desert and the <LOC>Atlantic</LOC> ocean, The <NORP>Moors</NORP> were filled with a fierce and untractable race of men, whose savage temper had been exasperated rather than reclaimed by their dread of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms.
 The wandering Moors, (15) as they gradually ventured to approach the seashore and the camp of the Vandals, must have viewed with terror and astonishment the dress, the armour, the martial pride and discipline of the unknown strangers who had landed on their coast; and the fair complexions of the blue-eyed warriors of <GPE>Germany</GPE> formed a very singular contrast with the swarthy or olive hue which is derived from the neighbourhood of the torrid zone, After the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> difficulties had in some measure been removed which arose from the mutual ignorance of their respective language, the Moors, regardless of any future consequence, embraced the alliance of the enemies of Rome, and a crowd of naked savages rushed from the woods and valleys of Mount Atlas, to satiate their revenge on the polished tyrants who had injuriously expelled them from the native sovereignty of the land.
 The <NORP>Donatists</NORP> The persecution of the <NORP>Donatists</NORP> (16) was an event not less favourable to the designs of Genseric.
 Seventeen years before he landed in Africa, a public conference was held at <GPE>Carthage</GPE> by the order of the magistrate.
 The <NORP>catholics</NORP> were satisfied that, after the invincible reasons which they had alleged, the obstinacy of the schismatics must be inexcusable and voluntary, and the emperor <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> was persuaded to inflict the most rigorous penalties on a faction which had so long abused his patience and clemency.
 Three hundred bishops, (17) with many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the inferior clergy, were torn from their churches, stripped of their ecclesiastical possessions, banished to the islands, and proscribed by the laws, if they presumed to conceal themselves in the provinces of Africa.
 Their numerous congregations, both in cities and in the country, were deprived of the rights of citizens and of the exercise of religious worship.
 A regular scale of fines, from ten to <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred pounds of silver, was curiously ascertained, according to the distinctions of rank and fortune, to punish the crime of assisting at a schismatic conventicle; and if the fine had been levied <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times without subduing the obstinacy of the offender, his future punishment was referred to the discretion of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> court.
(18) By these severities, which obtained the warmest approbation of St.
 Augustin,(19) great numbers of <NORP>Donatists</NORP> were reconciled to the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church; but the fanatics who still persevered in their opposition were provoked to madness and despair; the distracted country was filled with tumult and bloodshed; the armed troops of <NORP>Circumcellions</NORP> alternately pointed their rage against themselves or against their adversaries; and the calendar of martyrs received on both sides a considerable augmentation.
 (20) Under these circumstances Genseric, a Christian, but an enemy of the orthodox communion, showed himself to the <NORP>Donatists</NORP> as a powerful deliverer, from whom they might reasonably expect the repeal of the odious and oppressive edicts of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors.
(21) The conquest of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was facilitated by the active real or the secret favour of a domestic faction; the wanton outrages against the churches and the clergy, of which the <PERSON>Vandals</PERSON> are accused, may be fairly imputed to the fanaticism of their allies; and the intolerant spirit which disgraced the triumph of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> contributed to the loss of the most important province of the West.
(22) Tardy repentance of Boniface, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>430</CARDINAL> The court and the people were astonished by the strange intelligence that a virtuous hero, after so many favours and so many services, had renounced his allegiance and invited the barbarians to destroy the province entrusted to his command.
 The friends of Boniface, who still believed that his criminal behaviour might be excused by some honourable motive, solicited, during the absence of Aetius, a free conference with the Count of Africa; and Darius, an officer of high distinction, was named for the important embassy.
(23) In their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> interview at <GPE>Carthage</GPE> the imaginary provocations were mutually explained, the opposite letters of <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> were produced and compared, and the fraud was easily detected.
 <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> and <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> lamented their fatal error, and the count had sufficient magnanimity to confide in the forgiveness of his sovereign, or to expose his head to her future resentment.
 His repentance was fervent and sincere; but he soon discovered that it was no longer in his power to restore the edifice which he had shaken to its foundations.
 <GPE>Carthage</GPE> and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> garrisons returned with their general to the allegiance of Valentinian, but the rest of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was still distracted with war and faction; and the inexorable king of the Vandals, disdaining all terms of accommodation, sternly refused to relinquish the possession of his prey.
 The band of veterans who marched under the standard of Boniface, and his hasty levies of provincial troops, were defeated with considerable loss; the victorious barbarians insulted the open country; and Carthage, Cirta, and <GPE>Hippo</GPE> Regius, were the only cities that appeared to rise above the general inundation.
 Desolation of <LOC>Africa</LOC> The long and narrow tract of the <NORP>African</NORP> coast was filled with frequent monuments of <NORP>Roman</NORP> art and magnificence; and the respective degrees of improvement might be accurately measured by the distance from <GPE>Carthage</GPE> and the Mediterranean.
 A simple reflection will impress every thinking mind with the clearest idea of fertility and cultivation: the country was extremely populous; the inhabitants reserved a liberal subsistence for their own use; and the annual exportation, particularly of wheat, was so regular and plentiful, that <LOC>Africa</LOC> deserved the name of the common granary of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of mankind.
 On a sudden the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> fruitful provinces, from <GPE>Tangier</GPE> to Tripoli, were overwhelmed by the invasion of the Vandals, whose destructive rage has perhaps been exaggerated by popular animosity, religious zeal, and extravagant declamation.
 War in its fairest form implies a perpetual violation of humanity and justice; and the hostilities of barbarians are inflamed by the fierce and lawless spirit which incessantly disturbs their peaceful and domestic society.
 The Vandals, where they found resistance, seldom gave quarter; and the deaths of the valiant countrymen were expiated by the ruin of the cities under whose walls they had fallen.
 Careless of the distinction of age, or sex, or rank, they employed every species of indignity and torture to force from the captives a discovery of their hidden wealth.
 The stern policy of <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> justified his frequent examples of military execution: he was not always the master of his own passions or of those of his followers; and the calamities of war were aggravated by the licentiousness of the <NORP>Moors</NORP> and the fanaticism of the Donatists.
 Yet I shall not easily be persuaded that it was the common practice of the <PERSON>Vandals</PERSON> to extirpate the olives and other fruit trees of a country where they intended to settle: nor can I believe that it was a usual stratagem to slaughter great numbers of their prisoners before the walls of a besieged city, for the sole purpose of infecting the air and producing a pestilence, of which they themselves must have been the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> victims.
(24) Siege of Hippo, A.
D.
 430, May.
 The generous mind of Count <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> was tortured by the exquisite distress of beholding the ruin which he had occasioned, and whose rapid progress he was unable to check.
 After the loss of a battle he retired to <GPE>Hippo</GPE> Regius, where he was immediately besieged by an enemy who considered him as the real bulwark of Africa.
 The maritime colony of Hippo, (25) about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred miles westward of Carthage, had formerly acquired the distinguishing epithet of <PERSON>Regius</PERSON> from the residence of <NORP>Numidian</NORP> kings; and some remains of trade and populousness still adhere to the modern city, which is known in <LOC>Europe</LOC> by the corrupted name of Bona.
 The military labours and anxious reflections of Count <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> were alleviated by the edifying conversation of his friend St.
 Augustin;(26) till that bishop, the light and pillar of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church,Death of St.
 Augustin, A.
D.
 430, August 28.
 was gently released, in the third month of the siege and in the seventy-sixth year of his age, from the actual and the impending calamities of his country.
 The youth of <PERSON>Augustin</PERSON> had been stained by the vices and errors which he so ingenuously confesses; but from the moment of his conversion to that of his death the manners of the bishop of <GPE>Hippo</GPE> were pure and austere, and the most conspicuous of his virtues was an ardent zeal against heretics of every denomination—the Manichaeans, the Donatists, and the <NORP>Pelagians</NORP> against whom he waged a perpetual controversy.
 When the city, some months after his death was burnt by the Vandals, the library was fortunately saved which contained his voluminous writings—two hundred and thirty-two separate books or treatises on theological subjects, besides a complete exposition of the <WORK_OF_ART>Psalter</WORK_OF_ART> and the gospel, and a copious magazine of epistles and homilies.
 (27) According to the judgment of the most impartial critics, the superficial learning of <PERSON>Augustin</PERSON> was confined to the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> language;(28) and his style, though sometimes animated by the eloquence of passion, is usually clouded by false and affected rhetoric.
 But he possessed a strong, capacious, argumentative mind; he boldly sounded the dark abyss of grace, predestination, free-will, and original sin; and the rigid system of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> which he framed or restored(29) has been entertained with public applause and secret reluctance by the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> church.
(30) Defeat and retreat of Bonniface, A.
D.
 431.
 By the skill of Boniface, and perhaps by the ignorance of the Vandals, the siege of <GPE>Hippo</GPE> was protracted above fourteen months: the sea was continually open; and when the adjacent country had been exhausted by irregular rapine, the besiegers themselves were compelled by famine to relinquish their enterprise.
 The importance and danger of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were deeply felt by the regent of the West.
 <PERSON>Placidia</PERSON> implored the assistance of her <NORP>Eastern</NORP> ally and the <NORP>Italian</NORP> fleet and army were reinforced by Aspar, who sailed from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with a powerful armament.
 As soon as the force of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires was united under the command of Boniface, he boldly marched against the Vandals; and the loss of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> battle irretrievably decided the fate of Africa.
 He embarked with the precipitation of despair, and the people of <GPE>Hippo</GPE> were permitted, with their families and effects, to occupy the vacant place of the soldiers, the greatest part of whom were either slain or made prisoners by the Vandals.
 The count, whose fatal credulity had wounded the vitals of the republic, might enter the palace of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> with some anxiety, which was soon removed by the smiles of Placidia.
 <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> accepted with gratitude the rank of patrician and the dignity of master-general of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies; but he must have blushed at the sight of those medals in which he was represented with the name and attributes of victory.
 (31) The discovery of his fraud, the displeasure of the empress, and the distinguished favour of his rival, exasperated the haughty and perfidious soul of Aetius.
 He hastily returned from <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> to Italy, with a retinue, or rather With an army, of barbarian followers; and such was the weakness of the government, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals decided their private quarrel in a bloody battle.
 <PERSON>Boniface</PERSON> was successful; His death, A.
D.
 432 but he received in the conflict a mortal wound from the spear of his adversary, of which he expired within a few days, in such <NORP>Christian</NORP> and charitable sentiments that he exhorted his wife, a rich heiress of Spain, to accept <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> for her <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> husband.
 But <PERSON>Aetius</PERSON> could not derive any immediate advantage from the generosity of his dying enemy: he was proclaimed a rebel by the justice of Placidia; and though he attempted to defend some strong fortresses, erected on his patrimonial estate, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> power soon compelled him to retire into Pannonia, to the tents of his faithful Huns.
 The republic was deprived by their mutual discord of the service of her <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most illustrious champions.
(32) Progress of the <PERSON>Vandals</PERSON> in Africa, A.
D.
 431-439.
 It might naturally be expected, after the retreat of Boniface, that the <PERSON>Vandals</PERSON> would achieve without resistance or delay the conquest of Africa.
 Eight years however elapsed from the evacuation of <GPE>Hippo</GPE> to the reduction of Carthage.
 In the midst of that interval the ambitious Genseric, in the full tide of apparent prosperity, negotiated a treaty of peace, by which he gave his son <PERSON>Hunneric</PERSON> for an hostage, and consented to leave the <NORP>Western</NORP> emperor in the undisturbed possession of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> Mauritanias.
 (33) This moderation, which cannot be imputed to the justice, must be ascribed to the policy, of the conqueror.
 His throne was encompassed with domestic enemies, who accused the baseness of his birth, and asserted the legitimate claims of his nephews, the sons of Gonderic.
 Those nephews, indeed, he sacrificed to his safety, and their mother, the widow of the deceased king, was precipitated by his order into the river Ampsaga.
 But the public discontent burst forth in dangerous and frequent conspiracies; and the warlike tyrant is supposed to have shed more <NORP>Vandal</NORP> blood by the hand of the executioner than in the field of battle.
(34) The convulsions of Africa, which had favoured his attack, opposed the firm establishment of his power; and the various seditions of the <NORP>Moors</NORP> and Germans, the <NORP>Donatists</NORP> and catholics, continually disturbed or threatened the unsettled reign of the conqueror.
 As he advanced towards <GPE>Carthage</GPE> he was forced to withdraw his troops from the <NORP>Western</NORP> provinces; the sea-coast was exposed to the naval enterprises of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Italy; and, in the heart of Numidia, the strong inland city of <GPE>Cirta</GPE> still persisted in obstinate independence.
(35) These difficulties were gradually subdued by the spirit, the perseverance, and the cruelty of Genseric, who alternately: applied the arts of peace and war to the establishment of his <NORP>African</NORP> kingdom.
 He subscribed a solemn treaty, with the hope of deriving some advantage from the term of its continuance and the moment of its violation.
 The vigilance of his enemies was relaxed by the protestations of friendship which concealed his hostile approach; and <GPE>Carthage</GPE> was at length surprised by the Vandals, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred and eighty-five years after the destruction of the city and republic by the younger Scipio.
 (36) They Surprise Carthage, A.
D.
 439, October <CARDINAL>9</CARDINAL> A new city had arisen from its ruins, with the title of a colony; and though <GPE>Carthage</GPE> might yield to the royal prerogatives of Constantinople, and perhaps to the trade of Alexandria, or the splendour of Antioch, she still maintained the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> rank in the West; as the <GPE>Rome</GPE> (if we may use the style of contemporaries) of the <NORP>African</NORP> world.
 That wealthy and opulent metropolis (37) displayed, in a dependent condition, the image of a flourishing republic.
 <GPE>Carthage</GPE> contained the manufactures, the arms, and the treasures of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> provinces.
 A regular subordination of civil honours gradually ascended from the procurators of the streets and quarters of the city to the tribunal of the supreme magistrate, who, with the title of proconsul, represented the state and dignity of a consul of ancient Rome.
 Schools and gymnasia were instituted for the education of the <NORP>African</NORP> youth; and the liberal arts and manners, grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy, were publicly taught in the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> and <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> languages.
 The buildings of <GPE>Carthage</GPE> were uniform and magnificent: a shady grove was planted in the midst of the capital; the new port, a secure and capacious harbour, was subservient to the commercial industry of citizens and strangers; and the splendid games of the circus and theatre were exhibited almost in the presence of the barbarians.
 The reputation of the <NORP>Carthaginians</NORP> was not equal to that of their country, and the reproach of <NORP>Punic</NORP> faith still adhered to their subtle and faithless character.
 (38) The habits of trade and the abuse of luxury had corrupted their manners; but their impious contempt of monks and the shameless practice of unnatural lusts are the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> abominations which excite the pious vehemence of Salvian, the preacher of the age.
(39) The king of the <PERSON>Vandals</PERSON> severely reformed the vices of a voluptuous people; and the ancient, noble, ingenuous freedom of <GPE>Carthage</GPE> (these expressions of <PERSON>Victor</PERSON> are not without energy) was reduced by <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> into a state of ignominious servitude.
 After he had permitted his licentious troops to satiate their rage and avarice, he instituted a more regular system of rapine and oppression.
 An edict was promulgated, which enjoined all persons, without fraud or delay, to deliver their gold, silver, jewels, and valuable furniture or apparel to the royal officers; and the attempt to secrete any part of their patrimony was inexorably punished with death and torture as an act of treason against the state.
 The lands of the proconsular province, which formed the immediate district of Carthage, were accurately measured and divided among the barbarians; and the conqueror reserved for his peculiar domain the fertile territory of <GPE>Byzacium</GPE> and the adjacent parts of <GPE>Numidia</GPE> and Gaetulia.
(40) <NORP>African</NORP> exiles and captives.
 It was natural enough that <PERSON>Genseric</PERSON> should hate those whom he had injured: the nobility and senators of Carthage, were exposed to his jealousy and resentment; and all those who refused the ignominious terms which their honour and religion forbade them to accept were compelled by the <NORP>Arian</NORP> tyrant to embrace the condition of perpetual banishment.
 Rome, Italy, and the provinces of the East, were filled with a crowd of exiles, of fugitives and of ingenuous captives, who solicited the public compassion: and the benevolent epistles of <PERSON>Theodoret</PERSON> still preserve the names and misfortunes of <PERSON>Caelestian</PERSON> and Maria.
 (41) The <NORP>Syrian</NORP> bishop deplores the misfortunes of Caelestian, who, from the state of a noble and opulent senator of Carthage, was reduced, with his wife, and family, and servants, to beg his bread in a foreign country; but he applauds the resignation of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> exile, and the philosophic temper which, under the pressure of such calamities, could enjoy more real happiness than was the ordinary lot of wealth and prosperity.
 The story of Maria, the daughter of the magnificent Eudaemon, is singular and interesting.
 In the sack of <GPE>Carthage</GPE> she was purchased from the <PERSON>Vandals</PERSON> by some merchants of Syria, who afterwards sold her as a slave in their native country.
 A female attendant, transported in the same ship, and sold in the same family, still continued to respect a mistress whom fortune had reduced to the common level of servitude; and the daughter of <PERSON>Eudaemon</PERSON> received from her grateful affection the domestic services which she had once required from her obedience.
 This remarkable behaviour divulged the real condition of Maria, who, in the absence of the bishop of Cyrrhus, was redeemed from slavery by the generosity of some soldiers of the garrison.
 The liberality of <PERSON>Theodoret</PERSON> provided for her decent maintenance; and she passed ten months among the deaconesses of the church, till she was unexpectedly informed that her father, who had escaped from the ruin of Carthage, exercised an honourable office in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Western</NORP> provinces.
 Her filial impatience was seconded by the pious bishop: Theodoret, in a letter still extant, recommends <PERSON>Maria</PERSON> to the bishop of Aegae, a maritime city of Cilicia, which was frequented, during the annual fair, by the vessels of the West; most earnestly requesting that his colleague would use the maiden with a tenderness suitable to her birth; and that he would intrust her to the care of such faithful merchants as would esteem it a sufficient gain if they restored a daughter, lost beyond all human hope, to the arms of her afflicted parent.
 Fable of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> sleepers.
 Among the insipid legends of ecclesiastical history, I am tempted to distinguish the memorable fable of the <CARDINAL>SEVEN</CARDINAL> SLEEPERS;(42) whose imaginary date corresponds with the reign of the younger Theodosius, and the conquest of <LOC>Africa</LOC> by the Vandals.
 (43) When the emperor <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> persecuted the Christians, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> noble youths of <GPE>Ephesus</GPE> concealed themselves in a spacious cavern in the side of an adjacent mountain where they were doomed to perish by the tyrant, who gave orders that the entrance should be firmly secured with a pile of huge stones.
 They immediately fell into a deep slumber, which was miraculously prolonged, without injuring the powers of life, during a period of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and eighty-seven years.
 At the end of that time, the slaves of Adolius, to whom the inheritance of the mountain had descended, removed the stones, to supply materials for some rustic edifice: the light of the sun darted into the cavern, and the <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> Sleepers were permitted to awake.
 After a slumber, as they thought of a few hours, they were pressed by the calls of hunger; and resolved that Jamblichus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their number, should secretly return to the city to purchase bread for the use of his companions.
 The youth (if we may still employ that appellation) could no longer recognise the once familiar aspect of his native country; and his surprise was increased by the appearance of a large cross, triumphantly erected over the principal gate of Ephesus.
 His singular dress and obsolete language confounded the baker, whom he offered an ancient medal of <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> the current coin of the empire; and Jamblichus, on the suspicion of a secret treasure, was dragged before the judge.
 Their mutual inquiries produced the amazing discovery that <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> centuries were almost elapsed since <PERSON>Jamblichus</PERSON> and his friends had escaped from the rage of a <NORP>Pagan</NORP> tyrant.
 The bishop of Ephesus, the clergy, the magistrates, the people, and, as it is said, the emperor <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> himself, hastened to visit the cavern of the <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> Sleepers; who bestowed their benediction, related their story, and at the same instant peaceably expired.
 The origin of this marvellous fable cannot be ascribed to the pious fraud and credulity of the modern Greeks, since the authentic tradition may be traced within half a century of the supposed miracle.
 James of Sarug, a <NORP>Syrian</NORP> bishop, who was born only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years after the death of the younger Theodosius, has devoted <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and thirty homilies to the praise of the young men of Ephesus.
(44) Their legend, before the end of the sixth century, was translated from the <LANGUAGE>Syriac</LANGUAGE> into the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> language, by the care of Gregory of Tours.
 The hostile communions of the <LOC>East</LOC> preserve their memory with equal reverence; and their names are honourably inscribed in the Roman, the Abyssinian, and the <NORP>Russian</NORP> calendar.
(45) Nor has their reputation been confined to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world.
 This popular tale, which <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> might learn when he drove his camels to the fairs of Syria, is introduced, as a divine revelation, into the Koran.
 (46) The story of the <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> Sleepers has been adopted and adorned by the nations, from <LOC>Bengal</LOC> to Africa, who profess the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> religion;(47) and some vestiges of a similar tradition have been discovered in the remote extremities of Scandinavia.
 (48) This easy and universal belief, so expressive of the sense of mankind, may be ascribed to the genuine merit of the fable itself.
 We imperceptibly advance from youth to age without observing the gradual, but incessant, change of human affairs; and even in our larger experience of history, the imagination is accustomed, by a perpetual series of causes and effects, to unite the most distant revolutions.
 But if the interval between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> memorable eras could be instantly annihilated; if it were possible, after a momentary slumber of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred years, to display the new world to the eyes of a spectator who still retained a lively and recent impression of the old, his surprise and his reflections would furnish the pleasing subject of a philosophical romance.
 The scene could not be more advantageously placed than in the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> centuries which elapsed between the reigns of <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> and of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> the Younger.
 During this period the seat of government had been transported from <GPE>Rome</GPE> to a new city on the banks of the Thracian Bosphorus and the abuse of military spirit had been suppressed by an artificial system of tame and ceremonious servitude.
 The throne of the persecuting <PERSON>Decius</PERSON> was filled by a succession of <NORP>Christian</NORP> and orthodox princes, who had extirpated the fabulous gods of antiquity: and the public devotion of the age was impatient to exalt the saints and martyrs of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church on the altars of <PERSON>Diana</PERSON> and Hercules.
 The union of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire was dissolved; its genius was humbled in the dust; and armies of unknown barbarians, issuing from the frozen regions of the North, had established their victorious reign over the fairest provinces of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Africa.
