 THE TURKS From the Isle of Sicily, the reader must transport himself beyond the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> Sea, to the original seat of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> or Turkmans, against whom the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade was principally directed.
 Their <NORP>Scythian</NORP> empire of the sixth century was long since dissolved; but the name was still famous among the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Orientals; and the fragments of the nation, each a powerful and independent people, were scattered over the desert from <GPE>China</GPE> to the <PERSON>Oxus</PERSON> and the Danube: the colony of <NORP>Hungarians</NORP> was admitted into the republic of Europe, and the thrones of <LOC>Asia</LOC> were occupied by slaves and soldiers of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> extraction.
 While <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and <GPE>Sicily</GPE> were subdued by the <NORP>Norman</NORP> lance, a swarm of these northern shepherds overspread the kingdoms of Persia; their princes of the race of <PERSON>Seljuk</PERSON> erected a splendid and solid empire from <NORP>Samarcand</NORP> to the confines of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Egypt; and the <NORP>Turks</NORP> have maintained their dominion in <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, till the victorious crescent has been planted on the dome of St.
 Sophia.
 Mahmud, the Gaznevide, A.
D.
 997-1028.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the greatest of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> princes was <PERSON>Mahmood</PERSON> or Mahmud, (1) the Gaznevide, who reigned in the eastern provinces of Persia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand years after the birth of Christ.
 His father <PERSON>Sebectagi</PERSON> was the slave of the slave of the slave of the commander of the faithful.
 But in this descent of servitude, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> degree was merely titular, since it was filled by the sovereign of <LOC>Transoxiana</LOC> and Chorasan, who still paid a nominal allegiance to the caliph of Bagdad.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> rank was that of a minister of state, a lieutenant of the Samanides, (2) who broke, by his revolt, the bonds of political slavery.
 But the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> step was a state of real and domestic servitude in the family of that rebel; from which Sebectagi, by his courage and dexterity, ascended to the supreme command of the city and provinces of Gazna, (3) as the son-in-law and successor of his grateful master.
 The falling dynasty of the <PRODUCT>Samanides</PRODUCT> was at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> protected, and at last overthrown, by their servants; and, in the public disorders, the fortune of <PERSON>Mahmud</PERSON> continually increased.
 From him the title of <PERSON>Sultan</PERSON> (4) was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invented; and his kingdom was enlarged from <LOC>Transoxiana</LOC> to the neighbourhood of Ispahan, from the shores of the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> to the mouth of the Indus.
 But the principal source of his fame and riches was the holy war which he waged against the <NORP>Gentoos</NORP> of Hindostan.
 In this foreign narrative I may not consume a page; His <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> expeditions into Hindostan.
 and a volume would scarcely suffice to recapitulate the battles and sieges of his <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> expeditions.
 Never was the <PERSON>Mussulman</PERSON> hero dismayed by the inclemency of the seasons, the height of the mountains, the breadth of the rivers, the barrenness of the desert, the multitudes of the enemy, or the formidable array of their elephants of war.
 (5) The sultan of <GPE>Gazna</GPE> surpassed the limits of the conquests of Alexander: after a march of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months, over the hills of <GPE>Cashmir</GPE> and Thibet, he reached the famous city of Kinnoge, (6) on the Upper Ganges; and, in a naval combat on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the branches of the Indus, he fought and vanquished <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand boats of the natives.
 Delhi, Lahor, and Multan, were compelled to open their gates: the fertile kingdom of <GPE>Guzarat</GPE> attracted his ambition and tempted his stay; and his avarice indulged the fruitless project of discovering the golden and aromatic isles of the Southern Ocean.
 On the payment of a tribute, the rajahs preserved their dominions; the people, their lives and fortunes; but to the religion of <GPE>Hindostan</GPE> the zealous <PERSON>Mussulman</PERSON> was cruel and inexorable: many <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> temples, or pagodas, were levelled with the ground; many thousand idols were demolished; and the servants of the prophet were stimulated and rewarded by the precious materials of which they were composed.
 The pagoda of <GPE>Sumnat</GPE> was situate on the promontory of Guzarat, in the neighbourhood of Diu, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the last remaining possessions of the Portuguese.
 (7) It was endowed with the revenue of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand villages; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Brahmins</NORP> were consecrated to the service of the Deity, whom they washed each morning and <TIME>evening</TIME> in water from the distant Ganges: the subordinate ministers consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> musicians, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> barbers, and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> dancing girls, conspicuous for their birth or beauty.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> sides of the temple were protected by the ocean, the narrow isthmus was fortified by a natural or artificial precipice; and the city and adjacent country were peopled by a nation of fanatics.
 They confessed the sins and the punishment of <PERSON>Kinnoge</PERSON> and Delhi; but if the impious stranger should presume to approach their holy precincts, he would surely be overwhelmed by a blast of the divine vengeance.
 By this challenge, the faith of <PERSON>Mahmud</PERSON> was animated to a personal trial of the strength of this <NORP>Indian</NORP> deity.
 Fifty thousand of his worshippers were pierced by the spear of the Moslems; the walls were scaled; the sanctuary was profaned; and the conqueror aimed a blow of his iron mace at the head of the idol.
 The trembling <NORP>Brahmins</NORP> are said to have offered <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> sterling for his ransom; and it was urged by the wisest counsellors, that the destruction of a stone image would not change the hearts of the Gentoos; and that such a sum might be dedicated to the relief of the true believers.
 He repeated his blows, and a treasure of pearls and rubies, concealed in the belly of the statue, explained in some degree the devout prodigality of the Brahmins.
 The fragments of the idol were distributed to Gazna, Mecca, and Medina.
 <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> listened to the edifying tale; and <PERSON>Mahmud</PERSON> was saluted by the caliph with the title of guardian of the fortune and faith of Mahomet.
 His character.
 From the paths of blood (and such is the history of nations) I cannot refuse to turn aside to gather some flowers of science or virtue.
 The name of <PERSON>Mahmud</PERSON> the <PERSON>Gaznevide</PERSON> is still venerable in the East: his subjects enjoyed the blessings of prosperity and peace; his vices were concealed by the veil of religion; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> familiar examples will testify his justice and magnanimity.
 I.
 As he sat in the Divan, an unhappy subject bowed before the throne to accuse the insolence of a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> soldier who had driven him from his house and bed.
 The sultan followed his guide, invested the house with his guards, and extinguishing the torches, pronounced the death of the criminal, who had been seized in the act of rapine and adultery.
 After the execution of his sentence, the lights were rekindled, <PERSON>Mahmud</PERSON> fell prostrate in prayer, and rising from the ground, demanded some homely fare, which he devoured with the voraciousness of hunger.
 The poor man, whose injury he had avenged, was unable to suppress his astonishment and curiosity; and the courteous monarch condescended to explain the motives of this singular behaviour.
 II.
 The sultan of <GPE>Gazna</GPE> had declared war against the dynasty of the Bowides, the sovereigns of the western Persia: he was disarmed by an epistle of the sultana mother, and delayed his invasion till the manhood of her son.
 (8) Avarice was the only defect that tarnished the illustrious character of Mahmud; and never has that passion been more richly satiated.
 The <NORP>Orientals</NORP> exceed the measure of credibility in the account of <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of gold and silver, such as the avidity of man has never accumulated; in the magnitude of pearls, diamonds, and rubies, such as have never been produced by the workmanship of nature.
 (9) Yet the soil of <GPE>Hindostan</GPE> is impregnated with precious minerals: her trade, in every age, has attracted the gold and silver of the world; and her virgin spoils were rifled by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> conquerors.
 His behaviour, in the last <DATE>days</DATE> of his life, evinces the vanity of these possessions, so laboriously won, so dangerously held, and so inevitably lost.
 He surveyed the vast and various chambers of the treasury of Gazna, burst into tears, and again closed the doors, without bestowing any portion of the wealth which he could no longer hope to preserve.
 The following day he reviewed the state of his military force; <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand foot, fifty-five thousand horse, and thirteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> elephants of battle.
 (10) He again wept the instability of human greatness; and his grief was embittered by the hostile progress of the Turkmans, whom he had introduced into the heart of his <NORP>Persian</NORP> kingdom.
 Manners and emigration of the Turks, or Turkmans, A.
D.
 980-1028.
 In the modern depopulation of Asia, the regular operation of government and agriculture is confined to the neighbourhood of cities; and the distant country is abandoned to the pastoral tribes of Arabs, Curds, and Turkmans.
 (11) Of the last-mentioned people, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> considerable branches extend on either side of the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> Sea: the western colony can muster forty thousand soldiers; the eastern, less obvious to the traveller, but more strong and populous, has increased to the number of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand families.
 In the midst of civilized nations, they preserve the manners of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> desert, remove their encampments with a change of seasons, and feed their cattle among the ruins of palaces and temples.
 Their flocks and herds are their only riches; their tents, either black or white, according to the colour of the banner, are covered with felt, and of a circular form; their winter apparel is a sheep-skin; a robe of cloth or cotton their <DATE>summer</DATE> garment: the features of the men are harsh and ferocious; the countenance of their women is soft and pleasing.
 Their wandering life maintains the spirit and exercise of arms; they fight on horseback; and their courage is displayed in frequent contests with each other and with their neighbours.
 For the license of pasture they pay a slight tribute to the sovereign of the land; but the domestic jurisdiction is in the hands of the chiefs and elders.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emigration of the Eastern Turkmans, the most ancient of the race, may be ascribed to the tenth century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era.
 (12) In the decline of the caliphs, and the weakness of their lieutenants, the barrier of the <NORP>Jaxartes</NORP> was often violated; in each invasion, after the victory or retreat of their countrymen, some wandering tribe, embracing the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> faith, obtained a free encampment in the spacious plains and pleasant climate of <LOC>Transoxiana</LOC> and Carizme.
 The <NORP>Turkish</NORP> slaves who aspired to the throne encouraged these emigrations which recruited their armies, awed their subjects and rivals, and protected the frontier against the wilder natives of Turkestan; and this policy was abused by <PERSON>Mahmud</PERSON> the <PERSON>Gaznevide</PERSON> beyond the example of former times.
 He was admonished of his error by the chief of the race of Seljuk, who dwelt in the territory of Bochara.
 The sultan had inquired what supply of men he could furnish for military service.
 The apprehension of such formidable friendship induced <PERSON>Mahmud</PERSON> to transport the most obnoxious tribes into the heart of Chorasan, where they would be separated from their brethren by the River Oxus, and enclosed on all sides by the walls of obedient cities.
 But the face of the country was an object of temptation rather than terror; and the vigour of government was relaxed by the absence and death of the sultan of Gazna.
 The shepherds were converted into robbers; the bands of robbers were collected into an army of conquerors: as far as <GPE>Ispahan</GPE> and the Tigris, <GPE>Persia</GPE> was afflicted by their predatory inroads; and the <NORP>Turkmans</NORP> were not ashamed or afraid to measure their courage and numbers with the proudest sovereigns of Asia.
 Massoud, the son and successor of Mahmud, had too long neglected the advice of his wisest Omrahs.
 After some alternatives of truce and hostility, after the repulse or partial success of his lieutenants, the sultan marched in person against the Turkmans, who attacked him on all sides with barbarous shouts and irregular onset.
They defeat the Gaznevides, and subdue Persia, A.
D.
 1038.
 The <PERSON>Gaznevide</PERSON> was abandoned by the cowardice or treachery of some generals of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> race; and this memorable day of <PERSON>Zendecan</PERSON> (14) founded in <GPE>Persia</GPE> the dynasty of the shepherd kings.
 (15)Dynasty of the Seljukians, A.
D.
 1038-1152.
 The victorious <NORP>Turkmans</NORP> immediately proceeded to the election of a king; and, if the probable tale of a <NORP>Latin</NORP> historian (16) deserves any credit, they determined by lot the choice of their new master.
 A number of arrows were successively inscribed with the name of a tribe, a family, and a candidate; they were drawn from the bundle by the hand of a child; and the important prize was obtained by <PERSON>Togrul</PERSON> Beg, the son of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the son of Seljuk, whose surname was immortalized in the greatness of his posterity.
 The sultan Mahmud, who valued himself on his skill in national genealogy, professed his ignorance of the family of Seljuk; yet the father of that race appears to have been a chief of power and renown.
 (17) For a daring intrusion into the harem of his prince, <PERSON>Seljuk</PERSON> was banished from Turkestan: with a numerous tribe of his friends and vassals, he passed the Jaxartes, encamped in the neighbourhood of Samarcand, embraced the religion of Mahomet, and acquired the crown of martyrdom in a war against the infidels.
 His age, of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years, surpassed the life of his son, and <PERSON>Seljuk</PERSON> adopted the care of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> grandsons, Reign and character of <PERSON>Togrul</PERSON> Beg, A.
D.
 1038-1063.
 <PERSON>Togrul</PERSON> and Jaafar; the eldest of whom, at the age of forty-five, was invested with the title of Sultan, in the royal city of Nishabur.
 The blind determination of chance was justified by the virtues of the successful candidate.
 It would be superfluous to praise the valour of a Turk; and the ambition of <PERSON>Togrul</PERSON> (18) was equal to his valour.
 By his arms, the <NORP>Gasnevides</NORP> were expelled from the eastern kingdoms of Persia, and gradually driven to the banks of the Indus, in search of a softer and more wealthy conquest.
 In the <LOC>West</LOC> he annihilated the dynasty of the Bowides; and the sceptre of <PERSON>Irak</PERSON> passed from the <NORP>Persian</NORP> to the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> nation.
 The princes who had felt, or who feared, the <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> arrows, bowed their heads in the dust; by the conquest of Aderbijan, or Media, he approached the <NORP>Roman</NORP> confines; and the shepherd presumed to despatch an ambassador, or herald, to demand the tribute and obedience of the emperor of Constantinople.
 (19) In his own dominions, <PERSON>Togrul</PERSON> was the father of his soldiers and people; by a firm and equal administration, <GPE>Persia</GPE> was relieved from the evils of anarchy; and the same hands which had been imbrued in blood became the guardians of justice and the public peace.
 The more rustic, perhaps the wisest, portion of the <NORP>Turkmans</NORP> (20) continued to dwell in the tents of their ancestors; and, from the <PERSON>Oxus</PERSON> to the Euphrates, these military colonies were protected and propagated by their native princes.
 But the <NORP>Turks</NORP> of the court and city were refined by business and softened by pleasure: they imitated the dress, language, and manners of Persia; and the royal palaces of <PERSON>Nishabur</PERSON> and <PERSON>Rei</PERSON> displayed the order and magnificence of a great monarchy.
 The most deserving of the <NORP>Arabians</NORP> and <NORP>Persians</NORP> were promoted to the honours of the state; and the whole body of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> nation embraced, with fervour and sincerity, the religion of Mahomet.
 The northern swarms of Barbarians, who overspread both <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, have been irreconcilably separated by the consequences of a similar conduct.
 Among the Moslems, as among the Christians, their vague and local traditions have yielded to the reason and authority of the prevailing system, to the fame of antiquity, and the consent of nations.
 But the triumph of the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> is more pure and meritorious, as it was not assisted by any visible splendour of worship which might allure the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> by some resemblance of idolatry.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> sultans was conspicuous by his zeal and faith: each day he repeated the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> prayers which are enjoined to the true believers; of each week, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <DATE>days</DATE> were consecrated by an extraordinary fast; and in every city a mosch was completed, before <PERSON>Togrul</PERSON> presumed to lay the foundations of a palace.
 (21) He delivers the caliph of Bagdad, A.
D.
 1055.
 With the belief of the Koran, the son of <PERSON>Seljuk</PERSON> imbibed a lively reverence for the successor of the prophet.
 But that sublime character was still disputed by the caliphs of <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> and Egypt, and each of the rivals was solicitous to prove his title in the judgment of the strong, though illiterate Barbarians.
 <PERSON>Mahmud</PERSON> the <PERSON>Gaznevide</PERSON> had declared himself in favour of the line of Abbas; and had treated with indignity the robe of honour which was presented by the <PERSON>Fatimite</PERSON> ambassador.
 Yet the ungrateful <PERSON>Hashemite</PERSON> had changed with the change of fortune; he applauded the victory of Zendecan, and named the <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> sultan his temporal vicegerent over the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> world.
 As <PERSON>Togrul</PERSON> executed and enlarged this important trust, he was called to the deliverance of the caliph Cayem, and obeyed the holy summons, which gave a new kingdom to his arms.
 (22) In the palace of Bagdad, the commander of the faithful still slumbered, a venerable phantom.
 His servant or master, the prince of the Bowides, could no longer protect him from the insolence of meaner tyrants; and the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> and <LOC>Tigris</LOC> were oppressed by the revolt of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> and <NORP>Arabian</NORP> emirs.
 The presence of a conqueror was implored as a blessing; and the transient mischiefs of fire and sword were excused as the sharp but salutary remedies which alone could restore the health of the republic.
 At the head of an irresistible force, the sultan of <GPE>Persia</GPE> marched from Hamadan: the proud were crushed, the prostrate were spared; the prince of the <PERSON>Bowides</PERSON> disappeared; the heads of the most obstinate rebels were laid at the feet of Togrul; and he inflicted a lesson of obedience on the people of <GPE>Mosul</GPE> and Bagdad.
 After the chastisement of the guilty, and the restoration of peace, His investiture.
 the royal shepherd accepted the reward of his labours; and a solemn comedy represented the triumph of religious prejudice over <PERSON>Barbarian</PERSON> power.
 (23) The <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan embarked on the Tigris, landed at the gate of Racca, and made his public entry on horseback.
 At the palace-gate he respectfully dismounted, and walked on foot, preceded by his emirs without arms.
 The caliph was seated behind his black veil: the black garment of the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> was cast over his shoulders, and he held in his hand the staff of the apostle of God.
 The conqueror of the <LOC>East</LOC> kissed the ground, stood some time in a modest posture, and was led towards the throne by the vizier and interpreter.
 After <PERSON>Togrul</PERSON> had seated himself on another throne, his commission was publicly read, which declared him the temporal lieutenant of the vicar of the prophet.
 He was successively invested with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> robes of honour, and presented with <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> slaves, the natives of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> climates of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> empire.
 His mystic veil was perfumed with musk; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> crowns were placed on his head; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> cimeters were girded to his side, as the symbols of a double reign over the <LOC>East</LOC> and West.
 After this inauguration, the sultan was prevented from prostrating himself a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time; but he twice kissed the hand of the commander of the faithful, and his titles were proclaimed by the voice of heralds and the applause of the Moslems.
 In a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> visit to Bagdad, the <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> prince again rescued the caliph from his enemies and devoutly, on foot, led the bridle of his mule from the prison to the palace.
 Their alliance was cemented by the marriage of Togrul's sister with the successor of the prophet.
 Without reluctance he had introduced a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> virgin into his harem; but <PERSON>Cayem</PERSON> proudly refused his daughter to the sultan, disdained to mingle the blood of the <NORP>Hashemites</NORP> with the blood of a <NORP>Scythian</NORP> shepherd; and protracted the negotiation many months, till the gradual diminution of his revenue admonished him that he was still in the hands of a master.
 and death, A.
D.
 1063.
 The royal nuptials were followed by the death of <PERSON>Togrul</PERSON> himself; (24) as he left no children, his nephew Alp Arslan succeeded to the title and prerogatives of sultan; and his name, after that of the caliph, was pronounced in the public prayers of the Moslems.
 Yet in this revolution, the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> acquired a larger measure of liberty and power.
 On the throne of Asia, the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> monarchs were less jealous of the domestic administration of Bagdad; and the commanders of the faithful were relieved from the ignominious vexations to which they had been exposed by the presence and poverty of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> dynasty.
 The <NORP>Turks</NORP> invade the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 1050.
 Since the fall of the caliphs, the discord and degeneracy of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> respected the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> provinces of Rome; which, by the victories of Nicephorus, Zimisces, and Basil, had been extended as far as <GPE>Antioch</GPE> and the eastern boundaries of Armenia.
 Twenty-five years after the death of Basil, his successors were suddenly assaulted by an unknown race of Barbarians, who united the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> valour with the fanaticism of new proselytes, and the art and riches of a powerful monarchy.
 (25) The myriads of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> horse overspread a frontier of six <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles from <GPE>Tauris</GPE> to Arzeroum, and the blood of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Christians</NORP> was a grateful sacrifice to the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> prophet.
 Yet the arms of <PERSON>Togrul</PERSON> did not make any deep or lasting impression on the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire.
 The torrent rolled away from the open country; the sultan retired without glory or success from the siege of an <NORP>Armenian</NORP> city; the obscure hostilities were continued or suspended with a vicissitude of events; and the bravery of the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> legions renewed the fame of the conqueror of Asia.
 (26) Reign of Alp Arslan, A.
D.
 1063-1072.
 The name of Alp Arslan, the valiant lion, is expressive of the popular idea of the perfection of man; and the successor of <PERSON>Togrul</PERSON> displayed the fierceness and generosity of the royal animal.
 He passed the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> at the head of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> cavalry, and entered Caesarea, the metropolis of Cappadocia, to which he had been attracted by the fame and wealth of the temple of St.
 Basil.
 The solid structure resisted the destroyer: but he carried away the doors of the shrine encrusted with gold and pearls, and profaned the relics of the tutelar saint, whose mortal frailties were now covered by the venerable rust of antiquity.
 The final conquest of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and Georgia, A.
D.
 1065-1068.
 The final conquest of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and <GPE>Georgia</GPE> was achieved by Alp Arslan.
 In Armenia, the title of a kingdom, and the spirit of a nation, were annihilated: the artificial fortifications were yielded by the mercenaries of Constantinople; by strangers without faith, veterans without pay or arms, and recruits without experience or discipline.
 The loss of this important frontier was the news of a day; and the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> were neither surprised nor displeased, that a people so deeply infected with the <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> and <NORP>Eutychian</NORP> errors had been delivered by <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and his mother into the hands of the infidels.
 (27) The woods and valleys of Mount Caucasus were more strenuously defended by the native <NORP>Georgians</NORP> (28) or Iberians; but the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan and his son <PERSON>Malek</PERSON> were indefatigable in this holy war: their captives were compelled to promise a spiritual, as well as temporal, obedience; and, instead of their collars and bracelets, an iron horseshoe, a badge of ignominy, was imposed on the infidels who still adhered to the worship of their fathers.
 The change, however, was not sincere or universal; and, through ages of servitude, the <NORP>Georgians</NORP> have maintained the succession of their princes and bishops.
 But a race of men, whom nature has cast in her most perfect mould, is degraded by poverty, ignorance, and vice; their profession, and still more their practice, of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> is an empty name; and if they have emerged from heresy, it is only because they are too illiterate to remember a metaphysical creed.
 (29) The emperor <GPE>Romanus</GPE> <PERSON>Diogenes</PERSON> , A.
D.
 1068-1071.
 The false or genuine magnanimity of <PERSON>Mahmud</PERSON> the <PERSON>Gaznevide</PERSON> was not imitated by Alp Arslan; and he attacked without scruple the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empress <PERSON>Eudocia</PERSON> and her children.
 His alarming progress compelled her to give herself and her sceptre to the hand of a soldier; and <GPE>Romanus</GPE> <PERSON>Diogenes</PERSON> was invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple.
 His patriotism, and perhaps his pride, urged him from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> within <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months after his accession; and the next campaign he most scandalously took the field during the holy festival of Easter.
 In the palace, <PERSON>Diogenes</PERSON> was no more than the husband of Eudocia: in the camp, he was the emperor of the Romans, and he sustained that character with feeble resources and invincible courage.
 By his spirit and success the soldiers were taught to act, the subjects to hope, and the enemies to fear.
 The <NORP>Turks</NORP> had penetrated into the heart of Phrygia; but the sultan himself had resigned to his emirs the prosecution of the war; and their numerous detachments were scattered over <LOC>Asia</LOC> in the security of conquest.
 <PERSON>Laden</PERSON> with spoil, and careless of discipline, they were separately surprised and defeated by the Greeks: the activity of the emperor seemed to multiply his presence: and while they heard of his expedition to Antioch, the enemy felt his sword on the hills of Trebizond.
 In <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> laborious campaigns, the <NORP>Turks</NORP> were driven beyond the Euphrates; in the fourth and last, <GPE>Romanus</GPE> undertook the deliverance of Armenia.
 The desolation of the land obliged him to transport a supply of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months' provisions; and he marched forwards to the siege of Malazkerd, (30) an important fortress in the midway between the modern cities of <GPE>Arzeroum</GPE> and Van.
 His army amounted, at the least, to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand men.
 The troops of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> were reinforced by the disorderly multitudes of <GPE>Phrygia</GPE> and Cappadocia; but the real strength was composed of the subjects and allies of Europe, the legions of Macedonia, and the squadrons of Bulgaria; the Uzi, a <NORP>Moldavian</NORP> horde, who were themselves of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> race; (31) and, above all, the mercenary and adventurous bands of <NORP>French</NORP> and Normans.
 Their lances were commanded by the valiant <PERSON>Ursel</PERSON> of Baliol, the kinsman or father of the <NORP>Scottish</NORP> kings, (32) and were allowed to excel in the exercise of arms, or, according to the <NORP>Greek</NORP> style, in the practice of the <NORP>Pyrrhic</NORP> dance.
 Defeat of the Romans, A.
D.
 1071, August.
 On the report of this bold invasion, which threatened his hereditary dominions, Alp Arslan flew to the scene of action at the head of forty thousand horse.
 (33) His rapid and skilful evolutions distressed and dismayed the superior numbers of the Greeks; and in the defeat of Basilacius, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their principal generals, he displayed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> example of his valour and clemency.
 The imprudence of the emperor had separated his forces after the reduction of Malazkerd.
 It was in vain that he attempted to recall the mercenary Franks: they refused to obey his summons; he disdained to await their return: the desertion of the <PERSON>Uzi</PERSON> filled his mind with anxiety and suspicion; and against the most salutary advice he rushed forwards to speedy and decisive action.
 Had he listened to the fair proposals of the sultan, <GPE>Romanus</GPE> might have secured a retreat, perhaps a peace; but in these overtures he supposed the fear or weakness of the enemy, and his answer was conceived in the tone of insult and defiance.
 Alp Arslan smiled at the vanity of the demand, but he wept the death of so many faithful Moslems; and, after a devout prayer, proclaimed a free permission to all who were desirous of retiring from the field.
 With his own hands he tied up his horse's tail, exchanged his bow and arrows for a mace and cimeter, clothed himself in a white garment, perfumed his body with musk, and declared that if he were vanquished, that spot should be the place of his burial.
 (34) The sultan himself had affected to cast away his missile weapons: but his hopes of victory were placed in the arrows of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> cavalry, whose squadrons were loosely distributed in the form of a crescent.
 Instead of the successive lines and reserves of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> tactics, <PERSON>Romulus</PERSON> led his army in a single and solid phalanx, and pressed with vigour and impatience the artful and yielding resistance of the Barbarians.
 In this desultory and fruitless combat he spent the greater part of a summer's day, till prudence and fatigue compelled him to return to his camp.
 But a retreat is always perilous in the face of an active foe; and no sooner had the standard been turned to the rear than the phalanx was broken by the base cowardice, or the baser jealousy, of Andronicus, a rival prince, who disgraced his birth and the purple of the Caesars.
 (35) The <NORP>Turkish</NORP> squadrons poured a cloud of arrows on this moment of confusion and lassitude; and the horns of their formidable crescent were closed in the rear of the Greeks.
 In the destruction of the army and pillage of the camp, it would be needless to mention the number of the slain or captives.
 The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> writers deplore the loss of an inestimable pearl: they forgot to mention, that in this fatal day the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> provinces of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were irretrievably sacrificed.
 Captivity and deliverance of the emperor.
 As long as a hope survived, <GPE>Romanus</GPE> attempted to rally and save the relics of his army.
 When the centre, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> station, was left naked on all sides, and encompassed by the victorious Turks, he still, with desperate courage, maintained the fight till the close of day, at the head of the brave and faithful subjects who adhered to his standard.
 They fell around him; his horse was slain; the emperor was wounded; yet he stood alone and intrepid, till he was oppressed and bound by the strength of multitudes.
 The glory of this illustrious prize was disputed by a slave and a soldier; a slave who had seen him on the throne of Constantinople, and a soldier whose extreme deformity had been excused on the promise of some signal service.
 Despoiled of his arms, his jewels, and his purple, <GPE>Romanus</GPE> spent a dreary and perilous <TIME>night</TIME> on the field of battle, amidst a disorderly crowd of the meaner Barbarians.
 In the morning the royal captive was presented to Alp Arslan, who doubted of his fortune, till the identity of the person was ascertained by the report of his ambassadors, and by the more pathetic evidence of Basilacius, who embraced with tears the feet of his unhappy sovereign.
 The successor of Constantine, in a plebeian habit, was led into the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> divan, and commanded to kiss the ground before the lord of Asia.
 He reluctantly obeyed; and Alp Arslan, starting from his throne, is said to have planted his foot on the neck of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 (36) But the fact is doubtful; and if, in this moment of insolence, the sultan complied with the national custom, the rest of his conduct has extorted the praise of his bigoted foes, and may afford a lesson to the most civilized ages.
 He instantly raised the royal captive from the ground; and thrice clasping his hand with tender sympathy, assured him, that his life and dignity should be inviolate in the hands of a prince who had learned to respect the majesty of his equals and the vicissitudes of fortune.
 From the divan, <GPE>Romanus</GPE> was conducted to an adjacent tent, where he was served with pomp and reverence by the officers of the sultan, who, twice each day, seated him in the place of honour at his own table.
 In a free and familiar conversation of eight days, not a word, not a look, of insult escaped from the conqueror; but he severely censured the unworthy subjects who had deserted their valiant prince in the hour of danger, and gently admonished his antagonist of some errors which he had committed in the management of the war.
 In the preliminaries of negotiation, Alp Arslan asked him what treatment he expected to receive, and the calm indifference of the emperor displays the freedom of his mind.
 The reply of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> betrays a sentiment, which prudence, and even gratitude, should have taught him to suppress.
 The <NORP>Turkish</NORP> conqueror smiled at the insolence of his captive observed that the <NORP>Christian</NORP> law inculcated the love of enemies and forgiveness of injuries; and nobly declared, that he would not imitate an example which he condemned.
 After mature deliberation, Alp Arslan dictated the terms of liberty and peace, a ransom of a million, an annual tribute of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty thousand pieces of gold, (37) the marriage of the royal children, and the deliverance of all the Moslems, who were in the power of the Greeks.
 Romanus, with a sigh, subscribed this treaty, so disgraceful to the majesty of the empire; he was immediately invested with a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> robe of honour; his nobles and patricians were restored to their sovereign; and the sultan, after a courteous embrace, dismissed him with rich presents and a military guard.
 No sooner did he reach the confines of the empire, than he was informed that the palace and provinces had disclaimed their allegiance to a captive: a sum of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand pieces was painfully collected; and the fallen monarch transmitted this part of his ransom, with a sad confession of his impotence and disgrace.
 The generosity, or perhaps the ambition, of the sultan, prepared to espouse the cause of his ally; but his designs were prevented by the defeat, imprisonment, and death, of <GPE>Romanus</GPE> Diogenes.
 (38) Death of Alp Arslan, A.
D.
 1072.
 In the treaty of peace, it does not appear that Alp Arslan extorted any province or city from the captive emperor; and his revenge was satisfied with the trophies of his victory, and the spoils of Anatolia, from <GPE>Antioch</GPE> to the Black Sea.
 The fairest part of <LOC>Asia</LOC> was subject to his laws: <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> princes, or the sons of princes, stood before his throne; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand soldiers marched under his banners.
 The sultan disdained to pursue the fugitive Greeks; but he meditated the more glorious conquest of Turkestan, the original seat of the house of Seljuk.
 He moved from <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> to the banks of the Oxus; a bridge was thrown over the river; and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <DATE>days</DATE> were consumed in the passage of his troops.
 But the progress of the great king was retarded by the governor of Berzem; and <PERSON>Joseph</PERSON> the <NORP>Carizmian</NORP> presumed to defend his fortress against the powers of the East.
 When he was produced a captive in the royal tent, the sultan, instead of praising his valour, severely reproached his obstinate folly: and the insolent replies of the rebel provoked a sentence, that he should be fastened to <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> stakes, and left to expire in that painful situation.
 At this command, the desperate Carizmian, drawing a dagger, rushed headlong towards the throne: the guards raised their battle-axes; their zeal was checked by Alp Arslan, the most skilful archer of the age: he drew his bow, but his foot slipped, the arrow glanced aside, and he received in his breast the dagger of Joseph, who was instantly cut in pieces.
 The wound was mortal; and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> prince bequeathed a dying admonition to the pride of kings.
 Alp Arslan possessed the virtues of a <NORP>Turk</NORP> and a Mussulman; his voice and stature commanded the reverence of mankind; his face was shaded with long whiskers; and his ample turban was fashioned in the shape of a crown.
 The remains of the sultan were deposited in the tomb of the <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> dynasty; and the passenger might read and meditate this useful inscription: (40) The annihilation of the inscription, and the tomb itself, more forcibly proclaims the instability of human greatness.
 Reign and prosperity of <PERSON>Malek</PERSON> Shah, A.
D.
 1072-1092.
 During the life of Alp Arslan, his eldest son had been acknowledged as the future sultan of the Turks.
 On his father's death the inheritance was disputed by an uncle, a cousin, and a brother: they drew their cimeters, and assembled their followers; and the triple victory of <PERSON>Malek</PERSON> Shah (41) established his own reputation and the right of primogeniture.
 In every age, and more especially in Asia, the thirst of power has inspired the same passions, and occasioned the same disorders; but, from the long series of civil war, it would not be easy to extract a sentiment more pure and magnanimous than is contained in the saying of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> prince.
 On the eve of the battle, he performed his devotions at Thous, before the tomb of the Imam Riza.
 As the sultan rose from the ground, he asked his vizier Nizam, who had knelt beside him, what had been the object of his secret petition: "That your arms may be crowned with victory," was the prudent, and most probably the sincere, answer of the minister.
 The favourable judgment of heaven was ratified by the caliph; and for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time, the sacred title of Commander of the Faithful was communicated to a Barbarian.
 But this Barbarian, by his personal merit, and the extent of his empire, was the greatest prince of his age.
 After the settlement of <GPE>Persia</GPE> and Syria, he marched at the head of innumerable armies to achieve the conquest of Turkestan, which had been undertaken by his father.
 In his passage of the Oxus, the boatmen, who had been employed in transporting some troops, complained, that their payment was assigned on the revenues of Antioch.
 The sultan frowned at this preposterous choice; but he smiled at the artful flattery of his vizier.
 But this description of his limits was unjust and parsimonious: beyond the Oxus, he reduced to his obedience the cities of Bochara, Carizme, and Samarcand, and crushed each rebellious slave, or independent savage, who dared to resist.
 <PERSON>Malek</PERSON> passed the <NORP>Sihon</NORP> or Jaxartes, the last boundary of <NORP>Persian</NORP> civilization: the hordes of <NORP>Turkestan</NORP> yielded to his supremacy: his name was inserted on the coins, and in the prayers of Cashgar, a <NORP>Tartar</NORP> kingdom on the extreme borders of China.
 From the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> frontier, he stretched his immediate jurisdiction or feudatory sway to the west and south, as far as the mountains of Georgia, the neighbourhood of Constantinople, the holy city of Jerusalem, and the spicy groves of Arabia Felix.
 Instead of resigning himself to the luxury of his harem, the shepherd king, both in peace and war, was in action and in the field.
 By the perpetual motion of the royal camp, each province was successively blessed with his presence; and he is said to have perambulated <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> times the wide extent of his dominions, which surpassed the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> reign of <PERSON>Cyrus</PERSON> and the caliphs.
 Of these expeditions, the most pious and splendid was the pilgrimage of Mecca: the freedom and safety of the caravans were protected by his arms; the citizens and pilgrims were enriched by the profusion of his alms; and the desert was cheered by the places of relief and refreshment, which he instituted for the use of his brethren.
 Hunting was the pleasure, and even the passion, of the sultan, and his train consisted of forty-seven thousand horses; but after the massacre of a <NORP>Turkish</NORP> chase, for each piece of game, he bestowed a piece of gold on the poor, a slight atonement, at the expense of the people, for the cost and mischief of the amusement of kings.
 In the peaceful prosperity of his reign, the cities of <LOC>Asia</LOC> were adorned with palaces and hospitals with moschs and colleges; few departed from his <NORP>Divan</NORP> without reward, and none without justice.
 The language and literature of <GPE>Persia</GPE> revived under the house of Seljuk; (42) and if <PERSON>Malek</PERSON> emulated the liberality of a <NORP>Turk</NORP> less potent than himself, (43) his palace might resound with the songs of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> poets.
 The sultan bestowed a more serious and learned care on the reformation of the calendar, which was effected by a general assembly of the astronomers of the East.
 By a law of the prophet, the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> are confined to the irregular course of the lunar months; in Persia, since the age of Zoroaster, the revolution of the sun has been known and celebrated as an annual festival; (44) but after the fall of the <NORP>Magian</NORP> empire, the intercalation had been neglected; the fractions of minutes and hours were multiplied into days; and the date of the springs was removed from the sign of Aries to that of Pisces.
 The reign of <PERSON>Malek</PERSON> was illustrated by the <NORP>Gelalaean</NORP> era; and all errors, either past or future, were corrected by a computation of time, which surpasses the Julian, and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian, style.
 (45) His death, A.
D.
 1092.
 In a period when <LOC>Europe</LOC> was plunged in the deepest barbarism, the light and splendour of <LOC>Asia</LOC> may be ascribed to the docility rather than the knowledge of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> conquerors.
 An ample share of their wisdom and virtue is due to a <NORP>Persian</NORP> vizier, who ruled the empire under the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son.
 Nizam, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most illustrious ministers of the East, was honoured by the caliph as an oracle of religion and science; he was trusted by the sultan as the faithful vicegerent of his power and justice.
 After an administration of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, the fame of the vizier, his wealth, and even his services, were transformed into crimes.
 He was overthrown by the insidious arts of a woman and a rival; and his fall was hastened by a rash declaration, that his cap and ink-horn, the badges of his office, were connected by the divine decree with the throne and diadem of the sultan.
 At the age of ninety-three years, the venerable statesman was dismissed by his master, accused by his enemies, and murdered by a fanatic: the last words of <PERSON>Nizam</PERSON> attested his innocence, and the remainder of Malek's life was short and inglorious.
 From Ispahan, the scene of this disgraceful transaction, the sultan moved to Bagdad, with the design of transplanting the caliph, and of fixing his own residence in the capital of the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> world.
 The feeble successor of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> obtained a respite of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days; and before the expiration of the term, the <PERSON>Barbarian</PERSON> was summoned by the angel of death.
 His ambassadors at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had asked in marriage a <NORP>Roman</NORP> princess; but the proposal was decently eluded; and the daughter of Alexius, who might herself have been the victim, expresses her abhorrence of his unnatural conjunction.
 (46) The daughter of the sultan was bestowed on the caliph Moctadi, with the imperious condition, that, renouncing the society of his wives and concubines, he should forever confine himself to this honourable alliance.
 Division of the <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> empire.
 The greatness and unity of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> empire expired in the person of <PERSON>Malek</PERSON> Shah.
 His vacant throne was disputed by his brother and his <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> sons; and, after a series of civil wars, the treaty which reconciled the surviving candidates confirmed a lasting separation in the <NORP>Persian</NORP> dynasty, the eldest and principal branch of the house of Seljuk.
 The <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> younger dynasties were those of Kerman, of Syria, and of Roum: the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these commanded an extensive, though obscure, (47) dominion on the shores of the <NORP>Indian</NORP> Ocean: (48) the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> expelled the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> princes of <GPE>Aleppo</GPE> and Damascus; and the third, our peculiar care, invaded the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor.
 The generous policy of <PERSON>Malek</PERSON> contributed to their elevation: he allowed the princes of his blood, even those whom he had vanquished in the field, to seek new kingdoms worthy of their ambition; nor was he displeased that they should draw away the more ardent spirits, who might have disturbed the tranquillity of his reign.
 As the supreme head of his family and nation, the great sultan of <GPE>Persia</GPE> commanded the obedience and tribute of his royal brethren: the thrones of <NORP>Kerman</NORP> and Nice, of <GPE>Aleppo</GPE> and Damascus; the Atabeks, and emirs of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Mesopotamia, erected their standards under the shadow of his sceptre: (49) and the hordes of <NORP>Turkmans</NORP> overspread the plains of the Western Asia.
 After the death of Malek, the bands of union and subordination were relaxed and finally dissolved: the indulgence of the house of <PERSON>Seljuk</PERSON> invested their slaves with the inheritance of kingdoms; and, in the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> style, a crowd of princes arose from the dust of their feet.
 (50) Conquest of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor by the Turks, A.
D.
 1074-1084.
 A prince of the royal line, Cutulmish, the son of Izrail, the son of Seljuk, had fallen in a battle against Alp Arslan and the humane victor had dropped a tear over his grave.
 His <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> sons, strong in arms, ambitious of power, and eager for revenge, unsheathed their cimeters against the son of Alp Arslan.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies expected the signal when the caliph, forgetful of the majesty which secluded him from vulgar eyes, interposed his venerable mediation.
 They listened to his voice; the sultan embraced his rebellious kinsmen; and the eldest, the valiant Soliman, accepted the royal standard, which gave him the free conquest and hereditary command of the provinces of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, from <GPE>Arzeroum</GPE> to Constantinople, and the unknown regions of the West.
 (51) Accompanied by his <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> brothers, he passed the Euphrates; the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> camp was soon seated in the neighbourhood of <GPE>Kutaieh</GPE> in Phrygia; and his flying cavalry laid waste the country as far as the <LOC>Hellespont</LOC> and the Black Sea.
 Since the decline of the empire, the peninsula of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor had been exposed to the transient, though destructive, inroads of the <NORP>Persians</NORP> and Saracens; but the fruits of a lasting conquest were reserved for the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> sultan; and his arms were introduced by the Greeks, who aspired to reign on the ruins of their country.
 Since the captivity of Romanus, six years the feeble son of <PERSON>Eudocia</PERSON> had trembled under the weight of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown, till the provinces of the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> were lost in the same month by a double rebellion: of either chief <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> was the common name; but the surnames of <PERSON>Bryennius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Botoniates</PERSON> distinguish the <NORP>European</NORP> and <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> candidates.
 Their reasons, or rather their promises, were weighed in the Divan; and, after some hesitation, <GPE>Soliman</GPE> declared himself in favour of Botoniates, opened a free passage to his troops in their march from <GPE>Antioch</GPE> to Nice, and joined the banner of the <FAC>Crescent</FAC> to that of the Cross.
 After his ally had ascended the throne of Constantinople, the sultan was hospitably entertained in the suburb of <GPE>Chrysopolis</GPE> or Scutari; and a body of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <NORP>Turks</NORP> was transported into Europe, to whose dexterity and courage the new emperor was indebted for the defeat and captivity of his rival, Bryennius.
 But the conquest of <LOC>Europe</LOC> was dearly purchased by the sacrifice of Asia: <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was deprived of the obedience and revenue of the provinces beyond the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> and Hellespont; and the regular progress of the Turks, who fortified the passes of the rivers and mountains, left not a hope of their retreat or expulsion.
 Another candidate implored the aid of the sultan: Melissenus, in his purple robes and red buskins, attended the motions of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> camp; and the desponding cities were tempted by the summons of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> prince, who immediately surrendered them into the hands of the Barbarians.
 These acquisitions were confirmed by a treaty of peace with the emperor Alexius: his fear of <PERSON>Robert</PERSON> compelled him to seek the friendship of Soliman; and it was not till after the sultan's death that he extended as far as Nicomedia, about sixty miles from Constantinople, the eastern boundary of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 <GPE>Trebizond</GPE> alone, defended on either side by the sea and mountains, preserved at the extremity of the <NORP>Euxine</NORP> the ancient character of a <NORP>Greek</NORP> colony, and the future destiny of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> empire.
 The <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> kingdom of Roum.
 Since the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conquests of the caliphs, the establishment of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> in <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> or <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor was the most deplorable loss which the church and empire had sustained.
 By the propagation of the <NORP>Moslem</NORP> faith, <GPE>Soliman</GPE> deserved the name of Gazi, a holy champion; and his new kingdoms, of the Romans, or of Roum, was added to the tables of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> geography.
 It is described as extending from the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> to Constantinople, from the Black Sea to the confines of Syria; pregnant with mines of silver and iron, of alum and copper, fruitful in corn and wine, and productive of cattle and excellent horses.
 (52) The wealth of Lydia, the arts of the Greeks, the splendour of the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> age, existed only in books and ruins, which were equally obscure in the eyes of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> conquerors.
 Yet, in the present decay, <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> still contains some wealthy and populous cities; and, under the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire, they were far more flourishing in numbers, size, and opulence.
 By the choice of the sultan, Nice, the metropolis of Bithynia, was preferred for his palace and fortress: the seat of the <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> dynasty of <GPE>Roum</GPE> was planted <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles from Constantinople; and the divinity of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> was denied and derided in the same temple in which it had been pronounced by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> general synod of the Catholics.
 The unity of God, and the mission of Mahomet, were preached in the moschs; the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> learning was taught in the schools; the <NORP>Cadhis</NORP> judged according to the law of the Koran; the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> manners and language prevailed in the cities; and <NORP>Turkman</NORP> camps were scattered over the plains and mountains of Anatolia.
 On the hard conditions of tribute and servitude, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> <NORP>Christians</NORP> might enjoy the exercise of their religion; but their most holy churches were profaned; their priests and bishops were insulted; (53) they were compelled to suffer the triumph of the Pagans, and the apostasy of their brethren; many thousand children were marked by the knife of circumcision; and many thousand captives were devoted to the service or the pleasures of their masters.
 (54) After the loss of Asia, <GPE>Antioch</GPE> still maintained her primitive allegiance to <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and Caesar; but the solitary province was separated from all <NORP>Roman</NORP> aid, and surrounded on all sides by the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> powers.
 The despair of <GPE>Philaretus</GPE> the governor prepared the sacrifice of his religion and loyalty, had not his guilt been prevented by his son, who hastened to the <PERSON>Nicene</PERSON> palace, and offered to deliver this valuable prize into the hands of Soliman.
 The ambitious sultan mounted on horseback, and in <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> nights (for he reposed in the day) performed a march of six <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles.
 <GPE>Antioch</GPE> was oppressed by the speed and secrecy of his enterprise; and the dependent cities, as far as <GPE>Laodicea</GPE> and the confines of Aleppo, (55) obeyed the example of the metropolis.
 From <GPE>Laodicea</GPE> to the Thracian Bosphorus, or arm of St.
 George, the conquests and reign of <GPE>Soliman</GPE> extended <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> days' journey in length, and in breadth about <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> or fifteen, between the rocks of <LOC>Lycia</LOC> and the Black Sea.
 (56) The <NORP>Turkish</NORP> ignorance of navigation protected, for a while, the inglorious safety of the emperor; but no sooner had a fleet of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> ships been constructed by the hands of the captive Greeks, than <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> trembled behind the walls of his capital.
 His plaintive epistles were dispersed over Europe, to excite the compassion of the Latins, and to paint the danger, the weakness, and the riches of the city of Constantine.
 (57) State and pilgrimage of Jerusalem, A.
D.
 638-1099.
 But the most interesting conquest of the <NORP>Seljukian</NORP> <NORP>Turks</NORP> was that of Jerusalem, (58) which soon became the theatre of nations.
 In their capitulation with Omar, the inhabitants had stipulated the assurance of their religion and property; but the articles were interpreted by a master against whom it was dangerous to dispute; and in the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years of the reign of the caliphs, the political climate of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> was exposed to the vicissitudes of storm and sunshine.
 (59) By the increase of proselytes and population, the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> might excuse the usurpation of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> fourths of the city: but a peculiar quarter was resolved for the patriarch with his clergy and people; a tribute of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> pieces of gold was the price of protection; and the sepulchre of Christ, with the church of the Resurrection, was still left in the hands of his votaries.
 Of these votaries, the most numerous and respectable portion were strangers to Jerusalem: the pilgrimages to the Holy Land had been stimulated, rather than suppressed, by the conquest of the Arabs; and the enthusiasm which had always prompted these perilous journeys, was nourished by the congenial passions of grief and indignation.
 A crowd of pilgrims from the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> continued to visit the holy sepulchre, and the adjacent sanctuaries, more especially at the festival of Easter; and the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, the <NORP>Nestorians</NORP> and Jacobites, the <NORP>Copts</NORP> and Abyssinians, the <NORP>Armenians</NORP> and Georgians, maintained the chapels, the clergy, and the poor of their respective communions.
 The harmony of prayer in so many various tongues, the worship of so many nations in the common temple of their religion, might have afforded a spectacle of edification and peace; but the zeal of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> sects was embittered by hatred and revenge; and in the kingdom of a suffering Messiah, who had pardoned his enemies, they aspired to command and persecute their spiritual brethren.
 The preeminence was asserted by the spirit and numbers of the Franks; and the greatness of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> (60) protected both the <NORP>Latin</NORP> pilgrims and the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> of the East.
 The poverty of Carthage, Alexandria, and Jerusalem, was relieved by the alms of that pious emperor; and many monasteries of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> were founded or restored by his liberal devotion.
 Harun Alrashid, the greatest of the Abbassides, esteemed in his <NORP>Christian</NORP> brother a similar supremacy of genius and power: their friendship was cemented by a frequent intercourse of gifts and embassies; and the caliph, without resigning the substantial dominion, presented the emperor with the keys of the holy sepulchre, and perhaps of the city of Jerusalem.
 In the decline of the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> monarchy, the republic of <GPE>Amalphi</GPE> promoted the interest of trade and religion in the East.
 Her vessels transported the <NORP>Latin</NORP> pilgrims to the coasts of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Palestine, and deserved, by their useful imports, the favour and alliance of the <PERSON>Fatimite</PERSON> caliphs: (61) an annual fair was instituted on Mount Calvary: and the <NORP>Italian</NORP> merchants founded the convent and hospital of St.
 John of Jerusalem, the cradle of the monastic and military order, which has since reigned in the isles of <PERSON>Rhodes</PERSON> and of Malta.
 Had the <NORP>Christian</NORP> pilgrims been content to revere the tomb of a prophet, the disciples of Mahomet, instead of blaming, would have imitated, their piety: but these rigid <NORP>Unitarians</NORP> were scandalized by a worship which represents the birth, death, and resurrection, of a God; the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> images were branded with the name of idols; and the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> smiled with indignation (62) at the miraculous flame which was kindled on the eve of <DATE>Easter</DATE> in the holy sepulchre.
 (63) This pious fraud, <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> devised in the ninth century, (64) was devoutly cherished by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> crusaders, and is annually repeated by the clergy of the Greek, Armenian, and <NORP>Coptic</NORP> sects, (65) who impose on the credulous spectators (66) for their own benefit, and that of their tyrants.
 In every age, a principle of toleration has been fortified by a sense of interest: and the revenue of the prince and his emir was increased each year, by the expense and tribute of so many thousand strangers.
 Under the <PERSON>Fatimite</PERSON> caliphs, A.
D.
 969-1076.
 The revolution which transferred the sceptre from the <NORP>Abbassides</NORP> to the <PRODUCT>Fatimites</PRODUCT> was a benefit, rather than an injury, to the Holy Land.
 A sovereign resident in <GPE>Egypt</GPE> was more sensible of the importance of <NORP>Christian</NORP> trade; and the emirs of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> were less remote from the justice and power of the throne.
 But the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of these <PERSON>Fatimite</PERSON> caliphs was the famous Hakem, (67) a frantic youth, who was delivered by his impiety and despotism from the fear either of God or man; and whose reign was a wild mixture of vice and folly.
 Regardless of the most ancient customs of Egypt, he imposed on the women an absolute confinement; the restraint excited the clamours of both sexes; their clamours provoked his fury; a part of Old <GPE>Cairo</GPE> was delivered to the flames and the guards and citizens were engaged many <DATE>days</DATE> in a bloody conflict.
 At <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> the caliph declared himself a zealous Mussulman, the founder or benefactor of moschs and colleges: <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and ninety copies of the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> were transcribed at his expense in letters of gold; and his edict extirpated the vineyards of the Upper Egypt.
 But his vanity was soon flattered by the hope of introducing a new religion; he aspired above the fame of a prophet, and styled himself the visible image of the Most High God, who, after <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> apparitions on earth, was at length manifest in his royal person.
 At the name of Hakem, the lord of the living and the dead, every knee was bent in religious adoration: his mysteries were performed on a mountain near Cairo: sixteen thousand converts had signed his profession of faith; and at the present hour, a free and warlike people, the <NORP>Druses</NORP> of Mount Libanus, are persuaded of the life and divinity of a madman and tyrant.
 (68) In his divine character, <NORP>Hakem</NORP> hated the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and Christians, as the servants of his rivals; while some remains of prejudice or prudence still pleaded in favour of the law of Mahomet.
 Both in <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Palestine, his cruel and wanton persecution made some martyrs and many apostles: the common rights and special privileges of the sectaries were equally disregarded; and a general interdict was laid on the devotion of strangers and natives.
 Sacrilege of Hakem, A.
D.
 1009.
 The temple of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world, the church of the Resurrection, was demolished to its foundations; the luminous prodigy of <DATE>Easter</DATE> was interrupted, and much profane labor was exhausted to destroy the cave in the rock which properly constitutes the holy sepulchre.
 At the report of this sacrilege, the nations of <LOC>Europe</LOC> were astonished and afflicted: but instead of arming in the defence of the Holy Land, they contented themselves with burning, or banishing, the Jews, as the secret advisers of the impious Barbarian.
 (69) Yet the calamities of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> were in some measure alleviated by the inconstancy or repentance of <NORP>Hakem</NORP> himself; and the royal mandate was sealed for the restitution of the churches, when the tyrant was assassinated by the emissaries of his sister.
 The succeeding caliphs resumed the maxims of religion and policy: a free toleration was again granted; with the pious aid of the emperor of Constantinople, the holy sepulchre arose from its ruins; and, after a short abstinence, the pilgrims returned with an increase of appetite to the spiritual feast.
 (70) In the sea-voyage of Palestine, the dangers were frequent, and the opportunities rare: but the conversion of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> opened a safe communication between <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Greece.
 The charity of St.
 Stephen, the apostle of his kingdom, relieved and conducted his itinerant brethren; (71) and from <GPE>Belgrade</GPE> to Antioch, they traversed <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> empire.
 Increase of pilgrimages, A.
D.
 1024, etc.
 Among the Franks, the zeal of pilgrimage prevailed beyond the example of former times: and the roads were covered with multitudes of either sex, and of every rank, who professed their contempt of life, so soon as they should have kissed the tomb of their Redeemer.
 Princes and prelates abandoned the care of their dominions; and the numbers of these pious caravans were a prelude to the armies which marched in the ensuing age under the banner of the cross.
 About <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years before the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade, the arch bishop of Mentz, with the bishops of Utrecht, Bamberg, and Ratisbon, undertook this laborious journey from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Jordan; and the multitude of their followers amounted to <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand persons.
 At Constantinople, they were hospitably entertained by the emperor; but the ostentation of their wealth provoked the assault of the wild Arabs: they drew their swords with scrupulous reluctance, and sustained siege in the village of Capernaum, till they were rescued by the venal protection of the <PERSON>Fatimite</PERSON> emir.
 After visiting the holy places, they embarked for Italy, but only a remnant of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand arrived in safety in their native land.
 Ingulphus, a secretary of William the Conqueror, was a companion of this pilgrimage: he observes that they sailed from Normandy, <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> stout and well-appointed horsemen; but that they repassed the Alps, <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> miserable palmers, with the staff in their hand, and the wallet at their back.
 (72) Conquest of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> by the Turks, A.
D.
 1076-1096.
 After the defeat of the Romans, the tranquillity of the <PERSON>Fatimite</PERSON> caliphs was invaded by the Turks.
 (73) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the lieutenants of <PERSON>Malek</PERSON> Shah, <PERSON>Atsiz</PERSON> the Carizmian, marched into <GPE>Syria</GPE> at the head of a powerful army, and reduced <GPE>Damascus</GPE> by famine and the sword.
 Hems, and the other cities of the province, acknowledged the caliph of <GPE>Bagdad</GPE> and the sultan of Persia; and the victorious emir advanced without resistance to the banks of the Nile: the <PERSON>Fatimite</PERSON> was preparing to fly into the heart of Africa; but the negroes of his guard and the inhabitants of <GPE>Cairo</GPE> made a desperate sally, and repulsed the <NORP>Turk</NORP> from the confines of Egypt.
 In his retreat he indulged the license of slaughter and rapine: the judge and notaries of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> were invited to his camp; and their execution was followed by the massacre of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand citizens.
 The cruelty or the defeat of <PERSON>Atsiz</PERSON> was soon punished by the sultan Toucush, the brother of <PERSON>Malek</PERSON> Shah, who, with a higher title and more formidable powers, asserted the dominion of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Palestine.
 The house of <PERSON>Seljuk</PERSON> reigned about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years in Jerusalem; (74) but the hereditary command of the holy city and territory was entrusted or abandoned to the emir Ortok, the chief of a tribe of Turkmans, whose children, after their expulsion from Palestine, formed <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> dynasties on the borders of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and Assyria.
 (75) The <NORP>Oriental</NORP> <NORP>Christians</NORP> and the <NORP>Latin</NORP> pilgrims deplored a revolution, which, instead of the regular government and old alliance of the caliphs, imposed on their necks the iron yoke of the strangers of the North.
 (76) In his court and camp the great sultan had adopted in some degree the arts and manners of Persia; but the body of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> nation, and more especially the pastoral tribes, still breathed the fierceness of the desert.
 From <GPE>Nice</GPE> to Jerusalem, the western countries of <LOC>Asia</LOC> were a scene of foreign and domestic hostility; and the shepherds of Palestine, who held a precarious sway on a doubtful frontier, had neither leisure nor capacity to await the slow profits of commercial and religious freedom.
 The pilgrims, who, through innumerable perils, had reached the gates of Jerusalem, were the victims of private rapine or public oppression, and often sunk under the pressure of famine and disease, before they were permitted to salute the holy sepulchre.
 A spirit of native barbarism, or recent zeal, prompted the <NORP>Turkmans</NORP> to insult the clergy of every sect: the patriarch was dragged by the hair along the pavement, and cast into a dungeon, to extort a ransom from the sympathy of his flock; and the divine worship in the church of the <FAC>Resurrection</FAC> was often disturbed by the savage rudeness of its masters.
 The pathetic tale excited the <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of the <LOC>West</LOC> to march under the standard of the cross to the relief of the Holy Land; and yet how trifling is the sum of these accumulated evils, if compared with the single act of the sacrilege of Hakem, which had been so patiently endured by the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Christians! A slighter provocation inflamed the more irascible temper of their descendants: a new spirit had arisen of religious chivalry and papal dominion; a nerve was touched of exquisite feeling; and the sensation vibrated to the heart of Europe.
