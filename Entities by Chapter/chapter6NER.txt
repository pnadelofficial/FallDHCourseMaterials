The death of Severus.
 Tyranny of Caracalla.
 Usurpation of Macrinus.
 Follies of Elagabalus.
 Virtues of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> Severus.
 Licentiousness of the Army.
 General <ORG>State</ORG> of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> financesGreatness and discontent of <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> THE ascent to greatness, however steep and dangerous, may entertain an active spirit with the consciousness and exercise of its own powers; but the possession of a throne could never yet afford a lasting satisfaction to an ambitious mind.
 This melancholy truth was felt and acknowledged by Severus.
 Fortune and merit had, from an humble station, elevated him to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> place among mankind.
 Distracted with the care, not of acquiring, but of preserving an empire, oppressed with age and infirmities, careless of fame, (2) and satiated with power, all his prospects of life were closed.
 The desire of perpetuating the greatness of his family was the only remaining wish of his ambition and paternal tenderness.
 His wife the empress <PERSON>Julia</PERSON> Like most of the Africans, <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> was passionately addicted to the vain studies of magic and divination, deeply versed in the interpretation of dreams and omens, and perfectly acquainted with the science of judicial astrology; which, in almost every age, except the present, has maintained its dominion over the mind of man.
 He had lost his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife whilst he was governor of the Lyonnese Gaul.
(3) In the choice of a second, he sought only to connect himself with some favourite of fortune; and as soon as he had discovered that a young lady of <PERSON>Emesa</PERSON> in <GPE>Syria</GPE> had a royal nativity he solicited, and obtained her hand.
(4) <PERSON>Julia</PERSON> Domna (for that was her name) deserved all that the stars could promise her.
 She possessed, even in an advanced age, the attractions of beauty,(5) and united to a lively imagination a firmness of mind, and strength of judgment, seldom bestowed on her sex.
 Her amiable qualities never made any deep impression on the dark and jealous temper of her husband, but in her son's reign she administered the principal affairs of the empire, with a prudence that supported his authority; and with a moderation that sometimes corrected his wild extravagances.
 (6) <PERSON>Julia</PERSON> applied herself to letters and philosophy, with some success, and with the most splendid reputation.
 She was the patroness of every art, and the friend of every man of genius.
 (7) The grateful flattery of the learned has celebrated her virtue; but, if we may credit the scandal of ancient history, chastity was very far from being the most conspicuous virtue of the empress Julia.
(8) <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> sons, <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> (9) and Geta, were the fruit of this marriage, and the destined heirs of the empire.
 The fond hopes of the father, and of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, were soon disappointed by these vain youths, who displayed the indolent security of hereditary princes; and a presumption that fortune would supply the place of merit and application.
 Without any emulation of virtue or talents, they discovered, almost from their infancy, a fixed and implacable antipathy for each other.
 Their aversion, confirmed by years, and fomented by the arts of their interested favourites, broke out in childish, and gradually in more serious, competitions; and, at length, divided the theatre, the circus, and the court, into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions; actuated by the hopes and fears of their respective leaders.
 The prudent emperor endeavoured, by every expedient of advice and authority, to allay this growing animosity.
 The unhappy discord of his sons clouded all his prospects, and threatened to overturn a throne raised with so much labour, cemented with so much blood, and guarded with every defence of arms and treasure.
 With an impartial hand he maintained between them an exact balance of favour, conferred on both the rank of Augustus, with the revered name of Antoninus; and for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world beheld <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> emperors.
 (10) Yet even this equal conduct served only to inflame the contest, whilst the fierce <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> asserted the right of primogeniture, and the milder <PERSON>Geta</PERSON> courted the affections of the people and the of soldiers.
 In the anguish of a disappointed father, <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> foretold that the weaker of his sons would fall a sacrifice to the stronger; who, in his turn, would be ruined by his own vices.
(11) The Caledonian war.
 In these circumstances the intelligence of a war in <GPE>Britain</GPE> and of an invasion (A.
D.
 208) of the province by the barbarians of the North, was received with pleasure by Severus.
 Though the vigilance of his lieutenants might have been sufficient to repel the distant enemy, he resolved to embrace the honourable pretext of withdrawing his sons from the luxury of Rome, which enervated their minds and irritated their passions; and of inuring their youth to the toils of war and government.
 Notwithstanding his advanced age (for he was above threescore), and his gout, which obliged him to be carried in a litter, he transported himself in person into that remote island, attended by his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, his whole court, and a formidable army.
 He immediately passed the walls of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> and Antoninus, and entered the enemy's country, with a design of completing the long attempted conquest of Britain.
 He penetrated to the northern extremity of the island without meeting an enemy.
 But the concealed ambuscades of the Caledonians, who hung unseen on the rear and flanks of his army, the coldness of the climate, and the severity of a <DATE>winter</DATE> march across the hills and morasses of Scotland, are reported to have cost the <NORP>Romans</NORP> above fifty thousand men.
 The <NORP>Caledonians</NORP> at length yielded to the powerful and obstinate attack, sued for peace, and surrendered a part of their arms, and a large tract of territory.
 But their apparent submission lasted no longer than the present terror.
 As soon as the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions had retired, they resumed their hostile independence.
 Their restless spirit provoked <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> to send a new army into Caledonia, with the most bloody orders, not to subdue but to extirpate the natives.
 They were saved by the death of their haughty enemy.
(12) <PERSON>Fingal</PERSON> and his heroes This Caledonian war, neither marked by decisive events, nor attended with any important consequences, would ill deserve our attention but it is supposed, not without a considerable degree of probability, that the invasion of <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> is connected with the most shining period of the <NORP>British</NORP> history or fable.
 Fingal, whose fame, with that of his heroes and bards, has been revived in our language by a recent publication, is said to have commanded the <NORP>Caledonians</NORP> in that memorable juncture, to have eluded the power of Severus, and to have obtained a signal victory on the banks of the Carun, in which the son of the King of the World, Caracul, fled from his arms along the fields of his pride.
(13) Something of a doubtful mist still hangs over these <NORP>Highland</NORP> traditions; nor can it be entirely dispelled by the most ingenious researches of modern criticism:(14) but if we could, with safety, indulge the pleasing supposition, that <PERSON>Fingal</PERSON> lived, and that <PERSON>Ossian</PERSON> sung, the striking contrast of the situation and manners of the contending nations might amuse a philosophic mind.
 The parallel would be little to the advantage of the more civilised people, if we compared the unrelenting revenge of <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> with the generous clemency of Fingal, the timid and brutal cruelty of Caracalla, with the bravery, the tenderness, the elegant genius of Ossian; the mercenary chiefs who, from motives of fear or interest, served under the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> standard, with the freeborn warriors who started to arms at the voice of the king of Morven; if, in a word, we contemplated the untutored Caledonians, glowing with the warm virtues of nature, and the degenerate Romans, polluted with the mean vices of wealth and slavery.
 Ambition of <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> The declining health and last illness of <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> inflamed the wild ambition and black passions of Caracalla's soul.
 Impatient of any delay or division of empire, he attempted, more than once, to shorten the small remainder of his father's days, and endeavoured, but without success, to excite a mutiny among the troops.
 (15) The old emperor had often censured the misguided lenity of Marcus, who, by a single act of justice, might have saved the <NORP>Romans</NORP> from the tyranny of his worthless son.
 Placed in the same situation, he experienced how easily the rigour of a judge dissolves away in the tenderness of a parent.
 He deliberated, he threatened, but he could not punish; and this last and only instance of mercy was more fatal to the empire than a long series of cruelty.
(16) The disorder of his mind irritated the pains of his body; he wished impatiently for death and hastened the instant of it by his impatience.
 He expired (A.
D.
 211, February 4th) at <GPE>York</GPE> in the sixty-fifth year of his life, and in the eighteenth of a glorious and successful reign.
 In his last moments he recommended concord to his sons, and his sons to the army.
 The salutary advice never reached the heart, or even the understanding, of the impetuous youths; but the more obedient troops, mindful of their oath of allegiance, and of the authority of their deceased master, resisted the solicitations of Caracalla, and proclaimed both brothers emperors of Rome.
 The new princes soon left the <NORP>Caledonians</NORP> in peace, returned to the capital, celebrated their father's funeral with divine honours, and were cheerfully acknowledged as lawful sovereigns, by the senate, the people, and the provinces.
 Some pre-eminence of rank seems to have been allowed to the elder brother; but they both administered the empire with equal and independent power.
(17) Jealousy and hatred of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors Such a divided form of government would have proved a source of discord between the most affectionate brothers.
 It was impossible that it could long subsist between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> implacable enemies, who neither desired nor could trust a reconciliation.
 It was visible that <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> only could reign, and that the other must fall; and each of them judging of his rival's designs by his own, guarded his life with the most jealous vigilance from the repeated attacks of poison or the sword.
 Their rapid journey through <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Italy, during which they never ate at the same table, or slept in the same house, displayed to the provinces the odious spectacle of fraternal discord.
 On their arrival at Rome, they immediately divided the vast extent of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> palace.
(18) No communication was allowed between their apartments: the doors and passages were diligently fortified, and guards posted and relieved with the same strictness as in a besieged place.
 The emperors met only in public, in the presence of their afflicted mother; and each surrounded by a numerous train of armed followers.
 Even on these occasions of ceremony, the dissimulation of courts could ill disguise the rancour of their hearts.
(19) Fruitless negotiation for dividing the empire between them This latent civil war already distracted the whole government, when a scheme was suggested that seemed of mutual benefit to the hostile brothers.
 It was proposed, that since it was impossible to reconcile their minds, they should separate their interest, and divide the empire between them.
 The conditions of the treaty were already drawn with some accuracy.
 It was agreed that Caracalla, as the elder brother, should remain in possession of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and the western Africa; and that he should relinquish the sovereignty of <LOC>Asia</LOC> and <GPE>Egypt</GPE> to Geta, who might fix his residence at <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> or Antioch, cities little inferior to <GPE>Rome</GPE> itself in wealth and greatness; that numerous armies should be constantly encamped on either side of the Thracian Bosphorus, to guard the frontiers of the rival monarchies; and that the senators of <NORP>European</NORP> extraction should acknowledge the sovereign of Rome, whilst the natives of <LOC>Asia</LOC> followed the emperor of the East.
 The tears of the empress <PERSON>Julia</PERSON> interrupted the negotiation, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> idea of which had filled every <NORP>Roman</NORP> breast with surprise and indignation.
 The mighty mass of conquest was so intimately united by the hand of time and policy, that it required the most forcible violence to rend it asunder.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> had reason to dread that the disjoined members would soon be reduced by a civil war under the dominion of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> master; but if the separation was permanent, the division of the provinces must terminate in the dissolution of an empire whose unity had hitherto remained inviolate.
(20) Murder of <PERSON>Geta</PERSON> Had the treaty been carried into execution, the sovereign of <LOC>Europe</LOC> might soon have been the conqueror of Asia; but <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> obtained an easier though a more guilty victory.
 He artfully listened to his mother's entreaties, and consented (A.
D.
 212, 27th February) to meet his brother in her apartment, on terms of peace and reconciliation.
 In the midst of their conversation, some centurions, who had contrived to conceal themselves, rushed with drawn swords upon the unfortunate Geta.
 His distracted mother strove to protect him in her arms; but, in the unavailing struggle, she was wounded in the hand, and covered with the blood of her younger son, while she saw the elder animating and assisting(21) the fury of the assassins.
 As soon as the deed was perpetrated, Caracalla, with hasty steps, and horror in his countenance, ran towards the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> camp as his only refuge, and threw himself on the ground before the statues of the tutelar deities.
 (22) The soldiers attempted to raise and comfort him.
 In broken and disordered words he informed them of his imminent danger and fortunate escape; insinuating that he had prevented the designs of his enemy, and declared his resolution to live and die with his faithful troops.
 <PERSON>Geta</PERSON> had been the favourite of the soldiers; but complaint was useless, revenge was dangerous, and they still reverenced the son of Severus.
 Their discontent died away in idle murmurs, and <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> soon convinced them of the justice of his cause, by distributing in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> lavish donative the accumulated treasures of his father's reign.
(23) The real sentiments of the soldiers alone were of importance to his power or safety.
 Their declaration in his favour commanded the dutiful professions of the senate.
 The obsequious assembly was always prepared to ratify the decision of fortune; but as <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> wished to assuage the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of public indignation, the name of <PERSON>Geta</PERSON> was mentioned with decency, and he received the funeral honours of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
(24) Posterity, in pity to his misfortune, has cast a veil over his vices.
 We consider that young prince as the innocent victim of his brother's ambition, without recollecting that he himself wanted power, rather than inclination, to consummate the same attempts of revenge and murder.
 Remorse and cruelty of <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> The crime went not unpunished.
 Neither business, nor pleasure, nor flattery, could defend <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> from the stings of a guilty conscience; and he confessed, in the anguish of a tortured mind, that his disordered fancy often beheld the angry forms of his father and his brother rising into life, to threaten and upbraid him.
(25) The consciousness of his crime should have induced him to convince mankind, by the virtues of his reign, that the bloody deed had been the involuntary effect of fatal necessity.
 But the repentance of <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> only prompted him to remove from the world whatever could remind him of his guilt, or recall the memory of his murdered brother.
 On his return from the senate to the palace, he found his mother in the company of several noble matrons, weeping over the untimely fate of her younger son.
 The jealous emperor threatened them with instant death; the sentence was executed against Fadilla, the last remaining daughter of the emperor Marcus; and even the afflicted <PERSON>Julia</PERSON> was obliged to silence her lamentations, to suppress her sighs, and to receive the assassin with smiles of joy and approbation.
 It was computed that, under the vague appellation of the friends of Geta, above twenty thousand persons of both sexes suffered death.
 His guards and freedmen, the ministers of his serious business, and the companions of his looser hours, those who by his interest had been promoted to any commands in the army or provinces, with the long-connected chain of their dependents, were included in the proscription; which endeavoured to reach every <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> who had maintained the smallest correspondence with Geta, who lamented his death, or who even mentioned his name.
(26) Helvius Pertinax, son to the prince of that name, lost his life by an unseasonable witticism.
 (27) It was a sufficient crime of Thrasea Priscus, to be descended from a family in which the love of liberty seemed an hereditary quality.
(28) The particular causes of calumny and suspicion were at length exhausted; and when a senator was accused of being a secret enemy to the government, the emperor was satisfied with the general proof that he was a man of property and virtue.
 From this well-grounded principle he frequently drew the most bloody inferences.
 The execution of so many innocent citizens was bewailed by the secret tears of their friends and families.
 The death of Papinian, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, was lamented as a public calamity.
 During the last seven <DATE>years</DATE> of Severus, he had exercised the most important office of the state, and, by his salutary influence, guided the emperor's steps in the paths of justice and moderation.
 In full assurance of his virtues and abilities Severus, on his deathbed, had conjured him to watch over the prosperity and union of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> family.
(29) The honest labours of <NORP>Papinian</NORP> served only to inflame the hatred which <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> had already conceived against his father's minister.
 After the murder of Geta, the <PERSON>Praefect</PERSON> was commanded to exert the powers of his skill and eloquence in a studied apology for that atrocious deed.
 The philosophic <PERSON>Seneca</PERSON> had condescended to compose a similar epistle to the senate, in the name of the son and assassin of Agrippina.
(30) That it was easier to commit than to justify a "parricide," was the glorious reply of Papinian, (31) who did not hesitate between the loss of life and that of honour.
 Such intrepid virtue, which had escaped pure and unsullied from the intrigues of courts, the habits of business, and the arts of his profession, reflects more lustre on the memory of Papinian, than all his great employments, his numerous writings, and the superior reputation as a lawyer, which he has preserved through every age of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence.
(32) His tyranny extended over the whole empire It had hitherto been the peculiar felicity of the Romans, and in the worst of times their consolation, that the virtue of the emperors was active, and their vice indolent.
 Augustus, Trajan, Hadrian, and Marcus, visited their extensive dominions in person, and their progress was marked by acts of wisdom and beneficence.
 The tyranny of Tiberius, Nero, and Domitian, who resided almost constantly at Rome, or in the adjacent villas, was confined to the senatorial and equestrian orders.
(33) But <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> was the common enemy of mankind.
 He left (A.
D.
 213) the capital (and he never returned to it) about a year after the murder of Geta.
 The rest of his reign was spent in the several provinces of the empire, particularly those of the East, and every province was by turns the scene of his rapine and cruelty.
 The senators, compelled by fear to attend his capricious motions, were obliged to provide <DATE>daily</DATE> entertainments at an immense expense, which he abandoned with contempt to his guards and to erect, in every city, magnificent palaces and theatres, which he either disdained to visit, or ordered to be immediately thrown down.
 The most wealthy families were ruined by partial fines and confiscations, and the great body of his subjects oppressed by ingenious and aggravated taxes.
(34) In the midst of peace, and upon the slightest provocation, he issued his commands, at <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> in Egypt, for a general massacre.
 From a secure post in the temple of Serapis, he viewed and directed the slaughter of many thousand citizens, as well as strangers, without distinguishing either the number or the crime of the sufferers; since, as he coolly informed the senate, all the Alexandrians, those who had perished and those who had escaped, were alike guilty.
(35) Relaxation of discipline The wise instructions of <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> never made any lasting impression on the mind of his son, who, although not destitute of imagination and eloquence, was equally devoid of judgment and humanity.
(36) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> dangerous maxim, worthy of a tyrant, was remembered and abused by Caracalla, "To secure the affections of the army, and to esteem the rest of his subjects as of little moment.
" (37) But the liberality of the father had been restrained by prudence, and his indulgence to the troops was tempered by firmness and authority.
 The careless profusion of the son was the policy of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> reign, and the inevitable ruin both of the army and of the empire.
 The vigour of the soldiers, instead of being confirmed by the severe discipline of camps, melted away in the luxury of cities.
 The excessive increase of their pay and donatives(38) exhausted the state to enrich the military order, whose modesty in peace, and service in war, is best secured by an honourable poverty.
 The demeanour of <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> was haughty and full of pride; but with the troops he forgot even the proper dignity of his rank, encouraged their insolent familiarity, and, neglecting the essential duties of a general, affected to imitate the dress and manners of a common soldier.
 Murder of Caracalla.
 A.
D.
 217, 8th March.
 It was impossible that such a character, and such a conduct as that of Caracalla, could inspire either love or esteem; but as long as his vices were beneficial to the armies, he was secure from the danger of rebellion.
 A secret conspiracy, provoked by his own jealousy, was fatal to the tyrant.
 The <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefecture was divided between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> ministers.
 The military department was intrusted to Adventus, an experienced rather than an able soldier; and the civil affairs were transacted by Opilius Macrinus, who, by his dexterity in business, had raised himself, with a fair character, to that high office.
 But his favour varied with the caprice of the emperor, and his life might depend on the slightest suspicion, or the most casual circumstance.
 Malice or fanaticism had suggested to an African, deeply skilled in the knowledge of futurity, a very dangerous prediction, that <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> and his son were destined to reign over the empire.
 The report was soon diffused through the province; and when the man was sent in chains to Rome, he still asserted, in the presence of the <PERSON>Praefect</PERSON> of the city, the faith of his prophecy.
 That magistrate, who had received the most pressing instructions to inform himself of the successors of Caracalla, immediately communicated the examination of the <NORP>African</NORP> to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court, which at that time resided in Syria.
 But, notwithstanding the diligence of the public messengers, a friend of <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> found means to apprise him of the approaching danger.
 The emperor received the letters from Rome; and as he was then engaged in the conduct of a chariot-race, he delivered them unopened to the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> Praefect, directing him to dispatch the ordinary affairs, and to report the more important business that might be contained in them.
 <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> read his fate, and resolved to prevent it.
 He inflamed the discontents of some inferior officers, and employed the hand of Martialis, a desperate soldier, who had been refused the rank of centurion.
 The devotion of <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> prompted him to make a pilgrimage from <GPE>Edessa</GPE> to the celebrated temple of the <PERSON>Moon</PERSON> at Carrhae.
 (39) He (A.
D.
 217, 8th March) was attended by a body of cavalry; but having stopped on the road for some necessary occasion, his guards preserved a respectful distance, and <PERSON>Martialis</PERSON> approaching his person under a pretence of duty, stabbed him with a dagger.
 The bold assassin was instantly killed by a <NORP>Scythian</NORP> archer of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> guard.
 Such was the end of a monster whose life disgraced human nature, and whose reign accused the patience of the Romans.
 The grateful soldiers forgot his vices remembered only his partial liberality, and obliged the senate to prostitute their own dignity and that of religion by granting him a place among the gods.
 Whilst he was upon earth, <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Great was the only hero whom this god deemed worthy his admiration.
 He assumed the name and ensigns of Alexander, formed a <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> phalanx of guards, persecuted the disciples of Aristotle, and displayed with a puerile enthusiasm the only sentiment by which he discovered any regard for virtue or glory.
 We can easily conceive, that after the battle of Narva, and the conquest of Poland, Charles the Twelfth (though he still wanted the more elegant accomplishments of the son of Philip) might boast of having rivalled his valour and magnanimity, but in no <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> action of his life did <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> express the faintest resemblance of the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> hero, except in the murder of a great number of his own and of his father's friends.
(40) Election and character of <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> After the extinction of the house of Severus, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world remained <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <DATE>days</DATE> without a master.
 The choice of the army (for the authority of a distant and feeble senate was little regarded) hung in an anxious suspense; as no candidate presented himself whose distinguished birth and merit could engage their attachment and unite their suffrages.
 The decisive weight of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards elevated the hopes of their praefects, and these powerful ministers began to assert their legal claim to fill the vacancy of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> throne.
 Adventus, however, the senior praefect, conscious of his age and infirmities, of his small reputation, and his smaller abilities, resigned the dangerous honour to the crafty ambition of his colleague Macrinus, whose well-dissembled grief removed all suspicion of his being accessory to his master's death.
(41) The troops neither loved nor esteemed his character.
 They cast their eyes around in search of a competitor, and at last yielded with reluctance to his promises of unbounded liberality and indulgence.
 A short time after his accession (A.
D.
 217, March 11th ) he conferred on his son Diadumenianus, at the age of only ten years, the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> title and the popular name of Antoninus.
 The beautiful figure of the youth, assisted by an additional donative, for which the ceremony furnished a pretext, might attract, it was hoped, the favour of the army, and secure the doubtful throne of Macrinus.
 Discontent of the senate The authority of the new sovereign had been ratified by the cheerful submission of the senate and provinces.
 They exulted in their unexpected deliverance from a hated tyrant, and it seemed of little consequence to examine into the virtues of the successor of Caracalla.
 But as soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> transports of joy and surprise had subsided, they began to scrutinise the merits of <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> with a critical severity, and to arraign the hasty choice of the army.
 It had hitherto been considered as a fundamental maxim of the constitution, that the emperor must be always chosen in the senate, and the sovereign power, no longer exercised by the whole body, was always delegated to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of its members.
 But <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> was not a senator.
(42) The sudden elevation of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefects betrayed the meanness of their origin; and the equestrian order was still in possession of that great office, which commanded with arbitrary sway the lives and fortunes of the senate.
 A murmur of indignation was heard, that a man whose obscure(43) extraction had never been illustrated by any signal service, should dare to invest himself with the purple, instead of bestowing it on some distinguished senator, equal in birth and dignity to the splendour of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> station.
 As soon as the character of <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> was surveyed by the sharp eye of discontent, some vices, and many defects, were easily discovered.
 The choice of his ministers was in many instances justly censured, and the dissatisfied people, with their usual candour, accused at once his indolent tameness and his excessive severity.
(44) and the army His rash ambition had climbed a height where it was difficult to stand with firmness, and impossible to fall without instant destruction.
 Trained in the arts of courts, and the forms of civil business, he trembled in the presence of the fierce and undisciplined multitude, over whom he had assumed the command.
 His military talents were despised, and his personal courage suspected; a whisper that circulated in the camp disclosed the fatal secret of the conspiracy against the late emperor, aggravated the guilt of murder by the baseness of hypocrisy, and heightened contempt by detestation.
 To alienate the soldiers, and to provoke inevitable ruin, the character of a reformer was only wanting: and such was the peculiar hardship of his fate, that <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> was compelled to exercise that invidious office.
 The prodigality of <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> had left behind it a long train of ruin and disorder; and if that worthless tyrant had been capable of reflecting on the sure consequences of his own conduct, he would perhaps have enjoyed the dark prospect of the distress and calamities which he bequeathed to his successors.
 <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> attempts a reformation of the army.
 In the management of this necessary reformation, <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> proceeded with a cautious prudence, which would have restored health and vigour to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army, in an easy and almost imperceptible manner.
 To the soldiers already engaged in the service, he was constrained to leave the dangerous privileges and extravagant pay given by Caracalla; but the new recruits were received on the more moderate though liberal establishment of Severus, and gradually formed to modesty and obedience.
 (45) <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> fatal error destroyed the salutary effects of this judicious plan.
 The numerous army, assembled in the <LOC>East</LOC> by the late emperor, instead of being immediately dispersed by <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> through the several provinces, was suffered to remain united in Syria, during the <DATE>winter</DATE> that followed his elevation.
 In the luxurious idleness of their quarters, the troops viewed their strength and numbers, communicated their complaints, and revolved in their minds the advantages of another revolution.
 The veterans, instead of being flattered by the advantageous distinction, were alarmed by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the emperor, which they considered as the presage of his future intentions.
 The recruits, with sullen reluctance, entered on a service, whose labours were increased while its rewards were diminished by a covetous and unwarlike sovereign.
 The murmurs of the army swelled with impunity into seditious clamours; and the partial mutinies betrayed a spirit of discontent and disaffection, that waited only for the slightest occasion to break out on every side into a general rebellion.
 To minds thus disposed, the occasion soon presented itself.
 Death of the empress <PERSON>Julia</PERSON> The empress <PERSON>Julia</PERSON> had experienced all the vicissitudes of fortune.
 From an humble station she had been raised to greatness, only to taste the superior bitterness of an exalted rank.
 she was doomed to weep over the death of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of her sons, and over the life of the other.
 The cruel fate of Caracalla, though her good sense must have long taught her to expect it, awakened the feelings of a mother and of an empress.
 Notwithstanding the respectful civility expressed by the usurper towards the widow of Severus, she descended with a painful struggle into the condition of a subject, and soon withdrew herself by a voluntary death from the anxious and humiliating dependence.
 <PERSON>Julia</PERSON> Maosa, her sister, was ordered to leave the court and Antioch.
(46) She retired to <PERSON>Emesa</PERSON> with an immense fortune, the fruit of twenty years' favour, accompanied by her <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> daughters, <PERSON>Soaemias</PERSON> and Mamma, each of whom was a widow, and each had an only son.
 Bassianus, for that was the name of the son of Soaemias, was consecrated to the honourable ministry of high priest of the Sun; and this holy vocation, embraced either from prudence or superstition, contributed to raise the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> youth to the empire of Rome.
 A numerous body of troops was stationed at Emesa; and, as the severe discipline of <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> had constrained them to pass the <DATE>winter</DATE> encamped, they were eager to revenge the cruelty of such unaccustomed hardships.
 The soldiers, who resorted in crowds to the temple of the Sun, beheld with veneration and delight the elegant dress and figure of a young Pontiff: they recognised, or they thought that they recognised, the features of Caracalla, whose memory they now adored.
 The artful <PERSON>Maosa</PERSON> saw and cherished their rising partiality, and readily sacrificing her daughter's reputation to the fortune of her grandson, she insinuated that <PERSON>Bassianus</PERSON> was the natural son of their murdered sovereign.
 The sums distributed by her emissaries with a lavish hand silenced every objection, and the profusion sufficiently proved the affinity, or at least the resemblance, of <PERSON>Bassianus</PERSON> with the great original.
 The young <PERSON>Antoninus</PERSON> (for he had assumed and polluted that respectable name) was (A.
D.
 218, May 16) declared emperor by the troops of Emesa, asserted his hereditary right, and called aloud on the armies to follow the standard of a young and liberal prince, who had taken up arms to revenge his father's death and the oppression of the military order.
(47) Defeat and death of <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> Whilst a conspiracy of women and eunuchs was concerted with prudence, and conducted with rapid vigour, Macrinus, who, by a decisive motion, might have crushed his infant enemy, floated between the opposite extremes of terror and security, which alike fixed him inactive at Antioch.
 A spirit of rebellion diffused itself through all the camps and garrisons of Syria, successive detachments murdered their officers,(48) and joined the party of the rebels; and the tardy restitution of military pay and privileges was imputed to the acknowledged weakness of Macrinus.
 At length he marched out of Antioch, to meet the increasing and zealous army of the young pretender.
 His own troops seemed to take the field with faintness and reluctance; but (A.
D.
 218, June 7), in the heat of the battle,(49) the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards, almost by an involuntary impulse, asserted the superiority of their valour and discipline.
 The rebel ranks were broken; when the mother and grandmother of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> prince, who, according to their eastern custom, had attended the army, threw themselves from their covered chariots, and, by exciting the compassion of the soldiers, endeavoured to animate their drooping courage.
 <PERSON>Antoninus</PERSON> himself, who, in the rest of his life, never acted like a man, in this important crisis of his fate approved himself a hero, mounted his horse, and, at the head of his rallied troops, charged sword in hand among the thickest of the enemy; whilst the eunuch Gannys, whose occupations had been confined to female cares and the soft luxury of Asia, displayed the talents of an able and experienced general.
 The battle still raged with doubtful violence, and <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> might have obtained the victory, had he not betrayed his own cause by a shameful and precipitate flight.
 His cowardice served only to protract his life a few days, and to stamp deserved ignominy on his misfortunes.
 It is scarcely necessary to add, that his son <PERSON>Diadumenianus</PERSON> was involved in the same fate.
 As soon as the stubborn <NORP>Praetorians</NORP> could be convinced that they fought for a prince who had basely deserted them, they surrendered to the conqueror; the contending parties of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army, mingling tears of joy and tenderness, united under the banners of the imagined son of Caracalla, and the <LOC>East</LOC> acknowledged with pleasure the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emperor of <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> extraction.
 <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> writes to the senate The letters of <PERSON>Macrinus</PERSON> had condescended to inform the senate of the slight disturbance occasioned by an impostor in Syria, and a decree immediately passed, declaring the rebel and his family public enemies; with a promise of pardon, however, to such of his deluded adherents as should merit it by an immediate return to their duty.
 During the twenty <DATE>days</DATE> that elapsed from the declaration to the victory of <PERSON>Antoninus</PERSON> (for in so short an interval was the fate of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world decided), the capital and the provinces, more especially those of the East, were distracted with hopes and fears, agitated with tumult, and stained with a useless effusion of civil blood, since whosoever of the rivals prevailed in Syria, must reign over the empire.
 The specious letters in which the young conqueror announced his victory to the obedient senate, were filled with professions of virtue and moderation; the shining examples of <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> he should ever consider as the great rule of his administration; and he affected to dwell with pride on the striking resemblance of his own age and fortunes with those of Augustus, Who in the earliest youth had revenged by a successful war the murder of his father.
 By adopting the style of <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> Aurelius Antoninus, son of <PERSON>Antoninus</PERSON> and grandson of Severus, he tacitly asserted his hereditary claim to the empire; but, by assuming the tribunitian and proconsular powers before they had been conferred on him by a decree of the senate, he offended the delicacy of <NORP>Roman</NORP> prejudice.
 This new and injudicious violation of the constitution was probably dictated either by the ignorance of his <NORP>Syrian</NORP> courtiers, or the fierce disdain of his military followers.
(50) Picture of <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> As the attention of the new emperor was diverted by the most trifling amusements, he (A.
D.
 219) wasted many months in his luxurious progress from <GPE>Syria</GPE> to Italy, passed at <ORG>Nicomedia</ORG> his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <DATE>winter</DATE> after his victory, and deferred till the ensuing <DATE>summer</DATE> his triumphal entry into the capital.
 A faithful picture, however, which preceded his arrival, and was placed by his immediate order over the altar of Victory in the senate-house, conveyed to the <NORP>Romans</NORP> the just but unworthy resemblance of his person and manners.
 He was drawn in his sacerdotal robes of silk and gold, after the loose flowing fashion of the <NORP>Medes</NORP> and Phoenicians; his head was covered with a lofty tiara, his numerous collars and bracelets were adorned with gems of an inestimable value.
 His eyebrows were tinged with black, and his cheeks painted with an artificial red and white.
 (51) The grave senators confessed with a sigh, that, after having long experienced the stern tyranny of their own countrymen, <GPE>Rome</GPE> was at length humbled beneath the effeminate luxury of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> despotism.
 His superstition The <PERSON>Sun</PERSON> was worshipped at Emesa, under the name of Elagabalus,(52) and under the form of a black conical stone, which, as it was universally believed, had fallen from heaven on that sacred place.
 To this protecting deity, Antoninus, not without some reason, ascribed his elevation to the throne.
 The display of superstitious gratitude was the only serious business of his reign.
 The triumph of the God of <PERSON>Emesa</PERSON> over all the religions of the earth, was the great object of his zeal and vanity: and the appellation of <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> (for he presumed as pontiff and favourite to adopt that sacred name) was dearer to him than all the titles of <ORG>Imperial</ORG> greatness.
 In a solemn procession through the streets of Rome, the way was strewed with gold dust; the black stone, set in precious gems, was placed on a chariot drawn by <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> milk-white horses richly caparisoned.
 The pious emperor held the reins, and, supported by his ministers, moved slowly backwards, that he might perpetually enjoy the felicity of the divine presence.
 In a magnificent temple raised on the Palatine Mount, the sacrifices of the god of <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> were celebrated with every circumstance of cost and solemnity.
 The richest wines, the most extraordinary victims, and the rarest aromatics, were profusely consumed on his altar.
 Around the altar a chorus of <NORP>Syrian</NORP> damsels performed their lascivious dances to the sound of barbarian music, whilst the gravest personages of the state and army, clothed in long <NORP>Phoenician</NORP> tunics, officiated in the meanest functions, with affected zeal and secret indignation.
(53) To this temple, as to the common centre of religious worship, the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> fanatic attempted to remove the Ancilia, the Palladium,(54) and all the sacred pledges of the faith of Numa.
 A crowd of inferior deities attended in various stations the majesty of the god of Emesa; but his court was still imperfect, till a female of distinguished rank was admitted to his bed.
 <PERSON>Pallas</PERSON> had been <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> chosen for his comfort; but as it was dreaded lest her warlike terrors might affright the soft delicacy of a <NORP>Syrian</NORP> deity, the Moon, adored by the <NORP>Africans</NORP> under the name of Astarte, was deemed a more suitable companion for the Sun.
 Her image, with the rich offerings of her temple as a marriage portion was transported with solemn pomp from <GPE>Carthage</GPE> to Rome, and the day of these mystic nuptials was a general festival in the capital and throughout the empire.
(55) His profligate and effeminate luxury A rational voluptuary adheres with invariable respect to the temperate dictates of nature, and improves the gratifications of sense by social intercourse, endearing connections, and the soft colouring of taste and the imagination.
 But <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> (I speak of the emperor of that name), corrupted by his youth, his country, and his fortune, abandoned himself to the grossest pleasures with ungoverned fury, and soon found disgust and satiety in the midst of his enjoyments.
 The inflammatory powers of art were summoned to his aid: the confused multitude of women, of wines, and of dishes, and the studied variety of attitudes and sauces, served to revive his languid appetites.
 New terms and new inventions in these sciences, the only ones cultivated and patronised by the monarch, (56) signalised his reign, and transmitted his infamy to succeeding times.
 A capricious prodigality supplied the want of taste and elegance; and whilst <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> lavished away the treasures of his people in the wildest extravagance, his own voice and that of his flatterers applauded a spirit and magnificence unknown to the tameness of his predecessors.
 To confound the order of seasons and climates, (57) to sport with the passions and prejudices of his subjects, and to subvert every law of nature and decency, were in the number of his most delicious amusements.
 A long train of concubines, and a rapid succession of wives, among whom was a vestal virgin, ravished by force from her sacred asylum, (58) were insufficient to satisfy the impotence of his passions.
 The master of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world affected to copy the dress and manners of the female sex, preferred the distaff to the sceptre, and dishonoured the principal dignities of the empire by distributing them among his numerous lovers; <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of whom was publicly invested with the title and authority of the emperor's, or, as he more properly styled himself, of the empress's husband.
(59) Contempt of decency which distinguished the <NORP>Roman</NORP> tyrants It may seem probable, the vices and follies of <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> have been adorned by fancy, and blackened by prejudice.
(60) Yet confining ourselves to the public scenes displayed before the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, and attested by grave and contemporary historians, their inexpressible infamy surpasses that of any other age or country.
 The licence of an eastern monarch is secluded from the eye of curiosity by the inaccessible walls of his seraglio.
 The sentiments of honour and gallantry have introduced a refinement of pleasure, a regard for decency, and a respect for the public opinion, into the modern courts of Europe; but the corrupt and opulent nobles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> gratified every vice that could be collected from the mighty conflux of nations and manners.
 Secure of impunity, careless of censure, they lived without restraint in the patient and humble society of their slaves and parasites.
 The emperor, in his turn, viewing every rank of his subjects with the same contemptuous indifference, asserted without control his sovereign privilege of lust and luxury.
 Discontents of the army The most worthless of mankind are not afraid to condemn in others the same disorders which they allow in themselves; and can readily discover some nice difference of age, character, or station, to justify the partial distinction.
 The licentious soldiers, who had raised to the throne the dissolute son of Caracalla, blushed at their ignominious choice, and turned with disgust from that monster, to contemplate with pleasure the opening virtues of his cousin <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the son of Mamaea.
 The crafty Maesa, sensible that her grandson <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> must inevitably destroy himself by his own vices, had provided another and surer support of her family.
 Embracing a favourable moment of fondness and devotion, she had persuaded the young emperor to adopt Alexander, and to invest him with the title of Caesar(A.
D.
 221), that his own divine occupations might be no longer interrupted by the care of the earth.
 In the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> rank that amiable prince soon acquired the affections of the public, and excited the tyrant's jealousy, who resolved to terminate the dangerous competition, either by corrupting the manners, or by taking away the life, of his rival.
 His arts proved unsuccessful; his vain designs were constantly discovered by his own loquacious folly, and disappointed by those virtuous and faithful servants whom the prudence of <PERSON>Mamaea</PERSON> had placed about the person of her son.
 In a hasty sally of passion, <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> resolved to execute by force what he had been unable to compass by fraud, and by a despotic sentence degraded his cousin from the rank and honours of Caesar.
 The message was received in the senate with silence, and in the camp with fury.
 The <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards swore to protect Alexander, and to revenge the dishonoured majesty of the throne.
 The tears and promises of the trembling Elagabalus, who only begged them to spare his life, and to leave him in the possession of his beloved Hierocles, diverted their just indignation and they contented themselves with empowering their praefects to watch over the safety of Alexander, and the conduct of the emperor.
 (61) Sedition of the guards, and murder of Elagabalus.
 It was impossible that such a reconciliation should last, or that even the mean soul of <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> could hold an empire on such humiliating terms of dependence.
 He soon attempted, by a dangerous experiment, to try the temper of the soldiers.
 The report of the death of Alexander, and the natural suspicion that he had been murdered, inflamed their passions into fury, and the tempest of the camp could only be appeased by the presence and authority of the popular youth.
 Provoked at this new instance of their affection for his cousin, and their contempt for his persons the emperor ventured to punish some of the leaders of the mutiny.
 His unseasonable severity proved instantly fatal to his minions, his mother, and himself.
 <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> was (A.
D.
 222, 10th March) massacred by the indignant Praetorians, his mutilated corpse dragged through the streets of the city, and thrown into the Tiber.
 His memory was branded with eternal infamy by the senate; the justice of whose decree has been ratified by posterity.
(62) Accession of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> Severus.
 In the room of Elagabalus, his cousin <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> was raised to the throne by the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards.
 His relation to the family of Severus, whose name he assumed, was the same as that of his predecessor; his virtue and his danger had already endeared him to the Romans, and the eager liberality of the senate conferred upon him, in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day, the various titles and powers of tin <ORG>Imperial</ORG> dignity.
 (63) But as <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> was a modest and dutiful youth, of only seventeen <DATE>years</DATE> of age, the reins of government were in the hands of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> women, of his mother Mamaea, and of Maesa, his grandmother.
 After the death of the latter, who survived but a short time the elevation of Alexander, <PERSON>Mamaea</PERSON> remained the sole regent of her son and of the empire.
 Power of his mother Mamaea.
 In every age and country, the wiser, or at least the stronger, of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sexes, has usurped the powers of the state, and confined the other to the cares and pleasures of domestic life.
 In hereditary monarchies, however, and especially in those of modern Europe, the gallant spirit of chivalry, and the law of succession, have accustomed us to allow a singular exception; and a woman is often acknowledged the absolute sovereign of a great kingdom, in which she would be deemed incapable of exercising the smallest employment; civil or military.
 But as the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors were still considered as the generals and magistrates of the republic, their wives and mothers, although distinguished by the name of Augusta, were never associated to their personal honours; and a female reign would have appeared an inexpiable prodigy in the eyes of those primitive Romans, who married without love, or loved without delicacy and respect.
 (64) The haughty <PERSON>Agrippina</PERSON> aspired, indeed, to share the honours of the empire, which she had conferred on her son; but her mad ambition, detested by every citizen who felt for the dignity of Rome, was disappointed by the artful firmness of <PERSON>Seneca</PERSON> and Burrhus.
 (65) The good sense, or the indifference, of succeeding princes, restrained them from offending the prejudices of their subjects; and it was reserved for the profligate <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> to discharge the acts of the senate, with the name of his mother Soaemias, who was placed by the side of the consuls, and subscribed, as a regular member, the decrees of the legislative assembly.
 Her more prudent sister, Mamaea, declined the useless and odious prerogative, and a solemn law was enacted, excluding women for ever from the senate, and devoting to the infernal gods the head of the wretch by whom this sanction should be violated.
(66) The substance, not the pageantry, of power was the object of Mamaea's manly ambition.
 She maintained an absolute.
 and lasting empire over the mind of her son, and in his affection the mother could not brook a rival.
 Alexander, with her consent, married the daughter of a Patrician; but his respect for his father-in-law, and love for the empress, were inconsistent with the tenderness or interest of Mamaea.
 The <PERSON>Patrician</PERSON> was executed on the ready accusation of treason, and the wife of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> driven with ignominy from the palace, and banished into Africa.
(67) Wise and moderate administration.
 Notwithstanding this act of jealous cruelty, as well as some instances of avarice, with which <PERSON>Mamaea</PERSON> is charged, the general tenor of her administration was equally for the benefit of her son and of the empire.
 With the approbation of the senate, she chose <CARDINAL>sixteen</CARDINAL> of the wisest and most virtuous senators, as a perpetual council of state, before whom every public business of moment was debated and determined.
 The celebrated Ulpian, equally distinguished by his knowledge of, and his respect for, the laws of Rome, was at their head; and the prudent firmness of this aristocracy restored order and authority to the government.
 As soon as they had purged the city from foreign superstition and luxury, the remains of the capricious tyranny of Elagabalus, they applied themselves to remove his worthless creatures from every department of public administration, and to supply their places with men of virtue and ability.
 Learning, and the love of justice, became the only recommendations for civil offices; valour, and the love of discipline, the only qualifications for military employments.
(68) Education and virtuous temper of Alexander.
 But the most important care of <PERSON>Mamaea</PERSON> and her wise counsellors, was to form the character of the young emperor, on whose personal qualities the happiness or misery of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world must ultimately depend.
 The fortunate soil assisted, and even prevented, the hand of cultivation.
 An excellent understanding soon convinced <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> of the advantages of virtue, the pleasure of knowledge, and the necessity of labour.
 A natural mildness and moderation of temper preserved him from the assaults of passion, and the allurements of vice.
 His unalterable regard for his mother, and his esteem for the wise Ulpian, guarded his inexperienced youth from the poison of flattery.
 The simple journal of his ordinary occupations exhibits a pleasing picture of an accomplished emperor, (69) and with some allowance for the difference of manners, might well deserve the imitation of modern princes.
 <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> rose early; the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> moments of the day were consecrated to private devotion, and his domestic chapel was filled with the images of those heroes, who, by improving or reforming human life, had deserved the grateful reverence of posterity.
 But, as he deemed the service of mankind the most acceptable worship of the gods, the greatest part of his morning <TIME>hours</TIME> was employed in his council, where he discussed public affairs, and determined private causes, with a patience and discretion above his years.
 The dryness of business was relieved by the charms of literature; and a portion of time was always set apart for his favourite studies of poetry, history, and philosophy.
 The works of <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> and Horace, the Republics of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> and Cicero, formed his taste, enlarged his understanding, and gave him the noblest ideas of man and government.
 The exercises of the body succeeded to those of the mind; and Alexander, who was tall, active, and robust, surpassed most of his equals in the gymnastic arts.
 Refreshed by the use of the bath and a slight dinner, he resumed, with new vigour, the business of the day; and, till the hour of supper, the principal meal of the Romans, he was attended by his secretaries, with whom he read and answered the multitude of letters, memorials, and petitions, that must have been addressed to the master of the greatest part of the world.
 His table was served with the most frugal simplicity; and whenever he was at liberty to consult his own inclination, the company consisted of a few select friends, men of learning and virtue, amongst whom <NORP>Ulpian</NORP> was constantly invited.
 Their conversation was familiar and instructive; and the pauses were occasionally enlivened by the recital of some pleasing composition, which supplied the place of the dancers, comedians, and even gladiators, so frequently summoned to the tables of the rich and luxurious Romans.
 (70) The dress of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> was plain and modest, his demeanour courteous and affable: at the proper <TIME>hours</TIME> his palace was open to all his subjects, but the voice of a crier was heard, as in the <NORP>Eleusinian</NORP> mysteries, pronouncing the same salutary admonition; General happiness of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 Such an uniform tenor of life, which left not a moment for vice or folly, is a better proof of the wisdom and justice of Alexander's government, than all the trifling details preserved in the compilation of Lampridius.
 Since the accession of Commodus, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world had experienced, during a term of forty years, the successive and various vices of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> tyrants.
 From the death of <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> it enjoyed (A.
D.
 222-235) an auspicious calm of thirteen years.
 The provinces, relieved from the oppressive taxes invented by <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> and his pretended son, flourished in peace and prosperity, under the administration of magistrates, who were convinced by experience, that to deserve the love of the subjects was their best and only method of obtaining the favour of their sovereign.
 While some gentle restraints were imposed on the innocent luxury of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, the price of provisions, and the interest of money, were reduced, by the paternal care of Alexander, whose prudent liberality, without distressing the industrious, supplied the wants and amusements of the populace.
 The dignity, the freedom, the authority of the senate were restored; and every virtuous senator might approach the person of the emperor, without fear, and without a blush.
 <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> refuses the name of Antoninus.
 The name of Antoninus, ennobled by the virtues of <PERSON>Pius</PERSON> and Marcus, had been communicated by adoption to the dissolute Verus, and by descent to the cruel Commodus.
 It became the honourable appellation of the sons of Severus, was bestowed on young Diadumenianus, and at length prostituted to the infamy of the high priest of Emesa.
 Alexander, though pressed by the studied, and perhaps sincere, importunity of the senate, nobly refused the borrowed lustre of a name whilst in his whole conduct he laboured to restore the glories and felicity of the awe of the genuine Antonines.
(72) He attempts to reform the army.
 In the civil administration of Alexander, wisdom was enforced by power, and the people, sensible of the public felicity, repaid their benefactor with their love and gratitude.
 There still remained a greater, a more necessary, but a more difficult enterprise; the reformation of the military order, whose interest and temper, confirmed by long impunity, rendered them impatient of the restraints of discipline, and careless of the blessings of public tranquillity.
 In the execution of his design the emperor affected to display his love, and to conceal his fear, of the army.
 The most rigid economy in every other branch of the administration, supplied a fund of gold and silver for the ordinary pay and the extraordinary rewards of the troops.
 In their marches he relaxed the severe obligation of carrying seventeen days' provision on their shoulders.
 Ample magazines were formed along the public roads, and as soon as they entered the enemy's country, a numerous train of mules and camels waited on their haughty laziness.
 As <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> despaired of correcting the luxury of his soldiers, he attempted, at least, to direct it to objects at martial pomp and ornament, fine horses splendid armour, and shield enriched with silver and gold.
 He shared whatever fatigues he vas obliged to impose, visited, in person, the sick and wounded, preserved an exact register of their services and his own gratitude, and expressed on every occasion, the warmest regard for body of men whose welfare, as he affected to declare, was so closely connected with that of the State.
 (73) By the most gentle arts he laboured to inspire the fierce multitude with a sense of duty, and to restore at least a faint image of that discipline to which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> owed their empire over so many other nations, as warlike and more powerful than themselves.
 But his prudence was vain, his courage fatal, and the attempt towards a reformation served only to inflame the ills it was meant to cure.
 Seditions of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards, and murder of Ulpian.
 The <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards were attached to the Youth of Alexander.
 They loved him as a tender pupil, whom they had saved from a tyrant's fury, and placed on the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> throne.
 That amiable prince was sensible of; the obligation but as his gratitude was restrained within the limits of reason and justice, they soon were more dissatisfied with the virtues of Alexander, than they had ever been with the vices of Elagabalus.
 Their praefect, the wise Ulpian, was the friend of the laws and of the people; he was considered as the enemy of the soldiers, and to his pernicious counsels every scheme of reformation was imputed.
 Some trifling accident blew up their discontent into a furious mutiny; and a civil war raged, during <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days, in Rome, whilst the life of that excellent minister was defended by the grateful people.
 Terrified, at length, by the sight of some houses in flames, and by the threats of a general conflagration, the people yielded with a sigh, and left the virtuous, but unfortunate, <NORP>Ulpian</NORP> to his fate.
 He was pursued into the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> palace, and massacred at the feet of his master, who vainly strove to cover him with the purple, and to obtain his pardon from the inexorable soldiers.
 Such was the deplorable weakness of government, that the emperor was unable to revenge his murdered friend and his insulted dignity, without stooping to the arts of patience and dissimulation.
 Epagathus, the principal leader of the mutiny, was removed from Rome, by the honourable employment of praefect of Egypt; from that high rank he was gently degraded to the government of Crete; and when, at length, his popularity among the guards was effaced by time and absence, <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> ventured to inflict the tardy, but deserved punishment of his crimes.
(74) Under the reign of a just and virtuous prince, the tyranny of the army threatened with instant death his most faithful ministers, who were suspected of an intention to correct their intolerable disorders.
 The historian Dion Cassius had commanded the <NORP>Pannonian</NORP> legions with the spirit of ancient discipline.
 Their brethren of Rome, embracing the common cause of military licence, demanded the head of the reformer.
 Alexander, however, instead of yielding to their seditious clamours, showed a just sense of his merit and services, by appointing him his colleague in the consulship, and defraying from his own treasury the expense of that vain dignity: but as it was justly apprehended, that if the soldiers beheld him with the ensigns of his office, they would revenge the insult in his blood, the nominal <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate of the state retired, by the emperor's advice, from the city, and spent the greatest part of his consulship at his villas in Campania.
 (75) Tumult of the legions.
 The lenity of the emperor confirmed the insolence of the troops; the legions imitated the example of the guards, and defended their prerogative of licentiousness with the same furious obstinacy.
 The administration of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> was an unavailing struggle against the corruption of his age.
 In Illyricum, in Mauritania, in Armenia, in Mesopotamia, in Germany, fresh mutinies perpetually broke out; his officers were murdered, his authority was insulted, and his life at last sacrificed to the fierce discontents of the army.
 (76) Firmness of the emperor, <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> particular fact well deserves to be recorded, as it illustrates the manners of the troops, and exhibits a singular instance of their return to a sense of duty and obedience.
 Whilst the emperor lay at Antioch, in his <NORP>Persian</NORP> expedition, the particulars of which we shall hereafter relate, the punishment of some soldiers, who had been discovered in the baths of women, excited a sedition in the legion to which they belonged.
 <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> ascended his tribunal, and with a modest firmness represented to the armed multitude the absolute necessity as well as his inflexible resolution of correcting the vices introduced by his impure predecessor, and of maintaining the discipline, which could not be relaxed without the ruin of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name and empire.
 Their clamours interrupted his mild expostulation.
 His menaces inflamed the fury of the legion, and their brandished arms already threatened his person.
 The legion still persisted in clamorous sedition, when the emperor pronounced, with a loud voice, the decisive sentence, "Citizens! lay down your arms, and depart in peace to your respective habitations.
" The tempest was instantly appeased the soldiers, filled with grief and shame, silently confessed the justice of their punishment and the power of discipline, yielded up their arms and military ensigns, and retired in confusion, not to their camp, but to the several inns of the city.
 <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> enjoyed, during thirty days, the edifying spectacle of their repentance; nor did he restore them to their former rank in the army, till he had punished with death those tribunes whose connivance had occasioned the mutiny.
 The grateful legion served the emperor, whilst living, and revenged him when dead.
(78) Defects of his reign and character.
 The resolutions of the multitude generally depend on a moment; and the caprice of passion might equally determine the seditious legion to lay down their arms at the emperor's feet, or to plunge them into his breast.
 Perhaps, if the singular transaction had been investigated by the penetration of a philosophers, we should discover the secret causes which on that occasion authorised the boldness of the prince, and commanded the obedience of the troops; and perhaps, if it had been related by a judicious historian, we should find this action, worthy of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> himself, reduced nearer to the level of probability and the common standard of the character of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> Severus.
 The abilities of that amiable prince seem to have been inadequate to the difficulties of his situation, the firmness of his conduct inferior to the purity of his intentions.
 His virtues as well as the vices of Elagabalus, contracted a tincture of weakness and effeminacy from the soft climate of Syria, of which he was a native; though he blushed at his foreign origin, and listened with a vain complacency to the flattering genealogists, who derived his race from the ancient stock of <NORP>Roman</NORP> nobility.
(79) The pride and avarice of his mother cast a shade on the glories of his reign; and by exacting from his riper <DATE>years</DATE> the sage dutiful obedience which she had justly claimed from his inexperienced youth, <PERSON>Mamaea</PERSON> exposed to public ridicule, both her son's character and her own.
 (80) The fatigues of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war irritated the military discontent; the unsuccessful event degraded the reputation of the emperor as a general, and even as a soldier.
 Every cause prepared, and every circumstance hastened, a revolution, which distracted the Roman, empire with a long series of intestine calamities Digression on the finances of the empire.
 The dissolute tyranny of Commodus, the civil wars occasioned by his death, and the new maxims of policy introduced by the house of Severus, had all contributed to increase the dangerous power of the army, and to obliterate the faint image of laws and liberty that was still impressed on the minds of the Romans.
 This internal change, which undermined the foundations of the empire, we have endeavoured to explain with some degree of order and perspicuity.
 The personal characters of the emperors, their victories, laws, follies, and fortunes, can interest us no farther than as they are connected with the general history of the Decline and Fall of the monarchy.
 Our constant attention to that great object will not suffer us to overlook a most important edict of <PERSON>Antoninus</PERSON> Caracalla, which communicated to all the free inhabitants of the empire the name and privileges of <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens.
 His unbounded liberality flowed not, however, from the sentiments of a generous mind; it was the sordid result of avarice, and will naturally be illustrated by some observations on the finances of that state, from the victorious ages of the commonwealth to the reign of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> Severus.
 Establishment.
 The siege of <PERSON>Veii</PERSON> in Tuscany, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> considerable enterprise of the Romans, was protracted to the tenth year, much less by the strength of the place than by the unskilfulness of the besiegers.
 The unaccustomed hardships of so many <DATE>winter</DATE> campaigns, at the distance of near twenty miles from home, (81) required more than common encouragements; and the senate wisely prevented the clamours of the people, by the institution of a regular pay for the soldiers, which was levied by a general tribute, assessed according to an equitable proportion on the property of the citizens.
(82) During more than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred <DATE>years</DATE> after the conquest of Veii, the victories of the republic added less to the wealth than to the power of Rome.
 The states of <GPE>Italy</GPE> paid their tribute in military service only, and the vast force both by sea and land, which was exerted in the Punic wars, was maintained at the expense of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves.
 That high-spirited people (such is often the generous enthusiasm of freedom) cheerfully submitted to the most excessive but voluntary burdens, in the just confidence that they should speedily enjoy the rich harvest of their labours.
 Their expectations were not disappointed.
 In the and abolition of the tribute on <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens course of a few years, the riches of Syracuse, of Carthage, of Macedonia, and of Asia, were brought in triumph to Rome.
 sterling and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, the sovereign of so many nations, was for ever delivered from the weight of taxes.
(83) The increasing revenue of the provinces was found sufficient to defray the ordinary establishment of war and government and the superfluous mass of gold and silver was deposited in the temple of Saturn, and reserved for any unforeseen emergency of the state.
(84) Tributes of the provinces.
 History has never perhaps suffered a greater or more irreparable injury, than in the loss of the curious register bequeathed by <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to the senate, in which that experienced prince so accurately balanced the revenues and expenses of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
(85) Deprived of this clear and comprehensive estimate, we are reduced to collect a few imperfect hints from such of the ancients as have accidentally turned aside from the splendid to the more useful parts of history.
 We are informed that, by the conquests of Pompey, the tributes of <LOC>Asia</LOC> were raised from fifty to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and thirty-five millions of drachms; or about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> millions and a half sterling.
(86) Under the last and most indolent of the Ptolemies, the revenue of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> is said to have amounted to twelve thousand five hundred talents; a sum equivalent to more than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> millions and a half of our money, but which was afterwards considerably improved by the more exact economy of the Romans, and the of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> increase of the trade of <GPE>Ethiopia</GPE> and India.
(87) <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was enriched by rapine, as <GPE>Egypt</GPE> was by commerce, and the tributes of those <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great provinces have been compared as nearly equal to each other in value.
(88) The ten thousand of <LOC>Africa</LOC> Euboic or <NORP>Phoenician</NORP> talents, about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> millions sterling, (89) which vanquished <GPE>Carthage</GPE> was condemned to pay within the term of fifty years, were a slight acknowledgment of the superiority of Rome,(90) and cannot bear the least proportion with the taxes afterwards raised both on the lands and on the persons of the inhabitants, when the fertile coast of <LOC>Africa</LOC> was reduced into a province.
(91) Spain, by a very singular fatality, was the <GPE>Peru</GPE> and <GPE>Mexico</GPE> of the old world.
 The discovery of the rich western continent by the Phoenicians, and the oppression of the simple natives, who were compelled to labour in their own mines for the benefit of strangers, form an exact type of the more recent history of Spanish America.
 (92) The <NORP>Phoenicians</NORP> were acquainted only with the sea-coast of Spain; avarice, as well as ambition, carried the arms of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Carthage</GPE> into the heart of the country, and almost every part of the soil was found pregnant with copper, silver, and gold.
 Mention is made of a mine near <GPE>Carthagena</GPE> which yielded every day twenty-five thousand drachms of silver, or about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred thousand pounds a year.
(93) Twenty thousand pound weight of gold was annually received from the provinces of Asturia, Gallicia, and Lusitania.
(94) of the isle of <GPE>Gyarus</GPE> We want both leisure and materials to pursue this curious inquiry through the many potent states that were annihilated in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 Some notion, however, may be formed of the revenue of the provinces where considerable wealth had been deposited by nature, or collected by man, if we observe the severe attention that was directed to the abodes of solitude and sterility.
 <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> once received a petition from the inhabitants of Gyarus, humbly praying that they might be relieved from <CARDINAL>one-third</CARDINAL> of their excessive impositions.
 Their whole tax amounted indeed to no more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and fifty drachms, or about five pounds; but Cyarus was a little island, or rather a rock, of the AEgean Sea, destitute of fresh water and every necessary of life, and inhabited only by a few wretched fishermen.
(95) Amount of the revenue From the faint glimmerings of such doubtful and scattered lights we should be inclined to believe, 1st, That (with every fair allowance for the difference of times and circumstances) the general income of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces could seldom amount to less than fifteen or twenty millions of our money; (96) and, 2ndly, That so ample a revenue must have been fully adequate to all the expenses of the moderate government instituted by Augustus, whose court was the modest family of a private senator, and whose military establishment was calculated for the defence of the frontiers, without any aspiring views of conquest, or any serious apprehension of a foreign invasion.
 Taxes on <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens instituted by <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> Notwithstanding the seeming probability of both these conclusions, the latter of them at least is positively disowned by the language and conduct of Augustus.
 It is not easy to determine whether, on this occasion, he acted as the common father of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, or as the oppressor of liberty; whether he wished to relieve the provinces, or to impoverish the senate and the equestrian order.
 But no sooner had he assumed the reins of government than he frequently intimated the insufficiency of the tributes, and the necessity of throwing an equitable proportion of the public burden upon <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy.
 In the prosecution of this unpopular design, he advanced, however, by cautious and well-weighed steps.
 The introduction of customs was followed by the establishment of an excise, and the scheme of taxation was completed by an artful assessment on the real and personal property of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens, who had been exempted from any kind of contribution above a century and a half.
 The customs.
 I.
 In a great empire like that of Rome, a natural balance of money must have gradually established itself.
 It has been already observed, that as the wealth of the provinces was attracted to the capital by the strong hand of conquest and power, so a considerable part of it was restored to the industrious provinces by the gentle influence of commerce and arts.
 In the reign of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and his successors, duties were imposed on every kind of merchandise, which through a thousand channels flowed to the great centre of opulence and luxury; and in whatsoever manner the law was expressed, it was the <NORP>Roman</NORP> purchaser, and not the provincial merchant, who paid the tax.
(97) The rate of the customs varied from the <ORDINAL>eighth</ORDINAL> to the fortieth part of the value of the commodity; and we have a right to suppose that the variation was directed by the unalterable maxims of policy: that a higher duty was fixed on the articles of luxury than on those of necessity, and that the productions raised or manufactured by the labour of the subjects of the empire were treated with more indulgence than was shown to the pernicious, or at least the unpopular, commerce of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> and India.
 (98) There is still extant a long but imperfect catalogue of eastern commodities, which about the time of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> were subject to the payment of duties; cinnamon, myrrh, pepper, ginger, and the whole tribe of aromatics, a great variety of precious stones, among which the diamond was the most remarkable for its price, and the emerald for its beauty, (99) Parthian and <NORP>Babylonian</NORP> leather, cottons, silks, both raw and manufactured, ebony, ivory, and eunuchs.
 (100) We may observe that the use and value of those effeminate slaves gradually rose with the decline of the empire.
 The excise II.
 The excise, introduced by <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> after the civil wars, was extremely moderate, but it was general.
 It seldom exceeded <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> per cent.
; but it comprehended whatever was sold in the markets or by public auction, from the most considerable purchases of lands and houses to those minute objects which can only derive a value from their infinite multitude and <DATE>daily</DATE> consumption.
 Such a tax, as it affects the body of the people, has ever been the occasion of clamour and discontent.
 An emperor well acquainted with the wants and resources of the state, was obliged to declare by a public edict that the support of the army depended in a great measure on the produce of the excise.
(101) Tax on legacies and inheritances III.
 When <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> resolved to establish a permanent military force for the defence of his government against foreign and domestic enemies, he instituted a peculiar treasury for the pay of the soldiers, the rewards of the veterans, and the extraordinary expenses of war.
 The ample revenue of the excise, though peculiarly appropriated to those uses, was found inadequate.
 To supply the deficiency, the emperor suggested a new tax of five per cent.
 on all legacies and inheritances.
 But the nobles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were more tenacious of property than of freedom.
 Their indignant murmurs were received by <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> with his usual temper.
 He candidly referred the whole business to the senate, and exhorted them to provide for the public service by some other expedient of a less odious nature.
 They were divided and perplexed.
 He insinuated to them that their obstinacy would oblige him to propose a general land-tax and capitation They acquiesced in silence.
 (102) The new imposition on legacies and inheritances was however mitigated by some restrictions.
 It did not take place unless the object was of a certain value, most probably of fifty or an hundred pieces of gold,(103) nor could it be exacted from the nearest of kin on the father's side.
(104) When the rights of nature and poverty were thus secured, it seemed reasonable that a stranger, or a distant relation, who acquired an unexpected accession of fortune, should cheerfully resign a <DATE>twentieth</DATE> part of it for the benefit of the state.
(105) Suited to the laws and manners.
 Such a tax, plentiful as it must prove in every wealthy community, was most happily suited to the situation of the Romans, who could frame their arbitrary wills, according to the dictates of reason or caprice, without any restraint from the modern fetters of entails and settlements.
 From various causes the partiality of paternal affection often lost its influence over the stern patriots of the commonwealth and the dissolute nobles of the empire; and if the father bequeathed to his son the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> part of his estate, he removed all ground of legal complaint.
(106) But a rich childless old man was a domestic tyrant, and his power increased with his <DATE>years</DATE> and infirmities.
 A servile crowd, in which he frequently reckoned praetors and consuls, courted his smiles, pampered his avarice, applauded his follies, served his passions, and waited with impatience for his death.
 The arts of attendance and flattery were formed into a most lucrative science; those who professed it acquired a peculiar appellation; and the whole city, according to the lively descriptions of satire, was divided between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> parties, the hunters and their game.
(107) Yet, while so many unjust and extravagant wills were every day dictated by cunning, and subscribed by folly, a few were the result of rational esteem and virtuous gratitude.
 Cicero, who had so often defended the lives and fortunes of his fellow-citizens, was rewarded with legacies to the amount of an hundred and seventy thousand pounds; (108) nor do the friends of the younger <PERSON>Pliny</PERSON> seem to have been less generous to that amiable orator.
 (109) Whatever was the motive of the testator, the treasury claimed, without distinction, the <DATE>twentieth</DATE> part of his estate; and in the course of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> generations, the whole property of the subject must have gradually passed through the coffers of the state.
 Regulations of the emperors In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and golden <DATE>years</DATE> of the reign of Nero, that prince, from a desire of popularity, and perhaps from a blind impulse of benevolence conceived a wish of abolishing the oppression of the customs and excise.
 The wisest senators applauded his magnanimity; but they diverted him from the execution of a design, which would have dissolved the strength and resources of the republic.
 (110) Had it indeed been possible to realise this dream of fancy, such princes as <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> and the <NORP>Antonines</NORP> would surely have embraced with ardour the glorious opportunity of conferring so signal an obligation on mankind.
 Satisfied, however, with alleviating the public burden, they attempted not to remove it.
 The mildness and precision of their laws ascertained the rule and measure of taxation, and protected the subject of every rank against arbitrary interpretations, antiquated claims, and the insolent vexation of the farmers of the revenue.
(111) For it is somewhat singular that, in every age, the best and wisest of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> governors persevered in this pernicious method of collecting the principal branches at least of the excise and customs.
(112) Edict of <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> The sentiments, and, indeed, the situation of Caracalla, were very different from those of the Antonines.
 Inattentive, or rather averse, to the welfare of his people, he found himself under the necessity of gratifying the insatiate avarice, which he had excited in the army.
 Of the several impositions introduced by Augustus, the <DATE>twentieth</DATE> on inheritances and legacies was the most fruitful, as well as the most comprehensive.
 As its influence was not confined to <GPE>Rome</GPE> or Italy, the produce continually increased with the gradual extension of the ROMAN CITY.
 The new citizens, though charged, on equal terms,(113) with the payment of new taxes, which had not affected them as subjects, derived an ample compensation from the rank they obtained, the privileges they acquired, and the fair prospect of honours The freedom of the city given to all the provincials for the purpose of taxation.
 and fortune that was thrown open to their ambition.
 But thefavour which implied a distinction, was lost in the prodigality of Caracalla, and the reluctant provincials were compelled to assume the vain title, and the real obligations, of <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens.
 Nor was the rapacious son of <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> contented with such a measure of taxation, as had appeared sufficient to his moderate predecessors.
 Instead of a twentieth, he exacted a tenth of all legacies and inheritances; and during his reign (for the ancient proportion was restored after his death) he crushed alike every part of the empire under the weight of his iron sceptre.
(114) Temporary reduction of tribute When all the provincials became liable to the peculiar impositions of <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens, they seemed to acquire a legal exemption from the tributes which they had paid in their former condition of subjects.
 Such were not the maxims of government adopted by <PERSON>Caracalla</PERSON> and his pretended son.
 The old as well as the new taxes were, at the same time, levied in the provinces.
 It was reserved for the virtue of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> to relieve them in a great measure from this intolerable grievance, by reducing the tributes to a thirtieth part of the sum exacted at the time of his accession.
 (115) It is impossible to conjecture the motive that engaged him to spare so trifling a remnant of the public evil, but the noxious weed, which had not been totally eradicated, again sprang up with the most luxuriant growth, and in the succeeding age darkened the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world with its deadly shade.
 In the course of this history, we shall be too often summoned to explain the land-tax, the capitation, and the heavy contributions of corn, wine, oily and meat, which were exacted from the provinces for the use of the court, the army, and the capital.
 Consequences of the universal freedom of <GPE>Rome</GPE> As long as <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> were respected as the centre of government, a national spirit was preserved by the ancient, and insensibly imbibed by the adopted, citizens.
 The principal commands of the army were filled by men who had received a liberal education, were well instructed in the advantages of laws and letters, and who had risen, by equal steps, through the regular succession of civil and military honours.
(116) To their influence and example we may partly ascribe the modest obedience of the legions during the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> centuries of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> history.
 But when the last enclosure of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> constitution was trampled down by Caracalla, the separation of professions gradually succeeded to the distinction of ranks.
 The more polished citizens of the internal provinces were alone qualified to act as lawyers and magistrates.
 The rougher trade of arms was abandoned to the peasants and barbarians of the frontiers, who knew no country but their camp, no science but that of war, no civil laws, and scarcely those of military discipline.
 With bloody hands, savage manners, and desperate resolutions, they sometimes guarded, but much oftener subverted, the throne of the emperors.
