Description of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> and Its Inhabitants.
 Birth, Character, and Doctrine of Mahomet.
 He Preaches at Mecca.
 Flies to Medina.
 Propagates His Religion by the Sword.

 His Death and Successors.
 The Claims and Fortunes of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> and His Descendants.
 After pursuing above <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years the fleeting <LOC>Caesars</LOC> of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Germany, I now descend, in the reign of Heraclius, on the eastern borders of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarchy.
 While the state was exhausted by the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war, and the church was distracted by the <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> and <NORP>Monophysite</NORP> sects, Mahomet, with the sword in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hand and the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> in the other, erected his throne on the ruins of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> and of Rome.
 The genius of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> prophet, the manners of his nation, and the spirit of his religion, involve the causes of the decline and fall of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire; and our eyes are curiously intent on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most memorable revolutions, which have impressed a new and lasting character on the nations of the globe.
 (1) Description of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> In the vacant space between Persia, Syria, Egypt, and Aethiopia, the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> peninsula (2) may be conceived as a triangle of spacious but irregular dimensions.
 From the northern point of <GPE>Beles</GPE> (3) on the Euphrates, a line of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles is terminated by the Straits of Bebelmandel and the land of frankincense.
 About <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> this length may be allowed for the middle breadth, from east to west, from <GPE>Bassora</GPE> to Suez, from the <NORP>Persian</NORP> Gulf to the Red Sea.
 (4) The sides of the triangle are gradually enlarged, and the southern basis presents a front of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> miles to the <NORP>Indian</NORP> Ocean.
 The entire surface of the peninsula exceeds in a fourfold proportion that of <GPE>Germany</GPE> or France; The soil and climate but the far greater part has been justly stigmatized with the epithets of the stony and the sandy.
 Even the wilds of <LOC>Tartary</LOC> are decked, by the hand of nature, with lofty trees and luxuriant herbage; and the lonesome traveller derives a sort of comfort and society from the presence of vegetable life.
 But in the dreary waste of Arabia, a boundless level of sand is intersected by sharp and naked mountains; and the face of the desert, without shade or shelter, is scorched by the direct and intense rays of a tropical sun.
 Instead of refreshing breezes, the winds, particularly from the south-west, diffuse a noxious and even deadly vapour; the hillocks of sand which they alternately raise and scatter, are compared to the billows of the ocean, and whole caravans, whole armies, have been lost and buried in the whirlwind.
 The common benefits of water are an object of desire and contest; and such is the scarcity of wood, that some art is requisite to preserve and propagate the element of fire.
 <GPE>Arabia</GPE> is destitute of navigable rivers, which fertilize the soil, and convey its produce to the adjacent regions: the torrents that fall from the hills are imbibed by the thirsty earth: the rare and hardy plants, the tamarind or the acacia, that strike their roots into the clefts of the rocks, are nourished by the dews of the night: a scanty supply of rain is collected in cisterns and aqueducts: the wells and springs are the secret treasure of the desert; and the pilgrim of Mecca, (5) after many a dry and sultry march, is disgusted by the taste of the waters which have rolled over a bed of sulphur or salt.
 Such is the general and genuine picture of the climate of Arabia.
 The experience of evil enhances the value of any local or partial enjoyments.
 A shady grove, a green pasture, a stream of fresh water, are sufficient to attract a colony of sedentary <NORP>Arabs</NORP> to the fortunate spots which can afford food and refreshment to themselves and their cattle, and which encourage their industry in the cultivation of the palmtree and the vine.
 The high lands that border on the <NORP>Indian</NORP> <LOC>Ocean</LOC> are distinguished by their superior plenty of wood and water; the air is more temperate, the fruits are more delicious, the animals and the human race more numerous: the fertility of the soil invites and rewards the toil of the husbandman; and the peculiar gifts of frankincense (6) and coffee have attracted in different ages the merchants of the world.
 If it be compared with the rest of the peninsula, this sequestered region may truly deserve the appellation of the happy; and the splendid coloring of fancy and fiction has been suggested by contrast, and countenanced by distance.
 It was for this earthly paradise that Nature had reserved her choicest favours and her most curious workmanship: the incompatible blessings of luxury and innocence were ascribed to the natives: the soil was impregnated with gold (7) and gems, and both the land and sea were taught to exhale the odours of aromatic sweets.
 Division of the sandy, the stony, and the happy, <GPE>Arabia</GPE> This division of the sandy, the stony, and the happy, so familiar to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, is unknown to the <NORP>Arabians</NORP> themselves; and it is singular enough, that a country, whose language and inhabitants have ever been the same, should scarcely retain a vestige of its ancient geography.
 The maritime districts of <GPE>Bahrein</GPE> and <GPE>Oman</GPE> are opposite to the realm of Persia.
 The kingdom of <GPE>Yemen</GPE> displays the limits, or at least the situation, of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> Felix: the name of <GPE>Neged</GPE> is extended over the inland space; and the birth of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> has illustrated the province of <GPE>Hejaz</GPE> along the coast of the Red Sea.
 (8) Manners of the Bedoweens, or pastoral Arabs.
 The measure of population is regulated by the means of subsistence; and the inhabitants of this vast peninsula might be outnumbered by the subjects of a fertile and industrious province.
 Along the shores of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> Gulf, of the ocean, and even of the Red Sea, the Icthyophagi, (9) or fish eaters, continued to wander in quest of their precarious food.
 In this primitive and abject state, which ill deserves the name of society, the human brute, without arts or laws, almost without sense or language, is poorly distinguished from the rest of the animal creation.
 Generations and ages might roll away in silent oblivion, and the helpless savage was restrained from multiplying his race by the wants and pursuits which confined his existence to the narrow margin of the seacoast.
 But in an early period of antiquity the great body of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> had emerged from this scene of misery; and as the naked wilderness could not maintain a people of hunters, they rose at once to the more secure and plentiful condition of the pastoral life.
 The same life is uniformly pursued by the roving tribes of the desert; and in the portrait of the modern Bedoweens, we may trace the features of their ancestors, (10) who, in the age of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> or Mahomet, dwelt under similar tents, and conducted their horses, and camels, and sheep, to the same springs and the same pastures.
 Our toil is lessened, and our wealth is increased, by our dominion over the useful animals; and the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> shepherd had acquired the absolute possession of a faithful friend and a laborious slave.
 (11) Arabia, in the opinion of the naturalist, is the genuine and original country of the horse; the climate most propitious, not indeed to the size, but to the spirit and swiftness, of that generous animal.
 The merit of the Barb, the Spanish, and the <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> breed, is derived from a mixture of <NORP>Arabian</NORP> blood: (12) the <NORP>Bedoweens</NORP> preserve, with superstitious care, the honours and the memory of the purest race: the males are sold at a high price, but the females are seldom alienated; and the birth of a noble foal was esteemed among the tribes, as a subject of joy and mutual congratulation.
 These horses are educated in the tents, among the children of the Arabs, with a tender familiarity, which trains them in the habits of gentleness and attachment.
 They are accustomed only to walk and to gallop: their sensations are not blunted by the incessant abuse of the spur and the whip: their powers are reserved for the moments of flight and pursuit: but no sooner do they feel the touch of the hand or the stirrup, than they dart away with the swiftness of the wind; and if their friend be dismounted in the rapid career, they instantly stop till he has recovered his seat.
 In the sands of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Arabia, the camel is a sacred and precious gift.
 That strong and patient beast of burden can perform, without eating or drinking, a journey of several days; and a reservoir of fresh water is preserved in a large bag, a <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> stomach of the animal, whose body is imprinted with the marks of servitude: the larger breed is capable of transporting a weight of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds; and the dromedary, of a lighter and more active frame, outstrips the fleetest courser in the race.
 Alive or dead, almost every part of the camel is serviceable to man: her milk is plentiful and nutritious: the young and tender flesh has the taste of veal: (13) a valuable salt is extracted from the urine: the dung supplies the deficiency of fuel; and the long hair, which falls each year and is renewed, is coarsely manufactured into the garments, the furniture, and the tents of the Bedoweens.
 In the rainy seasons, they consume the rare and insufficient herbage of the desert: during the heats of summer and the scarcity of winter, they remove their encampments to the sea-coast, the hills of Yemen, or the neighbourhood of the Euphrates, and have often extorted the dangerous license of visiting the banks of the Nile, and the villages of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Palestine.
 The life of a wandering <NORP>Arab</NORP> is a life of danger and distress; and though sometimes, by rapine or exchange, he may appropriate the fruits of industry, a private citizen in <LOC>Europe</LOC> is in the possession of more solid and pleasing luxury than the proudest emir, who marches in the field at the head of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse.
 Cities of Arabia: Yet an essential difference may be found between the hordes of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> and the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> tribes; since many of the latter were collected into towns, and employed in the labours of trade and agriculture.
 A part of their time and industry was still devoted to the management of their cattle: they mingled, in peace and war, with their brethren of the desert; and the <NORP>Bedoweens</NORP> derived from their useful intercourse some supply of their wants, and some rudiments of art and knowledge.
 Among the <CARDINAL>forty-two</CARDINAL> cities of Arabia, (14) enumerated by Abulfeda, the most ancient and populous were situate in the happy Yemen: the towers of Saana, (15) and the marvellous reservoir of Merab, (16) were constructed by the kings of the Homerites; but their profane lustre was eclipsed by the prophetic glories of MEDINA (17) and MECCA, (18) near the Red Sea, and at the distance from each other of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> miles.
 The last of these holy places was known to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> under the name of Macoraba; and the termination of the word is expressive of its greatness, which has not, indeed, in the most flourishing period, exceeded the size and populousness of Marseilles.
 Some latent motive, perhaps of superstition, must have impelled the founders, in the choice of a most unpromising situation.
 They erected their habitations of mud or stone, in a plain about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles long and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile broad, at the foot of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> barren mountains: the soil is a rock; the water even of the holy well of <PERSON>Zemzem</PERSON> is bitter or brackish; the pastures are remote from the city; and grapes are transported above <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> miles from the gardens of Tayef.
 The fame and spirit of the Koreishites, who reigned in Mecca, were conspicuous among the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> tribes; but their ungrateful soil refused the labours of agriculture, and their position was favourable to the enterprises of trade.
 Her trade.
 By the seaport of Gedda, at the distance only of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> miles, they maintained an easy correspondence with Abyssinia; and that <NORP>Christian</NORP> kingdom afforded the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> refuge to the disciples of Mahomet.
 The treasures of <LOC>Africa</LOC> were conveyed over the <LOC>Peninsula</LOC> to <LOC>Gerrha</LOC> or Katif, in the province of Bahrein, a city built, as it is said, of rock-salt, by the <NORP>Chaldaean</NORP> exiles; (19) and from thence with the native pearls of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> Gulf, they were floated on rafts to the mouth of the Euphrates.
 <GPE>Mecca</GPE> is placed almost at an equal distance, a month's journey, between <GPE>Yemen</GPE> on the right, and <GPE>Syria</GPE> on the left hand.
 The former was the winter, the latter the summer, station of her caravans; and their seasonable arrival relieved the ships of <GPE>India</GPE> from the tedious and troublesome navigation of the Red Sea.
 In the markets of <GPE>Saana</GPE> and Merab, in the harbours of <GPE>Oman</GPE> and Aden, the camels of the <NORP>Koreishites</NORP> were laden with a precious cargo of aromatics; a supply of corn and manufactures was purchased in the fairs of <GPE>Bostra</GPE> and Damascus; the lucrative exchange diffused plenty and riches in the streets of Mecca; and the noblest of her sons united the love of arms with the profession of merchandise.
 (20) National independence of the Arabs.
 The perpetual independence of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> has been the theme of praise among strangers and natives; and the arts of controversy transform this singular event into a prophecy and a miracle, in favour of the posterity of Ismael.
 (21) Some exceptions, that can neither be dismissed nor eluded, render this mode of reasoning as indiscreet as it is superfluous; the kingdom of <GPE>Yemen</GPE> has been successively subdued by the Abyssinians, the Persians, the sultans of Egypt, (22) and the Turks; (23) the holy cities of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> and <GPE>Medina</GPE> have repeatedly bowed under a <NORP>Scythian</NORP> tyrant; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> province of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> (24) embraced the peculiar wilderness in which <PERSON>Ismael</PERSON> and his sons must have pitched their tents in the face of their brethren.
 Yet these exceptions are temporary or local; the body of the nation has escaped the yoke of the most powerful monarchies: the arms of <PERSON>Sesostris</PERSON> and Cyrus, of <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> and Trajan, could never achieve the conquest of Arabia; the present sovereign of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> (25) may exercise a shadow of jurisdiction, but his pride is reduced to solicit the friendship of a people, whom it is dangerous to provoke, and fruitless to attack.
 The obvious causes of their freedom are inscribed on the character and country of the Arabs.
 Many ages before Mahomet, (26) their intrepid valour had been severely felt by their neighbours in offensive and defensive war.
 The patient and active virtues of a soldier are insensibly nursed in the habits and discipline of a pastoral life.
 The care of the sheep and camels is abandoned to the women of the tribe; but the martial youth, under the banner of the emir, is ever on horseback, and in the field, to practise the exercise of the bow, the javelin, and the cimeter.
 The long memory of their independence is the firmest pledge of its perpetuity and succeeding generations are animated to prove their descent, and to maintain their inheritance.
 Their domestic feuds are suspended on the approach of a common enemy; and in their last hostilities against the Turks, the caravan of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> was attacked and pillaged by fourscore <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the confederates.
 When they advance to battle, the hope of victory is in the front; in the rear, the assurance of a retreat.
 Their horses and camels, who, in <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days, can perform a march of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> miles, disappear before the conqueror; the secret waters of the desert elude his search, and his victorious troops are consumed with thirst, hunger, and fatigue, in the pursuit of an invisible foe, who scorns his efforts, and safely reposes in the heart of the burning solitude.
 The arms and deserts of the <NORP>Bedoweens</NORP> are not only the safeguards of their own freedom, but the barriers also of the happy Arabia, whose inhabitants, remote from war, are enervated by the luxury of the soil and climate.
 The legions of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> melted away in disease and lassitude; (27) and it is only by a naval power that the reduction of <GPE>Yemen</GPE> has been successfully attempted.
 When <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> erected his holy standard, (28) that kingdom was a province of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> empire; yet <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> princes of the <PERSON>Homerites</PERSON> still reigned in the mountains; and the vicegerent of <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was tempted to forget his distant country and his unfortunate master.
 The historians of the age of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> represent the state of the independent Arabs, who were divided by interest or affection in the long quarrel of the East: the tribe of <PERSON>Gassan</PERSON> was allowed to encamp on the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> territory: the princes of <NORP>Hira</NORP> were permitted to form a city about <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> miles to the southward of the ruins of Babylon.
 Their service in the field was speedy and vigorous; but their friendship was venal, their faith inconstant, their enmity capricious: it was an easier task to excite than to disarm these roving barbarians; and, in the familiar intercourse of war, they learned to see, and to despise, the splendid weakness both of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of Persia.
 From <GPE>Mecca</GPE> to the Euphrates, the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> tribes (29) were confounded by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins, under the general appellation of SARACENS, (30) a name which every <NORP>Christian</NORP> mouth has been taught to pronounce with terror and abhorrence.
 Their domestic freedom and character.
 The slaves of domestic tyranny may vainly exult in their national independence: but the <NORP>Arab</NORP> is personally free; and he enjoys, in some degree, the benefits of society, without forfeiting the prerogatives of nature.
 In every tribe, superstition, or gratitude, or fortune, has exalted a particular family above the heads of their equals.
 The dignities of sheick and emir invariably descend in this chosen race; but the order of succession is loose and precarious; and the most worthy or aged of the noble kinsmen are preferred to the simple, though important, office of composing disputes by their advice, and guiding valour by their example.
 Even a female of sense and spirit has been permitted to command the countrymen of Zenobia.
 (31) The momentary junction of several tribes produces an army: their more lasting union constitutes a nation; and the supreme chief, the emir of emirs, whose banner is displayed at their head, may deserve, in the eyes of strangers, the honours of the kingly name.
 If the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> princes abuse their power, they are quickly punished by the desertion of their subjects, who had been accustomed to a mild and parental jurisdiction.
 Their spirit is free, their steps are unconfined, the desert is open, and the tribes and families are held together by a mutual and voluntary compact.
 The softer natives of <GPE>Yemen</GPE> supported the pomp and majesty of a monarch; but if he could not leave his palace without endangering his life, (32) the active powers of government must have been devolved on his nobles and magistrates.
 The cities of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> and <GPE>Medina</GPE> present, in the heart of Asia, the form, or rather the substance, of a commonwealth.
 The grandfather of Mahomet, and his lineal ancestors, appear in foreign and domestic transactions as the princes of their country; but they reigned, like <PERSON>Pericles</PERSON> at Athens, or the <PERSON>Medici</PERSON> at Florence, by the opinion of their wisdom and integrity; their influence was divided with their patrimony; and the sceptre was transferred from the uncles of the prophet to a younger branch of the tribe of Koreish.
 On solemn occasions they convened the assembly of the people; and, since mankind must be either compelled or persuaded to obey, the use and reputation of oratory among the ancient <NORP>Arabs</NORP> is the clearest evidence of public freedom.
 (33) But their simple freedom was of a very different cast from the nice and artificial machinery of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> and <NORP>Roman</NORP> republics, in which each member possessed an undivided share of the civil and political rights of the community.
 In the more simple state of the Arabs, the nation is free, because each of her sons disdains a base submission to the will of a master.
 His breast is fortified by the austere virtues of courage, patience, and sobriety; the love of independence prompts him to exercise the habits of self-command; and the fear of dishonour guards him from the meaner apprehension of pain, of danger, and of death.
 The gravity and firmness of the mind is conspicuous in his outward demeanour; his speech is low, weighty, and concise; he is seldom provoked to laughter; his only gesture is that of stroking his beard, the venerable symbol of manhood; and the sense of his own importance teaches him to accost his equals without levity, and his superiors without awe.
 (34) The liberty of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> survived their conquests: the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> caliphs indulged the bold and familiar language of their subjects; they ascended the pulpit to persuade and edify the congregation; nor was it before the seat of empire was removed to the Tigris, that the <NORP>Abbasides</NORP> adopted the proud and pompous ceremonial of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> and <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> courts.
 Civil wars and private revenge.
 In the study of nations and men, we may observe the causes that render them hostile or friendly to each other, that tend to narrow or enlarge, to mollify or exasperate, the social character.
 The separation of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> from the rest of mankind has accustomed them to confound the ideas of stranger and enemy; and the poverty of the land has introduced a maxim of jurisprudence, which they believe and practise to the present hour.
 They pretend, that, in the division of the earth, the rich and fertile climates were assigned to the other branches of the human family; and that the posterity of the outlaw <PERSON>Ismael</PERSON> might recover, by fraud or force, the portion of inheritance of which he had been unjustly deprived.
 According to the remark of Pliny, the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> tribes are equally addicted to theft and merchandise; the caravans that traverse the desert are ransomed or pillaged; and their neighbours, since the remote times of <WORK_OF_ART>Job</WORK_OF_ART> and Sesostris, (35) have been the victims of their rapacious spirit.
 If a <NORP>Bedoween</NORP> discovers from afar a solitary traveller, he rides furiously against him, crying, with a loud voice, "Undress thyself, thy aunt (my wife) is without a garment.
" A ready submission entitles him to mercy; resistance will provoke the aggressor, and his own blood must expiate the blood which he presumes to shed in legitimate defence.
 A single robber, or a few associates, are branded with their genuine name; but the exploits of a numerous band assume the character of lawful and honourable war.
 The temper of a people thus armed against mankind was doubly inflamed by the domestic license of rapine, murder, and revenge.
 In the constitution of Europe, the right of peace and war is now confined to a small, and the actual exercise to a much smaller, list of respectable potentates; but each Arab, with impunity and renown, might point his javelin against the life of his countrymen.
 The union of the nation consisted only in a vague resemblance of language and manners; and in each community, the jurisdiction of the magistrate was mute and impotent.
 Of the time of ignorance which preceded Mahomet, <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> battles (36) are recorded by tradition: hostility was embittered with the rancour of civil faction; and the recital, in prose or verse, of an obsolete feud, was sufficient to rekindle the same passions among the descendants of the hostile tribes.
 In private life every man, at least every family, was the judge and avenger of his own cause.
 The nice sensibility of honour, which weighs the insult rather than the injury, sheds its deadly venom on the quarrels of the Arabs: the honour of their women, and of their beards, is most easily wounded; an indecent action, a contemptuous word, can be expiated only by the blood of the offender; and such is their patient inveteracy, that they expect whole <DATE>months</DATE> and years the opportunity of revenge.
 A fine or compensation for murder is familiar to the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of every age: but in <GPE>Arabia</GPE> the kinsmen of the dead are at liberty to accept the atonement, or to exercise with their own hands the law of retaliation.
 The refined malice of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> refuses even the head of the murderer, substitutes an innocent for the guilty person, and transfers the penalty to the best and most considerable of the race by whom they have been injured.
 If he falls by their hands, they are exposed, in their turn, to the danger of reprisals, the interest and principal of the bloody debt are accumulated: the individuals of either family lead a life of malice and suspicion, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years may sometimes elapse before the account of vengeance be finally settled.
 (37) This sanguinary spirit, ignorant of pity or forgiveness, has been moderated, however, by the maxims of honour, which require in every private encounter some decent equality of age and strength, of numbers and weapons.
 <DATE>Annual</DATE> truce An <DATE>annual</DATE> festival of two, perhaps of four, months, was observed by the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> before the time of Mahomet, during which their swords were religiously sheathed both in foreign and domestic hostility; and this partial truce is more strongly expressive of the habits of anarchy and warfare.
 (38) Their social qualifications and virtues.
 But the spirit of rapine and revenge was attempered by the milder influence of trade and literature.
 The solitary peninsula is encompassed by the most civilized nations of the ancient world; the merchant is the friend of mankind; and the <DATE>annual</DATE> caravans imported the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> seeds of knowledge and politeness into the cities, and even the camps of the desert.
 Whatever may be the pedigree of the Arabs, their language is derived from the same original stock with the Hebrew, the Syriac, and the <NORP>Chaldaean</NORP> tongues; the independence of the tribes was marked by their peculiar dialects; (39) but each, after their own, allowed a just preference to the pure and perspicuous idiom of Mecca.
 In Arabia, as well as in Greece, the perfection of language outstripped the refinement of manners; and her speech could diversify the fourscore names of honey, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of a serpent, the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of a lion, the <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of a sword, at a time when this copious dictionary was entrusted to the memory of an illiterate people.
 The monuments of the <PERSON>Homerites</PERSON> were inscribed with an obsolete and mysterious character; but the <PERSON>Cufic</PERSON> letters, the groundwork of the present alphabet, were invented on the banks of the Euphrates; and the recent invention was taught at <GPE>Mecca</GPE> by a stranger who settled in that city after the birth of Mahomet.
 The arts of grammar, of metre, and of rhetoric, were unknown to the freeborn eloquence of the Arabians; but their penetration was sharp, their fancy luxuriant, their wit strong and sententious, (40) and their more elaborate compositions were addressed with energy and effect to the minds of their hearers.
 Love of poetry The genius and merit of a rising poet was celebrated by the applause of his own and the kindred tribes.
 A solemn banquet was prepared, and a chorus of women, striking their tymbals, and displaying the pomp of their nuptials, sung in the presence of their sons and husbands the felicity of their native tribe; that a champion had now appeared to vindicate their rights; that a herald had raised his voice to immortalize their renown.
 The distant or hostile tribes resorted to an <DATE>annual</DATE> fair, which was abolished by the fanaticism of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Moslems; a national assembly that must have contributed to refine and harmonize the Barbarians.
 Thirty days were employed in the exchange, not only of corn and wine, but of eloquence and poetry.
 The prize was disputed by the generous emulation of the bards; the victorious performance was deposited in the archives of princes and emirs; and we may read in our own language, the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> original poems which were inscribed in letters of gold, and suspended in the temple of Mecca.
 (41) The <NORP>Arabian</NORP> poets were the historians and moralists of the age; and if they sympathized with the prejudices, they inspired and crowned the virtues, of their countrymen.
 The indissoluble union of generosity and valour was the darling theme of their song; and when they pointed their keenest satire against a despicable race, they affirmed, in the bitterness of reproach, that the men knew not how to give, nor the women to deny.
 (42) Examples of generosity The same hospitality, which was practised by Abraham, and celebrated by Homer, is still renewed in the camps of the Arabs.
 The ferocious Bedoweens, the terror of the desert, embrace, without inquiry or hesitation, the stranger who dares to confide in their honour and to enter their tent.
 His treatment is kind and respectful: he shares the wealth, or the poverty, of his host; and, after a needful repose, he is dismissed on his way, with thanks, with blessings, and perhaps with gifts.
 The heart and hand are more largely expanded by the wants of a brother or a friend; but the heroic acts that could deserve the public applause, must have surpassed the narrow measure of discretion and experience.
 A dispute had arisen, who, among the citizens of Mecca, was entitled to the prize of generosity; and a successive application was made to the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> who were deemed most worthy of the trial.
 Abdallah, the son of Abbas, had undertaken a distant journey, and his foot was in the stirrup when he heard the voice of a suppliant, He instantly dismounted to present the pilgrim with his camel, her rich caparison, and a purse of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pieces of gold, excepting only the sword, either for its intrinsic value, or as the gift of an honoured kinsman.
 The servant of <PERSON>Kais</PERSON> informed the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> suppliant that his master was asleep: but he immediately added, the master, as soon as he awoke, praised and enfranchised his faithful steward, with a gentle reproof, that by respecting his slumbers he had stinted his bounty.
 The <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of these heroes, the blind Arabah, at the hour of prayer, was supporting his steps on the shoulders of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> slaves.
 At these words, pushing away the youths, he groped along the wall with his staff.
 The character of <PERSON>Hatem</PERSON> is the perfect model of <NORP>Arabian</NORP> virtue: (43) he was brave and liberal, an eloquent poet, and a successful robber; <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> camels were roasted at his hospitable feast; and at the prayer of a suppliant enemy he restored both the captives and the spoil.
 The freedom of his countrymen disdained the laws of justice; they proudly indulged the spontaneous impulse of pity and benevolence.
 Ancient idolatry The religion of the Arabs, (44) as well as of the Indians, consisted in the worship of the sun, the moon, and the fixed stars; a primitive and specious mode of superstition.
 The bright luminaries of the sky display the visible image of a Deity: their number and distance convey to a philosophic, or even a vulgar, eye, the idea of boundless space: the character of eternity is marked on these solid globes, that seem incapable of corruption or decay: the regularity of their motions may be ascribed to a principle of reason or instinct; and their real, or imaginary, influence encourages the vain belief that the earth and its inhabitants are the object of their peculiar care.
 The science of astronomy was cultivated at Babylon; but the school of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> was a clear firmament and a naked plain.
 In their nocturnal marches, they steered by the guidance of the stars: their names, and order, and daily station, were familiar to the curiosity and devotion of the Bedoween; and he was taught by experience to divide, in <CARDINAL>twenty-eight</CARDINAL> parts, the zodiac of the moon, and to bless the constellations who refreshed, with salutary rains, the thirst of the desert.
 The reign of the heavenly orbs could not be extended beyond the visible sphere; and some metaphysical powers were necessary to sustain the transmigration of souls and the resurrection of bodies: a camel was left to perish on the grave, that he might serve his master in another life; and the invocation of departed spirits implies that they were still endowed with consciousness and power.
 I am ignorant, and I am careless, of the blind mythology of the Barbarians; of the local deities, of the stars, the air, and the earth, of their sex or titles, their attributes or subordination.
 Each tribe, each family, each independent warrior, created and changed the rites and the object of his fantastic worship; but the nation, in every age, has bowed to the religion, as well as to the language, of Mecca.
 The Caaba, or temple of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> The genuine antiquity of the <WORK_OF_ART>CAABA</WORK_OF_ART> ascends beyond the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era; in describing the coast of the Red Sea, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> historian <PERSON>Diodorus</PERSON> (45) has remarked, between the <NORP>Thamudites</NORP> and the Sabaeans, a famous temple, whose superior sanctity was revered by all the Arabians; the linen or silken veil, which is annually renewed by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> emperor, was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> offered by a pious king of the Homerites, who reigned <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years before the time of Mahomet.
 (46) A tent, or a cavern, might suffice for the worship of the savages, but an edifice of stone and clay has been erected in its place; and the art and power of the monarchs of the <LOC>East</LOC> have been confined to the simplicity of the original model.
 (47) A spacious portico encloses the quadrangle of the Caaba; a square chapel, <CARDINAL>twenty-four</CARDINAL> cubits long, <CARDINAL>twenty-three</CARDINAL> broad, and <CARDINAL>twenty-seven</CARDINAL> high: a door and a window admit the light; the double roof is supported by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> pillars of wood; a spout (now of gold) discharges the rain-water, and the well <GPE>Zemzen</GPE> is protected by a dome from accidental pollution.
 The tribe of Koreish, by fraud and force, had acquired the custody of the Caaba: the sacerdotal office devolved through <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> lineal descents to the grandfather of Mahomet; and the family of the Hashemites, from whence he sprung, was the most respectable and sacred in the eyes of their country.
 (48) The precincts of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> enjoyed the rights of sanctuary; and, in the last <DATE>month</DATE> of each year, the city and the temple were crowded with a long train of pilgrims, who presented their vows and offerings in the house of God.
 The same rites which are now accomplished by the faithful Mussulman, were invented and practised by the superstition of the idolaters.
 At an awful distance they cast away their garments: <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> times, with hasty steps, they encircled the Caaba, and kissed the black stone: <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> times they visited and adored the adjacent mountains; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> times they threw stones into the valley of Mina; and the pilgrimage was achieved, as at the present hour, by a sacrifice of sheep and camels, and the burial of their hair and nails in the consecrated ground.
 Each tribe either found or introduced in the <NORP>Caaba</NORP> their domestic worship: the temple was adorned, or defiled, with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty idols of men, eagles, lions, and antelopes; and most conspicuous was the statue of Hebal, of red agate, holding in his hand <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> arrows, without heads or feathers, the instruments and symbols of profane divination.
 But this statue was a monument of <NORP>Syrian</NORP> arts: the devotion of the ruder ages was content with a pillar or a tablet; and the rocks of the desert were hewn into gods or altars, in imitation of the black stone (49) of Mecca, Sacrifices and rites.
 which is deeply tainted with the reproach of an idolatrous origin.
 From <GPE>Japan</GPE> to Peru, the use of sacrifice has universally prevailed; and the votary has expressed his gratitude, or fear, by destroying or consuming, in honour of the gods, the dearest and most precious of their gifts.
 The life of a man (50) is the most precious oblation to deprecate a public calamity: the altars of <GPE>Phoenicia</GPE> and Egypt, of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Carthage, have been polluted with human gore: the cruel practice was long preserved among the Arabs; in the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> century, a boy was annually sacrificed by the tribe of the Dumatians; (51) and a royal captive was piously slaughtered by the prince of the Saracens, the ally and soldier of the emperor Justinian.
 (52) A parent who drags his son to the altar, exhibits the most painful and sublime effort of fanaticism: the deed, or the intention, was sanctified by the example of saints and heroes; and the father of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> himself was devoted by a rash vow, and hardly ransomed for the equivalent of a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> camels.
 In the time of ignorance, the Arabs, like the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and Egyptians, abstained from the taste of swine's flesh; (53) they circumcised (54) their children at the age of puberty: the same customs, without the censure or the precept of the Koran, have been silently transmitted to their posterity and proselytes.
 It has been sagaciously conjectured, that the artful legislator indulged the stubborn prejudices of his countrymen.
 It is more simple to believe that he adhered to the habits and opinions of his youth, without foreseeing that a practice congenial to the climate of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> might become useless or inconvenient on the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> or the Volga.
 Introduction of the Sabians.
 <GPE>Arabia</GPE> was free: the adjacent kingdoms were shaken by the storms of conquest and tyranny, and the persecuted sects fled to the happy land where they might profess what they thought, and practise what they professed.
 The religions of the <NORP>Sabians</NORP> and Magians, of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and Christians, were disseminated from the <NORP>Persian</NORP> Gulf to the Red Sea.
 In a remote period of antiquity, Sabianism was diffused over <LOC>Asia</LOC> by the science of the <PERSON>Chaldaeans</PERSON> (55) and the arms of the Assyrians.
 From the observations of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years, the priests and astronomers of <GPE>Babylon</GPE> (56) deduced the eternal laws of nature and providence.
 They adored the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> gods or angels, who directed the course of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> planets, and shed their irresistible influence on the earth.
 The attributes of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> planets, with the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> signs of the zodiac, and the <CARDINAL>twenty-four</CARDINAL> constellations of the northern and southern hemisphere, were represented by images and talismans; the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> days of the week were dedicated to their respective deities; the <NORP>Sabians</NORP> prayed thrice each day; and the temple of the moon at <GPE>Haran</GPE> was the term of their pilgrimage.
 (57) But the flexible genius of their faith was always ready either to teach or to learn: in the tradition of the creation, the deluge, and the patriarchs, they held a singular agreement with their <NORP>Jewish</NORP> captives; they appealed to the secret books of Adam, Seth, and Enoch; and a slight infusion of the gospel has transformed the last remnant of the <NORP>Polytheists</NORP> into the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of St.
 John, in the territory of Bassora.
 (58) The altars of <GPE>Babylon</GPE> were overturned by The <NORP>Magians</NORP> the Magians; but the injuries of the <NORP>Sabians</NORP> were revenged by the sword of Alexander; <GPE>Persia</GPE> groaned above <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years under a foreign yoke; and the purest disciples of <PERSON>Zoroaster</PERSON> escaped from the contagion of idolatry, and breathed with their adversaries the freedom of the desert.
 (59) Seven <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years before the death of Mahomet, The <NORP>Jews</NORP> the <NORP>Jews</NORP> were settled in Arabia; and a far greater multitude was expelled from the Holy Land in the wars of <PERSON>Titus</PERSON> and Hadrian.
 The industrious exiles aspired to liberty and power: they erected synagogues in the cities, and castles in the wilderness, and their <NORP>Gentile</NORP> converts were confounded with the children of Israel, whom they resembled in the outward mark of circumcision.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> The <NORP>Christian</NORP> missionaries were still more active and successful: the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> asserted their universal reign; the sects whom they oppressed, successively retired beyond the limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire; the <NORP>Marcionites</NORP> and <NORP>Manichaeans</NORP> dispersed their fantastic opinions and apocryphal gospels; the churches of Yemen, and the princes of <NORP>Hira</NORP> and Gassan, were instructed in a purer creed by the <NORP>Jacobite</NORP> and <NORP>Nestorian</NORP> bishops.
 (60) The liberty of choice was presented to the tribes: each <NORP>Arab</NORP> was free to elect or to compose his private religion: and the rude superstition of his house was mingled with the sublime theology of saints and philosophers.
 A fundamental article of faith was inculcated by the consent of the learned strangers; the existence of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> supreme God who is exalted above the powers of heaven and earth, but who has often revealed himself to mankind by the ministry of his angels and prophets, and whose grace or justice has interrupted, by seasonable miracles, the order of nature.
 The most rational of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> acknowledged his power, though they neglected his worship; (61) and it was habit rather than conviction that still attached them to the relics of idolatry.
 The <NORP>Jews</NORP> and <NORP>Christians</NORP> were the people of the Book; the <WORK_OF_ART>Bible</WORK_OF_ART> was already translated into the <LANGUAGE>Arabic</LANGUAGE> language, (62) and the volume of the Old Testament was accepted by the concord of these implacable enemies.
 In the story of the <NORP>Hebrew</NORP> patriarchs, the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> were pleased to discover the fathers of their nation.
 They applauded the birth and promises of Ismael; revered the faith and virtue of Abraham; traced his pedigree and their own to the creation of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> man, and imbibed, with equal credulity, the prodigies of the holy text, and the dreams and traditions of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> rabbis.
 Birth and education of Mahomet, A.
D.
 569-609.
 The base and plebeian origin of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> is an unskilful calumny of the Christians, (63) who exalt instead of degrading the merit of their adversary.
 His descent from <PERSON>Ismael</PERSON> was a national privilege or fable; but if the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps of the pedigree (64) are dark and doubtful, he could produce many generations of pure and genuine nobility: he sprung from the tribe of <NORP>Koreish</NORP> and the family of Hashem, the most illustrious of the Arabs, the princes of Mecca, and the hereditary guardians of the Caaba.
 The grandfather of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was Abdol Motalleb, the son of Hashem, a wealthy and generous citizen, who relieved the distress of famine with the supplies of commerce.
 Mecca, which had been fed by the liberality of the father, was saved by the courage of the son.
 The kingdom of <GPE>Yemen</GPE> was subject to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes of Abyssinia; their vassal <PERSON>Abrahah</PERSON> was provoked by an insult to avenge the honour of the cross; and the holy city was invested by a train of elephants and an army of Africans.
 A treaty was proposed; and, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> audience, the grandfather of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> demanded the restitution of his cattle.
 The want of provisions, or the valour of the Koreish, compelled the <NORP>Abyssinians</NORP> to a disgraceful retreat: their discomfiture has been adorned with a miraculous flight of birds, who showered down stones on the heads of the infidels; Deliverance of Mecca.
 and the deliverance was long commemorated by the era of the elephant.
 (65) The glory of Abdol Motalleb was crowned with domestic happiness; his life was prolonged to the age of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years; and he became the father of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> daughters and <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> sons.
 His best beloved <PERSON>Abdallah</PERSON> was the most beautiful and modest of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> youth; and in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> night, when he consummated his marriage with Amina, of the noble race of the Zahrites, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> virgins are said to have expired of jealousy and despair.
 Mahomet, or more properly Mohammed, the only son of <PERSON>Abdallah</PERSON> and Amina, was born at Mecca, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years after the death of Justinian, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <DATE>months</DATE> after the defeat of the Abyssinians, (66) whose victory would have introduced into the <NORP>Caaba</NORP> the religion of the Christians.
 In his early infancy, he was deprived of his father, his mother, and his grandfather; his uncles were strong and numerous; and, in the division of the inheritance, the orphan's share was reduced to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> camels and an <NORP>Aethiopian</NORP> maid-servant.
 At home and abroad, in peace and war, Abu Taleb, the most respectable of his uncles, was the guide and guardian of his youth; in his twenty-fifth year, he entered into the service of Cadijah, a rich and noble widow of Mecca, who soon rewarded his fidelity with the gift of her hand and fortune.
 The marriage contract, in the simple style of antiquity, recites the mutual love of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> and Cadijah; describes him as the most accomplished of the tribe of Koreish; and stipulates a dowry of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> ounces of gold and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> camels, which was supplied by the liberality of his uncle.
 (67) By this alliance, the son of <PERSON>Abdallah</PERSON> was restored to the station of his ancestors; and the judicious matron was content with his domestic virtues, till, in the fortieth year of his age, (68) he assumed the title of a prophet, and proclaimed the religion of the Koran.
 Qualifications of the prophet.
 According to the tradition of his companions, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> (69) was distinguished by the beauty of his person, an outward gift which is seldom despised, except by those to whom it has been refused.
 Before he spoke, the orator engaged on his side the affections of a public or private audience.
 They applauded his commanding presence, his majestic aspect, his piercing eye, his gracious smile, his flowing beard, his countenance that painted every sensation of the soul, and his gestures that enforced each expression of the tongue.
 In the familiar offices of life he scrupulously adhered to the grave and ceremonious politeness of his country: his respectful attention to the rich and powerful was dignified by his condescension and affability to the poorest citizens of Mecca: the frankness of his manner concealed the artifice of his views; and the habits of courtesy were imputed to personal friendship or universal benevolence.
 His memory was capacious and retentive; his wit easy and social; his imagination sublime; his judgment clear, rapid, and decisive.
 He possessed the courage both of thought and action; and, although his designs might gradually expand with his success, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> idea which he entertained of his divine mission bears the stamp of an original and superior genius.
 The son of <PERSON>Abdallah</PERSON> was educated in the bosom of the noblest race, in the use of the purest dialect of Arabia; and the fluency of his speech was corrected and enhanced by the practice of discreet and seasonable silence.
 With these powers of eloquence, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was an illiterate Barbarian: his youth had never been instructed in the arts of reading and writing; (70) the common ignorance exempted him from shame or reproach, but he was reduced to a narrow circle of existence, and deprived of those faithful mirrors, which reflect to our mind the minds of sages and heroes.
 Yet the book of nature and of man was open to his view; and some fancy has been indulged in the political and philosophical observations which are ascribed to the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> traveller.
 (71) He compares the nations and the regions of the earth; discovers the weakness of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> and <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarchies; beholds, with pity and indignation, the degeneracy of the times; and resolves to unite under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> God and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> king the invincible spirit and primitive virtues of the Arabs.
 Our more accurate inquiry will suggest, that, instead of visiting the courts, the camps, the temples, of the East, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> journeys of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> into <GPE>Syria</GPE> were confined to the fairs of <GPE>Bostra</GPE> and Damascus; that he was only <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> years of age when he accompanied the caravan of his uncle; and that his duty compelled him to return as soon as he had disposed of the merchandise of Cadijah.
 In these hasty and superficial excursions, the eye of genius might discern some objects invisible to his grosser companions; some seeds of knowledge might be cast upon a fruitful soil; but his ignorance of the <LANGUAGE>Syriac</LANGUAGE> language must have checked his curiosity; and I cannot perceive, in the life or writings of Mahomet, that his prospect was far extended beyond the limits of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> world.
 From every region of that solitary world, the pilgrims of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> were annually assembled, by the calls of devotion and commerce: in the free concourse of multitudes, a simple citizen, in his native tongue, might study the political state and character of the tribes, the theory and practice of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and Christians.
 Some useful strangers might be tempted, or forced, to implore the rights of hospitality; and the enemies of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> have named the Jew, the Persian, and the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> monk, whom they accuse of lending their secret aid to the composition of the Koran.
 (72) Conversation enriches the understanding, but solitude is the school of genius; and the uniformity of a work denotes the hand of a single artist.
 From his earliest youth <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was addicted to religious contemplation; each year, during the <DATE>month</DATE> of Ramadan, he withdrew from the world, and from the arms of Cadijah: in the cave of Hera, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles from Mecca, (73) he consulted the spirit of fraud or enthusiasm, whose abode is not in the heavens, but in the mind of the prophet.
 The faith which, under the name of Islam, he preached to his family and nation, is compounded of an eternal truth, and a necessary fiction, THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD, AND THAT MAHOMET IS THE APOSTLE OF GOD.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> God.
 It is the boast of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> apologists, that while the learned nations of antiquity were deluded by the fables of polytheism, their simple ancestors of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> preserved the knowledge and worship of the true God.
 The moral attributes of Jehovah may not easily be reconciled with the standard of human virtue: his metaphysical qualities are darkly expressed; but each page of the <WORK_OF_ART>Pentateuch</WORK_OF_ART> and the Prophets is an evidence of his power: the unity of his name is inscribed on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> table of the law; and his sanctuary was never defiled by any visible image of the invisible essence.
 After the ruin of the temple, the faith of the <NORP>Hebrew</NORP> exiles was purified, fixed, and enlightened, by the spiritual devotion of the synagogue; and the authority of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> will not justify his perpetual reproach, that the <NORP>Jews</NORP> of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> or <GPE>Medina</GPE> adored <PERSON>Ezra</PERSON> as the son of God.
 (74) But the children of <GPE>Israel</GPE> had ceased to be a people; and the religions of the world were guilty, at least in the eyes of the prophet, of giving sons, or daughters, or companions, to the supreme God.
 In the rude idolatry of the Arabs, the crime is manifest and audacious: the <NORP>Sabians</NORP> are poorly excused by the preeminence of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> planet, or intelligence, in their celestial hierarchy; and in the <NORP>Magian</NORP> system the conflict of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principles betrays the imperfection of the conqueror.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> of the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> century had insensibly relapsed into a semblance of Paganism: their public and private vows were addressed to the relics and images that disgraced the temples of the East: the throne of the Almighty was darkened by a cloud of martyrs, and saints, and angels, the objects of popular veneration; and the <NORP>Collyridian</NORP> heretics, who flourished in the fruitful soil of Arabia, invested the Virgin <PERSON>Mary</PERSON> with the name and honours of a goddess.
 (75) The mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation appear to contradict the principle of the divine unity.
 In their obvious sense, they introduce <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> equal deities, and transform the man <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> into the substance of the Son of God: (76) an orthodox commentary will satisfy only a believing mind: intemperate curiosity and zeal had torn the veil of the sanctuary; and each of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> sects was eager to confess that all, except themselves, deserved the reproach of idolatry and polytheism.
 The creed of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> is free from suspicion or ambiguity; and the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> is a glorious testimony to the unity of God.
 The prophet of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> rejected the worship of idols and men, of stars and planets, on the rational principle that whatever rises must set, that whatever is born must die, that whatever is corruptible must decay and perish.
 (77) In the Author of the universe, his rational enthusiasm confessed and adored an infinite and eternal being, without form or place, without issue or similitude, present to our most secret thoughts, existing by the necessity of his own nature, and deriving from himself all moral and intellectual perfection.
 These sublime truths, thus announced in the language of the prophet, (78) are firmly held by his disciples, and defined with metaphysical precision by the interpreters of the Koran.
 A philosophic theist might subscribe the popular creed of the Mahometans; (79) a creed too sublime, perhaps, for our present faculties.
 What object remains for the fancy, or even the understanding, when we have abstracted from the unknown substance all ideas of time and space, of motion and matter, of sensation and reflection? The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> principle of reason and revolution was confirmed by the voice of Mahomet: his proselytes, from <GPE>India</GPE> to Morocco, are distinguished by the name of Unitarians; and the danger of idolatry has been prevented by the interdiction of images.
 The doctrine of eternal decrees and absolute predestination is strictly embraced by the Mahometans; and they struggle, with the common difficulties, how to reconcile the prescience of God with the freedom and responsibility of man; how to explain the permission of evil under the reign of infinite power and infinite goodness.
 Mahomet, the apostle of God, and the last of the prophets.
 The God of nature has written his existence on all his works, and his law in the heart of man.
 To restore the knowledge of the one, and the practice of the other, has been the real or pretended aim of the prophets of every age: the liberality of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> allowed to his predecessors the same credit which he claimed for himself; and the chain of inspiration was prolonged from the fall of <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> to the promulgation of the Koran.
 (80) During that period, some rays of prophetic light had been imparted to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>twenty-four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of the elect, discriminated by their respective measure of virtue and grace; <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> apostles were sent with a special commission to recall their country from idolatry and vice; <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> volumes have been dictated by the Holy Spirit; and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> legislators of transcendent brightness have announced to mankind the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> successive revelations of various rites, but of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> immutable religion.
 The authority and station of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Christ, and Mahomet, rise in just gradation above each other; but whosoever hates or rejects any <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the prophets is numbered with the infidels.
 The writings of the patriarchs were extant only in the apocryphal copies of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Syrians: (81) the conduct of <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> had not entitled him to the gratitude or respect of his children; <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> precepts of <PERSON>Noah</PERSON> were observed by an inferior and imperfect class of the proselytes of the synagogue; (82) and the memory of <PERSON>Abraham</PERSON> was obscurely revered by the <NORP>Sabians</NORP> in his native land of Chaldaea: of the myriads of prophets, <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> alone lived and reigned; and the remnant of the inspired writings was comprised in the books of the Old and the New Testament.
 The miraculous story of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> is consecrated and embellished in the Koran; (83) and the captive <NORP>Jews</NORP> enjoy the secret revenge of imposing their own belief on the nations whose recent creeds they deride.
 For the author of Christianity, the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> are taught by the prophet to entertain a high and mysterious reverence.
 (84) <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> The wonders of the genuine and apocryphal gospels (86) are profusely heaped on his head; and the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church has not disdained to borrow from the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> the immaculate conception (87) of his virgin mother.
 Yet <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> was a mere mortal; and, at the <DATE>day</DATE> of judgment, his testimony will serve to condemn both the Jews, who reject him as a prophet, and the Christians, who adore him as the Son of God.
 The malice of his enemies aspersed his reputation, and conspired against his life; but their intention only was guilty; a phantom or a criminal was substituted on the cross; and the innocent saint was translated to the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> heaven.
 (88) During <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years the gospel was the way of truth and salvation; but the <NORP>Christians</NORP> insensibly forgot both the laws and example of their founder; and <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was instructed by the <NORP>Gnostics</NORP> to accuse the church, as well as the synagogue, of corrupting the integrity of the sacred text.
 (89) The piety of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> rejoiced in the assurance of a future prophet, more illustrious than themselves: the evangelical promise of the Paraclete, or Holy Ghost, was prefigured in the name, and accomplished in the person, of Mahomet, (90) the greatest and the last of the apostles of God.
 The <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> The communication of ideas requires a similitude of thought and language: the discourse of a philosopher would vibrate without effect on the ear of a peasant; yet how minute is the distance of their understandings, if it be compared with the contact of an infinite and a finite mind, with the word of God expressed by the tongue or the pen of a mortal! The inspiration of the <NORP>Hebrew</NORP> prophets, of the apostles and evangelists of Christ, might not be incompatible with the exercise of their reason and memory; and the diversity of their genius is strongly marked in the style and composition of the books of the Old and New Testament.
 But <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was content with a character, more humble, yet more sublime, of a simple editor; the substance of the Koran, (91) according to himself or his disciples, is uncreated and eternal; subsisting in the essence of the Deity, and inscribed with a pen of light on the table of his everlasting decrees.
 A paper copy, in a volume of silk and gems, was brought down to the lowest heaven by the angel Gabriel, who, under the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> economy, had indeed been despatched on the most important errands; and this trusty messenger successively revealed the chapters and verses to the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> prophet.
 Instead of a perpetual and perfect measure of the divine will, the fragments of the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> were produced at the discretion of Mahomet; each revelation is suited to the emergencies of his policy or passion; and all contradiction is removed by the saving maxim, that any text of <WORK_OF_ART>Scripture</WORK_OF_ART> is abrogated or modified by any subsequent passage.
 The word of God, and of the apostle, was diligently recorded by his disciples on palm-leaves and the shoulder-bones of mutton; and the pages, without order or connection, were cast into a domestic chest, in the custody of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his wives.
 Two years after the death of Mahomet, the sacred volume was collected and published by his friend and successor Abubeker: the work was revised by the caliph Othman, in the thirtieth year of the Hegira; and the various editions of the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> assert the same miraculous privilege of a uniform and incorruptible text.
 In the spirit of enthusiasm or vanity, the prophet rests the truth of his mission on the merit of his book; audaciously challenges both men and angels to imitate the beauties of a single page; and presumes to assert that God alone could dictate this incomparable performance.
 (92) This argument is most powerfully addressed to a devout Arabian, whose mind is attuned to faith and rapture; whose ear is delighted by the music of sounds; and whose ignorance is incapable of comparing the productions of human genius.
 (93) The harmony and copiousness of style will not reach, in a version, the <NORP>European</NORP> infidel: he will peruse with impatience the endless incoherent rhapsody of fable, and precept, and declamation, which seldom excites a sentiment or an idea, which sometimes crawls in the dust, and is sometimes lost in the clouds.
 The divine attributes exalt the fancy of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> missionary; but his loftiest strains must yield to the sublime simplicity of the book of Job, composed in a remote age, in the same country, and in the same language.
 (94) If the composition of the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> exceed the faculties of a man to what superior intelligence should we ascribe the Iliad of Homer, or the <NORP>Philippics</NORP> of Demosthenes? In all religions, the life of the founder supplies the silence of his written revelation: the sayings of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> were so many lessons of truth; his actions so many examples of virtue; and the public and private memorials were preserved by his wives and companions.
 At the end of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, the Sonna, or oral law, was fixed and consecrated by the labours of Al Bochari, who discriminated <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and seventy-five genuine traditions, from a mass of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> reports, of a more doubtful or spurious character.
 Each <DATE>day</DATE> the pious author prayed in the temple of Mecca, and performed his ablutions with the water of Zemzem: the pages were successively deposited on the pulpit and the sepulchre of the apostle; and the work has been approved by the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> orthodox sects of the Sonnites.
 (95) Miracles The mission of the ancient prophets, of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and of <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> had been confirmed by many splendid prodigies; and <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was repeatedly urged, by the inhabitants of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> and Medina, to produce a similar evidence of his divine legation; to call down from heaven the angel or the volume of his revelation, to create a garden in the desert, or to kindle a conflagration in the unbelieving city.
 As often as he is pressed by the demands of the Koreish, he involves himself in the obscure boast of vision and prophecy, appeals to the internal proofs of his doctrine, and shields himself behind the providence of God, who refuses those signs and wonders that would depreciate the merit of faith, and aggravate the guilt of infidelity But the modest or angry tone of his apologies betrays his weakness and vexation; and these passages of scandal established, beyond suspicion, the integrity of the Koran.
 (96) The votaries of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> are more assured than himself of his miraculous gifts; and their confidence and credulity increase as they are farther removed from the time and place of his spiritual exploits.
 They believe or affirm that trees went forth to meet him; that he was saluted by stones; that water gushed from his fingers; that he fed the hungry, cured the sick, and raised the dead; that a beam groaned to him; that a camel complained to him; that a shoulder of mutton informed him of its being poisoned; and that both animate and inanimate nature were equally subject to the apostle of God.
 (97) His dream of a nocturnal journey is seriously described as a real and corporeal transaction.
 A mysterious animal, the Borak, conveyed him from the temple of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> to that of Jerusalem: with his companion <PERSON>Gabriel</PERSON> he successively ascended the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> heavens, and received and repaid the salutations of the patriarchs, the prophets, and the angels, in their respective mansions.
 Beyond the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> heaven, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> alone was permitted to proceed; he passed the veil of unity, approached within <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> bow-shots of the throne, and felt a cold that pierced him to the heart, when his shoulder was touched by the hand of God.
 After this familiar, though important conversation, he again descended to Jerusalem, remounted the Borak, returned to Mecca, and performed in the <ORDINAL>tenth</ORDINAL> part of a <TIME>night</TIME> the journey of many <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years.
 (98) According to another legend, the apostle confounded in a national assembly the malicious challenge of the Koreish.
 His resistless word split asunder the orb of the moon: the obedient planet stooped from her station in the sky, accomplished the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> revolutions round the Caaba, saluted <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> in the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> tongue, and, suddenly contracting her dimensions, entered at the collar, and issued forth through the sleeve, of his shirt.
 (99) The vulgar are amused with these marvellous tales; but the gravest of the <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> doctors imitate the modesty of their master, and indulge a latitude of faith or interpretation.
 (100) They might speciously allege, that in preaching the religion it was needless to violate the harmony of nature; that a creed unclouded with mystery may be excused from miracles; and that the sword of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was not less potent than the rod of Moses.
 Precepts of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> - prayer, fasting, alms.
 The polytheist is oppressed and distracted by the variety of superstition: a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> rites of <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> origin were interwoven with the essence of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> law; and the spirit of the gospel had evaporated in the pageantry of the church.
 The prophet of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> was tempted by prejudice, or policy, or patriotism, to sanctify the rites of the Arabians, and the custom of visiting the holy stone of the Caaba.
 But the precepts of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> himself inculcates a more simple and rational piety: prayer, fasting, and alms, are the religious duties of a Mussulman; and he is encouraged to hope, that prayer will carry him <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> way to God, fasting will bring him to the door of his palace, and alms will gain him admittance.
 (101) I.
 According to the tradition of the nocturnal journey, the apostle, in his personal conference with the Deity, was commanded to impose on his disciples the daily obligation of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> prayers.
 By the advice of Moses, he applied for an alleviation of this intolerable burden; the number was gradually reduced to five; without any dispensation of business or pleasure, or time or place: the devotion of the faithful is repeated at daybreak, at noon, in the afternoon, in the evening, and at the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> watch of the night; and in the present decay of religious fervour, our travellers are edified by the profound humility and attention of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Persians.
 Cleanliness is the key of prayer: the frequent lustration of the hands, the face, and the body, which was practised of old by the Arabs, is solemnly enjoined by the Koran; and a permission is formally granted to supply with sand the scarcity of water.
 The words and attitudes of supplication, as it is performed either sitting, or standing, or prostrate on the ground, are prescribed by custom or authority; but the prayer is poured forth in short and fervent ejaculations; the measure of zeal is not exhausted by a tedious liturgy; and each <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> for his own person is invested with the character of a priest.
 Among the theists, who reject the use of images, it has been found necessary to restrain the wanderings of the fancy, by directing the eye and the thought towards a kebla, or visible point of the horizon.
 The prophet was at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> inclined to gratify the <NORP>Jews</NORP> by the choice of Jerusalem; but he soon returned to a more natural partiality; and <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> times every <DATE>day</DATE> the eyes of the nations at Astracan, at Fez, at Delhi, are devoutly turned to the holy temple of Mecca.
 Yet every spot for the service of God is equally pure: the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> indifferently pray in their chamber or in the street.
 As a distinction from the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and Christians, the Friday in each week is set apart for the useful institution of public worship: the people is assembled in the mosch; and the imam, some respectable elder, ascends the pulpit, to begin the prayer and pronounce the sermon.
 But the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> religion is destitute of priesthood or sacrifice; and the independent spirit of fanaticism looks down with contempt on the ministers and the slaves of superstition.
 II.
 The voluntary (102) penance of the ascetics, the torment and glory of their lives, was odious to a prophet who censured in his companions a rash vow of abstaining from flesh, and women, and sleep; and firmly declared, that he would suffer no monks in his religion.
 (103) Yet he instituted, in each year, a fast of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> days; and strenuously recommended the observance as a discipline which purifies the soul and subdues the body, as a salutary exercise of obedience to the will of God and his apostle.
 During the <DATE>month</DATE> of Ramadan, from the rising to the setting of the sun, the <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> abstains from eating, and drinking, and women, and baths, and perfumes; from all nourishment that can restore his strength, from all pleasure that can gratify his senses.
 In the revolution of the lunar year, the Ramadan coincides, by turns, with the <DATE>winter</DATE> cold and the summer heat; and the patient martyr, without assuaging his thirst with a drop of water, must expect the close of a tedious and sultry day.
 The interdiction of wine, peculiar to some orders of priests or hermits, is converted by <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> alone into a positive and general law; (104) and a considerable portion of the globe has abjured, at his command, the use of that salutary, though dangerous, liquor.
 These painful restraints are, doubtless, infringed by the libertine, and eluded by the hypocrite; but the legislator, by whom they are enacted, cannot surely be accused of alluring his proselytes by the indulgence of their sensual appetites.
 III.
 The charity of the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> descends to the animal creation; and the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> repeatedly inculcates, not as a merit, but as a strict and indispensable duty, the relief of the indigent and unfortunate.
 Mahomet, perhaps, is the only lawgiver who has defined the precise measure of charity: the standard may vary with the degree and nature of property, as it consists either in money, in corn or cattle, in fruits or merchandise; but the <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> does not accomplish the law, unless he bestows a <ORDINAL>tenth</ORDINAL> of his revenue; and if his conscience accuses him of fraud or extortion, the tenth, under the idea of restitution, is enlarged to a fifth.
 (105) Benevolence is the foundation of justice, since we are forbid to injure those whom we are bound to assist.
 A prophet may reveal the secrets of heaven and of futurity; but in his moral precepts he can only repeat the lessons of our own hearts.
 Resurrection The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> articles of belief, and the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> practical duties, of Islam, are guarded by rewards and punishments; and the faith of the <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> is devoutly fixed on the event of the judgment and the last day.
 The prophet has not presumed to determine the moment of that awful catastrophe, though he darkly announces the signs, both in heaven and earth, which will precede the universal dissolution, when life shall be destroyed, and the order of creation shall be confounded in the primitive chaos.
 At the blast of the trumpet, new worlds will start into being: angels, genii, and men will arise from the dead, and the human soul will again be united to the body.
 The doctrine of the resurrection was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> entertained by the Egyptians; (106) and their mummies were embalmed, their pyramids were constructed, to preserve the ancient mansion of the soul, during a period of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years.
 But the attempt is partial and unavailing; and it is with a more philosophic spirit that <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> relies on the omnipotence of the Creator, whose word can reanimate the breathless clay, and collect the innumerable atoms, that no longer retain their form or substance.
 (107) The intermediate state of the soul it is hard to decide; and those who most firmly believe her immaterial nature, are at a loss to understand how she can think or act without the agency of the organs of sense.
 Hell and paradise.
 The reunion of the soul and body will be followed by the final judgment of mankind; and in his copy of the <NORP>Magian</NORP> picture, the prophet has too faithfully represented the forms of proceeding, and even the slow and successive operations, of an earthly tribunal.
 By his intolerant adversaries he is upbraided for extending, even to themselves, the hope of salvation, for asserting the blackest heresy, that every man who believes in God, and accomplishes good works, may expect in the last <DATE>day</DATE> a favourable sentence.
 Such rational indifference is ill adapted to the character of a fanatic; nor is it probable that a messenger from heaven should depreciate the value and necessity of his own revelation.
 In the idiom of the Koran, (108) the belief of God is inseparable from that of Mahomet: the good works are those which he has enjoined, and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> qualifications imply the profession of Islam, to which all nations and all sects are equally invited.
 Their spiritual blindness, though excused by ignorance and crowned with virtue, will be scourged with everlasting torments; and the tears which <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> shed over the tomb of his mother for whom he was forbidden to pray, display a striking contrast of humanity and enthusiasm.
 (109) The doom of the infidels is common: the measure of their guilt and punishment is determined by the degree of evidence which they have rejected, by the magnitude of the errors which they have entertained: the eternal mansions of the Christians, the Jews, the Sabians, the Magians, and idolaters, are sunk below each other in the abyss; and the lowest hell is reserved for the faithless hypocrites who have assumed the mask of religion.
 After the greater part of mankind has been condemned for their opinions, the true believers only will be judged by their actions.
 The good and evil of each <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> will be accurately weighed in a real or allegorical balance; and a singular mode of compensation will be allowed for the payment of injuries: the aggressor will refund an equivalent of his own good actions, for the benefit of the person whom he has wronged; and if he should be destitute of any moral property, the weight of his sins will be loaded with an adequate share of the demerits of the sufferer.
 According as the shares of guilt or virtue shall preponderate, the sentence will be pronounced, and all, without distinction, will pass over the sharp and perilous bridge of the abyss; but the innocent, treading in the footsteps of Mahomet, will gloriously enter the gates of paradise, while the guilty will fall into the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and mildest of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hells.
 The term of expiation will vary from <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> to <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years; but the prophet has judiciously promised, that all his disciples, whatever may be their sins, shall be saved, by their own faith and his intercession from eternal damnation.
 It is not surprising that superstition should act most powerfully on the fears of her votaries, since the human fancy can paint with more energy the misery than the bliss of a future life.
 With the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> simple elements of darkness and fire, we create a sensation of pain, which may be aggravated to an infinite degree by the idea of endless duration.
 But the same idea operates with an opposite effect on the continuity of pleasure; and too much of our present enjoyments is obtained from the relief, or the comparison, of evil.
 It is natural enough that an <NORP>Arabian</NORP> prophet should dwell with rapture on the groves, the fountains, and the rivers of paradise; but instead of inspiring the blessed inhabitants with a liberal taste for harmony and science, conversation and friendship, he idly celebrates the pearls and diamonds, the robes of silk, palaces of marble, dishes of gold, rich wines, artificial dainties, numerous attendants, and the whole train of sensual and costly luxury, which becomes insipid to the owner, even in the short period of this mortal life.
 Seventy-two Houris, or black-eyed girls, of resplendent beauty, blooming youth, virgin purity, and exquisite sensibility, will be created for the use of the meanest believer; a moment of pleasure will be prolonged to a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> years; and his faculties will be increased a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> fold, to render him worthy of his felicity.
 Notwithstanding a vulgar prejudice, the gates of heaven will be open to both sexes; but <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> has not specified the male companions of the female elect, lest he should either alarm the jealousy of their former husbands, or disturb their felicity, by the suspicion of an everlasting marriage.
 This image of a carnal paradise has provoked the indignation, perhaps the envy, of the monks: they declaim against the impure religion of Mahomet; and his modest apologists are driven to the poor excuse of figures and allegories.
 But the sounder and more consistent party adhere without shame, to the literal interpretation of the Koran: useless would be the resurrection of the body, unless it were restored to the possession and exercise of its worthiest faculties; and the union of sensual and intellectual enjoyment is requisite to complete the happiness of the double animal, the perfect man.
 Yet the joys of the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> paradise will not be confined to the indulgence of luxury and appetite; and the prophet has expressly declared that all meaner happiness will be forgotten and despised by the saints and martyrs, who shall be admitted to the beatitude of the divine vision.

 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most arduous conquests of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> (111) were those of his wife, his servant, his pupil, and his friend; (112) since he presented himself as a prophet to those who were most conversant with his infirmities as a man.
 Yet <PERSON>Cadijah</PERSON> believed the words, and cherished the glory, of her husband; the obsequious and affectionate <PERSON>Zeid</PERSON> was tempted by the prospect of freedom; the illustrious Ali, the son of Abu Taleb, embraced the sentiments of his cousin with the spirit of a youthful hero; and the wealth, the moderation, the veracity of <PERSON>Abubeker</PERSON> confirmed the religion of the prophet whom he was destined to succeed.
 By his persuasion, <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> of the most respectable citizens of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> were introduced to the private lessons of Islam; they yielded to the voice of reason and enthusiasm; they repeated the fundamental creed, and their faith, even in this life, was rewarded with riches and honours, with the command of armies and the government of kingdoms.
 Three years were silently employed in the conversion of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> proselytes, the first-fruits of his mission; but in the fourth year he assumed the prophetic office, and resolving to impart to his family the light of divine truth, he prepared a banquet, a lamb, as it is said, and a bowl of milk, for the entertainment of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> guests of the race of Hashem.
 No answer was returned, till the silence of astonishment, and doubt, and contempt, was at length broken by the impatient courage of Ali, a youth in the fourteenth year of his age.
 <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> accepted his offer with transport, and Abu Taled was ironically exhorted to respect the superior dignity of his son.
 In a more serious tone, the father of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> advised his nephew to relinquish his impracticable design.
 He persevered <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years in the exercise of his mission; and the religion which has overspread the <LOC>East</LOC> and the <LOC>West</LOC> advanced with a slow and painful progress within the walls of Mecca.
 Yet <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> enjoyed the satisfaction of beholding the increase of his infant congregation of Unitarians, who revered him as a prophet, and to whom he seasonably dispensed the spiritual nourishment of the Koran.
 The number of proselytes may be esteemed by the absence of <CARDINAL>eighty-three</CARDINAL> men and <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> women, who retired to <PERSON>Aethiopia</PERSON> in the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> year of his mission; and his party was fortified by the timely conversion of his uncle Hamza, and of the fierce and inflexible Omar, who signalized in the cause of <ORG>Islam</ORG> the same zeal, which he had exerted for its destruction.
 Nor was the charity of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> confined to the tribe of Koreish, or the precincts of Mecca: on solemn festivals, in the days of pilgrimage, he frequented the Caaba, accosted the strangers of every tribe, and urged, both in private converse and public discourse, the belief and worship of a sole Deity.
 Conscious of his reason and of his weakness, he asserted the liberty of conscience, and disclaimed the use of religious violence: (114) but he called the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> to repentance, and conjured them to remember the ancient idolaters of <PERSON>Ad</PERSON> and Thamud, whom the divine justice had swept away from the face of the earth.

 613-622.
 The people of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> were hardened in their unbelief by superstition and envy.
 The elders of the city, the uncles of the prophet, affected to despise the presumption of an orphan, the reformer of his country: the pious orations of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> in the <NORP>Caaba</NORP> were answered by the clamours of Abu Taleb.
 Yet the son of <PERSON>Abdallah</PERSON> was ever dear to the aged chief: and he protected the fame and person of his nephew against the assaults of the Koreishites, who had long been jealous of the preeminence of the family of Hashem.
 Their malice was colored with the pretence of religion: in the age of Job, the crime of impiety was punished by the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> magistrate; (116) and <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was guilty of deserting and denying the national deities.
 But so loose was the policy of Mecca, that the leaders of the Koreish, instead of accusing a criminal, were compelled to employ the measures of persuasion or violence.
 They repeatedly addressed Abu Taleb in the style of reproach and menace.
 The weight and moderation of Abu Taleb eluded the violence of religious faction; the most helpless or timid of the disciples retired to Aethiopia, and the prophet withdrew himself to various places of strength in the town and country.
 As he was still supported by his family, the rest of the tribe of <NORP>Koreish</NORP> engaged themselves to renounce all intercourse with the children of Hashem, neither to buy nor sell, neither to marry not to give in marriage, but to pursue them with implacable enmity, till they should deliver the person of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> to the justice of the gods.
 The decree was suspended in the <NORP>Caaba</NORP> before the eyes of the nation; the messengers of the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> pursued the <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> exiles in the heart of Africa: they besieged the prophet and his most faithful followers, intercepted their water, and inflamed their mutual animosity by the retaliation of injuries and insults.
 A doubtful truce restored the appearances of concord till the death of Abu Taleb abandoned <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> to the power of his enemies, at the moment when he was deprived of his domestic comforts by the loss of his faithful and generous Cadijah.
 Abu Sophian, the chief of the branch of Ommiyah, succeeded to the principality of the republic of Mecca.
 A zealous votary of the idols, a mortal foe of the line of Hashem, he convened an assembly of the <NORP>Koreishites</NORP> and their allies, to decide the fate of the apostle.
 His imprisonment might provoke the despair of his enthusiasm; and the exile of an eloquent and popular fanatic would diffuse the mischief through the provinces of Arabia.
 His death was resolved; and they agreed that a sword from each tribe should be buried in his heart, to divide the guilt of his blood, and baffle the vengeance of the Hashemites.
 and driven from Mecca, A.
D.
 622.
 An angel or a spy revealed their conspiracy; and flight was the only resource of Mahomet.
 (117) At the dead of night, accompanied by his friend Abubeker, he silently escaped from his house: the assassins watched at the door; but they were deceived by the figure of Ali, who reposed on the bed, and was covered with the green vestment of the apostle.
 The <NORP>Koreish</NORP> respected the piety of the heroic youth; but some verses of Ali, which are still extant, exhibit an interesting picture of his anxiety, his tenderness, and his religious confidence.
 Three days <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> and his companion were concealed in the cave of Thor, at the distance of a league from Mecca; and in the close of each evening, they received from the son and daughter of <PERSON>Abubeker</PERSON> a secret supply of intelligence and food.
 The diligence of the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> explored every haunt in the neighbourhood of the city: they arrived at the entrance of the cavern; but the providential deceit of a spider's web and a pigeon's nest is supposed to convince them that the place was solitary and inviolate.
 "We are only two," said the trembling Abubeker.
 No sooner was the pursuit abated than the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fugitives issued from the rock, and mounted their camels: on the road to Medina, they were overtaken by the emissaries of the Koreish; they redeemed themselves with prayers and promises from their hands.
 In this eventful moment, the lance of an <NORP>Arab</NORP> might have changed the history of the world.
 The flight of the prophet from <GPE>Mecca</GPE> to <GPE>Medina</GPE> has fixed the memorable era of the Hegira, (118) which, at the end of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> centuries, still discriminates the lunar years of the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> nations.
 (119) Received as prince of Medina, A.

 622.
 The religion of the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> might have perished in its cradle, had not <GPE>Medina</GPE> embraced with faith and reverence the holy outcasts of Mecca.
 Medina, or the city, known under the name of Yathreb, before it was sanctified by the throne of the prophet, was divided between the tribes of the <NORP>Charegites</NORP> and the Awsites, whose hereditary feud was rekindled by the slightest provocations: <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> colonies of Jews, who boasted a sacerdotal race, were their humble allies, and without converting the Arabs, they introduced the taste of science and religion, which distinguished <GPE>Medina</GPE> as the city of the Book.
 Some of her noblest citizens, in a pilgrimage to the Canaba, were converted by the preaching of Mahomet; on their return, they diffused the belief of God and his prophet, and the new alliance was ratified by their deputies in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> secret and nocturnal interviews on a hill in the suburbs of Mecca.
 In the first, <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <NORP>Charegites</NORP> and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Awsites</NORP> united in faith and love, protested, in the name of their wives, their children, and their absent brethren, that they would forever profess the creed, and observe the precepts, of the Koran.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> was a political association, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> vital spark of the empire of the Saracens.
 (120) <CARDINAL>Seventy-three</CARDINAL> men and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> women of <GPE>Medina</GPE> held a solemn conference with Mahomet, his kinsman, and his disciples; and pledged themselves to each other by a mutual oath of fidelity.
 They promised, in the name of the city, that if he should be banished, they would receive him as a confederate, obey him as a leader, and defend him to the last extremity, like their wives and children.
 He stretched it forth, and they reiterated the oath of allegiance and fidelity.
 Their treaty was ratified by the people, who unanimously embraced the profession of Islam; they rejoiced in the exile of the apostle, but they trembled for his safety, and impatiently expected his arrival.
 After a perilous and rapid journey along the sea-coast, he halted at Koba, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the city, and made his public entry into Medina, sixteen days after his flight from Mecca.
 <CARDINAL>Five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of the citizens advanced to meet him; he was hailed with acclamations of loyalty and devotion; <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was mounted on a she-camel, an umbrella shaded his head, and a turban was unfurled before him to supply the deficiency of a standard.
 His bravest disciples, who had been scattered by the storm, assembled round his person; and the equal, though various, merit of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> was distinguished by the names of <NORP>Mohagerians</NORP> and Ansars, the fugitives of Mecca, and the auxiliaries of Medina.
 To eradicate the seeds of jealousy, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> judiciously coupled his principal followers with the rights and obligations of brethren; and when <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> found himself without a peer, the prophet tenderly declared, that he would be the companion and brother of the noble youth.
 The expedient was crowned with success; the holy fraternity was respected in peace and war, and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> parties vied with each other in a generous emulation of courage and fidelity.
 Once only the concord was slightly ruffled by an accidental quarrel: a patriot of <GPE>Medina</GPE> arraigned the insolence of the strangers, but the hint of their expulsion was heard with abhorrence; and his own son most eagerly offered to lay at the apostle's feet the head of his father.
 His regal dignity, A.
D.
 622-632.
 From his establishment at Medina, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> assumed the exercise of the regal and sacerdotal office; and it was impious to appeal from a judge whose decrees were inspired by the divine wisdom.
 A small portion of ground, the patrimony of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> orphans, was acquired by gift or purchase; (121) on that chosen spot he built a house and a mosch, more venerable in their rude simplicity than the palaces and temples of the <NORP>Assyrian</NORP> caliphs.
 His seal of gold, or silver, was inscribed with the apostolic title; when he prayed and preached in the weekly assembly, he leaned against the trunk of a palm-tree; and it was long before he indulged himself in the use of a chair or pulpit of rough timber.
 (122) After a reign of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years, <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Moslems, in arms and in the field, renewed their oath of allegiance; and their chief repeated the assurance of protection till the death of the last member, or the final dissolution of the party.
 It was in the same camp that the deputy of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> was astonished by the attention of the faithful to the words and looks of the prophet, by the eagerness with which they collected his spittle, a hair that dropped on the ground, the refuse water of his lustrations, as if they participated in some degree of the prophetic virtue.
 The devout fervour of enthusiasm acts with more energy and truth than the cold and formal servility of courts.
 He declares war against the infidels In the state of nature, every man has a right to defend, by force of arms, his person and his possessions; to repel, or even to prevent, the violence of his enemies, and to extend his hostilities to a reasonable measure of satisfaction and retaliation.
 In the free society of the Arabs, the duties of subject and citizen imposed a feeble restraint; and Mahomet, in the exercise of a peaceful and benevolent mission, had been despoiled and banished by the injustice of his countrymen.
 The choice of an independent people had exalted the fugitive of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> to the rank of a sovereign; and he was invested with the just prerogative of forming alliances, and of waging offensive or defensive war.
 The imperfection of human rights was supplied and armed by the plenitude of divine power: the prophet of <GPE>Medina</GPE> assumed, in his new revelations, a fiercer and more sanguinary tone, which proves that his former moderation was the effect of weakness: (123) the means of persuasion had been tried, the season of forbearance was elapsed, and he was now commanded to propagate his religion by the sword, to destroy the monuments of idolatry, and, without regarding the sanctity of days or months, to pursue the unbelieving nations of the earth.
 The same bloody precepts, so repeatedly inculcated in the Koran, are ascribed by the author to the <WORK_OF_ART>Pentateuch</WORK_OF_ART> and the Gospel.
 But the mild tenor of the evangelic style may explain an ambiguous text, that <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> did not bring peace on the earth, but a sword: his patient and humble virtues should not be confounded with the intolerant zeal of princes and bishops, who have disgraced the name of his disciples.
 In the prosecution of religious war, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> might appeal with more propriety to the example of Moses, of the Judges, and the kings of Israel.
 The military laws of the <NORP>Hebrews</NORP> are still more rigid than those of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> legislator.
 (124) The Lord of hosts marched in person before the Jews: if a city resisted their summons, the males, without distinction, were put to the sword: the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> nations of <GPE>Canaan</GPE> were devoted to destruction; and neither repentance nor conversion, could shield them from the inevitable doom, that no creature within their precincts should be left alive.
 The fair option of friendship, or submission, or battle, was proposed to the enemies of Mahomet.
 If they professed the creed of Islam, they were admitted to all the temporal and spiritual benefits of his primitive disciples, and marched under the same banner to extend the religion which they had embraced.
 The clemency of the prophet was decided by his interest: yet he seldom trampled on a prostrate enemy; and he seems to promise, that on the payment of a tribute, the least guilty of his unbelieving subjects might be indulged in their worship, or at least in their imperfect faith.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <DATE>months</DATE> of his reign he practised the lessons of holy warfare, and displayed his white banner before the gates of Medina: the martial apostle fought in person at <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> battles or sieges; (125) and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> enterprises of war were achieved in <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years by himself or his lieutenants.
 The <NORP>Arab</NORP> continued to unite the professions of a merchant and a robber; and his petty excursions for the defence or the attack of a caravan insensibly prepared his troops for the conquest of Arabia.
 The distribution of the spoil was regulated by a divine law: (126) the whole was faithfully collected in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> common mass: a <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> of the gold and silver, the prisoners and cattle, the movables and immovables, was reserved by the prophet for pious and charitable uses; the remainder was shared in adequate portions by the soldiers who had obtained the victory or guarded the camp: the rewards of the slain devolved to their widows and orphans; and the increase of cavalry was encouraged by the allotment of a double share to the horse and to the man.
 From all sides the roving <NORP>Arabs</NORP> were allured to the standard of religion and plunder: the apostle sanctified the license of embracing the female captives as their wives or concubines, and the enjoyment of wealth and beauty was a feeble type of the joys of paradise prepared for the valiant martyrs of the faith.
 The intrepid souls of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> were fired with enthusiasm: the picture of the invisible world was strongly painted on their imagination; and the death which they had always despised became an object of hope and desire.
 The <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> inculcates, in the most absolute sense, the tenets of fate and predestination, which would extinguish both industry and virtue, if the actions of man were governed by his speculative belief.
 Yet their influence in every age has exalted the courage of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> and Turks.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> companions of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> advanced to battle with a fearless confidence: there is no danger where there is no chance: they were ordained to perish in their beds; or they were safe and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy.
 (127) His defensive war against the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> of Mecca.
 Perhaps the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> would have been content with the flight of Mahomet, had they not been provoked and alarmed by the vengeance of an enemy, who could intercept their <NORP>Syrian</NORP> trade as it passed and repassed through the territory of Medina.
 Abu Sophian himself, with only <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> followers, conducted a wealthy caravan of a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> camels; the fortune or dexterity of his march escaped the vigilance of Mahomet; but the chief of the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> was informed that the holy robbers were placed in ambush to await his return.
 He despatched a messenger to his brethren of Mecca, and they were roused, by the fear of losing their merchandise and their provisions, unless they hastened to his relief with the military force of the city.
 The sacred band of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was formed of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> Moslems, of whom <CARDINAL>seventy-seven</CARDINAL> were fugitives, and the rest auxiliaries; they mounted by turns a train of <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> camels, (the camels of <PERSON>Yathreb</PERSON> were formidable in war;) but such was the poverty of his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> disciples, that only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> could appear on horseback in the field.
 (128) In the fertile and famous vale of Beder, (129) <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> stations from Medina, he was informed by his scouts of the caravan that approached on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> side; of the Koreish, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horse, <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> foot, who advanced on the other.
 After a short debate, he sacrificed the prospect of wealth to the pursuit of glory and revenge, and a slight entrenchment was formed, to cover his troops, and a stream of fresh water, that glided through the valley.
 Battle of Beder, A.
D.
 623.
 At these words he placed himself, with Abubeker, on a throne or pulpit, (130) and instantly demanded the succour of <PERSON>Gabriel</PERSON> and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> angels.
 His eye was fixed on the field of battle: the <NORP>Mussulmans</NORP> fainted and were pressed: in that decisive moment the prophet started from his throne, mounted his horse, and cast a handful of sand into the air: Both armies heard the thunder of his voice: their fancy beheld the angelic warriors: (131) the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> trembled and fled: <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> of the bravest were slain; and <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> captives adorned the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> victory of the faithful.
 The dead bodies of the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> were despoiled and insulted: <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of the most obnoxious prisoners were punished with death; and the ransom of the others, <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> drams of silver, compensated in some degree the escape of the caravan.
 But it was in vain that the camels of Abu Sophian explored a new road through the desert and along the Euphrates: they were overtaken by the diligence of the Mussulmans; and wealthy must have been the prize, if <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> drams could be set apart for the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> of the apostle.
 The resentment of the public and private loss stimulated Abu Sophian to collect a body of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> men, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> of whom were armed with cuirasses, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> were mounted on horseback; <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> camels attended his march; and his wife Henda, with <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> matrons of Mecca, incessantly sounded their timbrels to animate the troops, and to magnify the greatness of Hobal, the most popular deity of the Caaba.
 of Ohud, A.
D.
 623.
 The standard of God and <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was upheld by <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> believers: the disproportion of numbers was not more alarming than in the field of Beder; and their presumption of victory prevailed against the divine and human sense of the apostle.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> battle was fought on Mount Ohud, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> miles to the north of Medina; (132) the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> advanced in the form of a crescent; and the right wing of cavalry was led by Caled, the fiercest and most successful of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> warriors.
 The troops of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> were skilfully posted on the declivity of the hill; and their rear was guarded by a detachment of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> archers.
 The weight of their charge impelled and broke the centre of the idolaters: but in the pursuit they lost the advantage of their ground: the archers deserted their station: the <NORP>Mussulmans</NORP> were tempted by the spoil, disobeyed their general, and disordered their ranks.
 The intrepid Caled, wheeling his cavalry on their flank and rear, exclaimed, with a loud voice, that <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was slain.
 He was indeed wounded in the face with a javelin: <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of his teeth were shattered with a stone; yet, in the midst of tumult and dismay, he reproached the infidels with the murder of a prophet; and blessed the friendly hand that stanched his blood, and conveyed him to a place of safety.
 <CARDINAL>Seventy</CARDINAL> martyrs died for the sins of the people; they fell, said the apostle, in pairs, each brother embracing his lifeless companion; (133) their bodies were mangled by the inhuman females of Mecca; and the wife of Abu Sophian tasted the entrails of Hamza, the uncle of Mahomet.
 They might applaud their superstition, and satiate their fury; but the <NORP>Mussulmans</NORP> soon rallied in the field, and the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> wanted strength or courage to undertake the siege of Medina.
 The nations or the ditch, A.
D.
 625.
 It was attacked the ensuing year by an army of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> enemies; and this <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> expedition is variously named from the nations, which marched under the banner of Abu Sophian, from the ditch which was drawn before the city, and a camp of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Mussulmans.
 The prudence of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> declined a general engagement: the valour of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> was signalized in single combat; and the war was protracted <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> days, till the final separation of the confederates.
 A tempest of wind, rain, and hail, overturned their tents: their private quarrels were fomented by an insidious adversary; and the Koreish, deserted by their allies, no longer hoped to subvert the throne, or to check the conquests, of their invincible exile.
 (134) <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> subdues the <NORP>Jews</NORP> of Arabia, A.
D.
 623-627.
 The choice of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> kebla of prayer discovers the early propensity of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> in favour of the Jews; and happy would it have been for their temporal interest, had they recognized, in the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> prophet, the hope of <GPE>Israel</GPE> and the promised Messiah.
 Their obstinacy converted his friendship into implacable hatred, with which he pursued that unfortunate people to the last moment of his life; and in the double character of an apostle and a conqueror, his persecution was extended to both worlds.
 (135) The <PERSON>Kainoka</PERSON> dwelt at <GPE>Medina</GPE> under the protection of the city; he seized the occasion of an accidental tumult, and summoned them to embrace his religion, or contend with him in battle.
 The unequal conflict was terminated in <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> days; and it was with extreme reluctance that <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> yielded to the importunity of his allies, and consented to spare the lives of the captives.
 But their riches were confiscated, their arms became more effectual in the hands of the Mussulmans; and a wretched colony of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> exiles was driven, with their wives and children, to implore a refuge on the confines of Syria.
 The <PERSON>Nadhirites</PERSON> were more guilty, since they conspired, in a friendly interview, to assassinate the prophet.
 He besieged their castle, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles from Medina; but their resolute defence obtained an honourable capitulation; and the garrison, sounding their trumpets and beating their drums, was permitted to depart with the honours of war.
 The <NORP>Jews</NORP> had excited and joined the war of the Koreish: no sooner had the nations retired from the ditch, than Mahomet, without laying aside his armour, marched on the same <DATE>day</DATE> to extirpate the hostile race of the children of Koraidha.
 After a resistance of <CARDINAL>twenty-five</CARDINAL> days, they surrendered at discretion.
 They trusted to the intercession of their old allies of Medina; they could not be ignorant that fanaticism obliterates the feelings of humanity.
 A venerable elder, to whose judgment they appealed, pronounced the sentence of their death; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <NORP>Jews</NORP> were dragged in chains to the market-place of the city; they descended alive into the grave prepared for their execution and burial; and the apostle beheld with an inflexible eye the slaughter of his helpless enemies.
 Their sheep and camels were inherited by the Mussulmans: <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> cuirasses, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> piles, a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> lances, composed the most useful portion of the spoil.
 Six days' journey to the north-east of Medina, the ancient and wealthy town of <PERSON>Chaibar</PERSON> was the seat of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> power in Arabia: the territory, a fertile spot in the desert, was covered with plantations and cattle, and protected by <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> castles, some of which were esteemed of impregnable strength.
 The forces of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> consisted of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horse and <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> foot: in the succession of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> regular and painful sieges they were exposed to danger, and fatigue, and hunger; and the most undaunted chiefs despaired of the event.
 The apostle revived their faith and courage by the example of Ali, on whom he bestowed the surname of the Lion of God: perhaps we may believe that a <NORP>Hebrew</NORP> champion of gigantic stature was cloven to the chest by his irresistible cimeter; but we cannot praise the modesty of romance, which represents him as tearing from its hinges the gate of a fortress and wielding the ponderous buckler in his left hand.
 (136) After the reduction of the castles, the town of <PERSON>Chaibar</PERSON> submitted to the yoke.
 The chief of the tribe was tortured, in the presence of Mahomet, to force a confession of his hidden treasure: the industry of the shepherds and husbandmen was rewarded with a precarious toleration: they were permitted, so long as it should please the conqueror, to improve their patrimony, in equal shares, for his emolument and their own.
 Under the reign of Omar, the <NORP>Jews</NORP> of <PERSON>Chaibar</PERSON> were transported to Syria; and the caliph alleged the injunction of his dying master; that <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> and the true religion should be professed in his native land of Arabia.
 (137) Submission of Mecca, A.
D.
 629.
 <CARDINAL>Five</CARDINAL> times each <DATE>day</DATE> the eyes of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> were turned towards Mecca, (138) and he was urged by the most sacred and powerful motives to revisit, as a conqueror, the city and the temple from whence he had been driven as an exile.
 The <NORP>Caaba</NORP> was present to his waking and sleeping fancy: an idle dream was translated into vision and prophecy; he unfurled the holy banner; and a rash promise of success too hastily dropped from the lips of the apostle.
 His march from <GPE>Medina</GPE> to <GPE>Mecca</GPE> displayed the peaceful and solemn pomp of a pilgrimage: <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> camels, chosen and bedecked for sacrifice, preceded the van; the sacred territory was respected; and the captives were dismissed without ransom to proclaim his clemency and devotion.
 But no sooner did <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> descend into the plain, within a day's journey of the city, than he exclaimed, the numbers and resolution of the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> opposed his progress; and the roving <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of the desert might desert or betray a leader whom they had followed for the hopes of spoil.
 The intrepid fanatic sunk into a cool and cautious politician: he waived in the treaty his title of apostle of God; concluded with the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> and their allies a truce of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> years; engaged to restore the fugitives of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> who should embrace his religion; and stipulated only, for the ensuing year, the humble privilege of entering the city as a friend, and of remaining <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days to accomplish the rites of the pilgrimage.
 A cloud of shame and sorrow hung on the retreat of the Mussulmans, and their disappointment might justly accuse the failure of a prophet who had so often appealed to the evidence of success.
 The faith and hope of the pilgrims were rekindled by the prospect of Mecca: their swords were sheathed; <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> times in the footsteps of the apostle they encompassed the Caaba: the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> had retired to the hills, and Mahomet, after the customary sacrifice, evacuated the city on the fourth day.
 The people was edified by his devotion; the hostile chiefs were awed, or divided, or seduced; and both <PERSON>Kaled</PERSON> and Amrou, the future conquerors of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Egypt, most seasonably deserted the sinking cause of idolatry.
 The power of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was increased by the submission of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> tribes; <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers were assembled for the conquest of Mecca; and the idolaters, the weaker party, were easily convicted of violating the truce.
 Enthusiasm and discipline impelled the march, and preserved the secret till the blaze of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> fires proclaimed to the astonished <NORP>Koreish</NORP> the design, the approach, and the irresistible force of the enemy.
 The haughty Abu Sophian presented the keys of the city, admired the variety of arms and ensigns that passed before him in review; observed that the son of <PERSON>Abdallah</PERSON> had acquired a mighty kingdom, and confessed, under the cimeter of Omar, that he was the apostle of the true God.
 The return of <PERSON>Marius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Scylla</PERSON> was stained with the blood of the Romans: the revenge of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was stimulated by religious zeal, and his injured followers were eager to execute or to prevent the order of a massacre.
 Instead of indulging their passions and his own, (139) the victorious exile forgave the guilt, and united the factions, of Mecca.
 His troops, in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> divisions, marched into the city: <CARDINAL>eight-and-twenty</CARDINAL> of the inhabitants were slain by the sword of Caled; <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> men and <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> women were proscribed by the sentence of Mahomet; but he blamed the cruelty of his lieutenant; and several of the most obnoxious victims were indebted for their lives to his clemency or contempt.
 The chiefs of the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> were prostrate at his feet.
 The people of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> deserved their pardon by the profession of Islam; and after an exile of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years, the fugitive missionary was enthroned as the prince and prophet of his native country.
 (140) But the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and sixty idols of the <NORP>Caaba</NORP> were ignominiously broken: the house of God was purified and adorned: as an example to future times, the apostle again fulfilled the duties of a pilgrim; and a perpetual law was enacted that no unbeliever should dare to set his foot on the territory of the holy city.
 (141) Conquest of Arabia, A.
D.
 629-632.
 The conquest of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> determined the faith and obedience of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> tribes; (142) who, according to the vicissitudes of fortune, had obeyed, or disregarded, the eloquence or the arms of the prophet.
 Indifference for rites and opinions still marks the character of the Bedoweens; and they might accept, as loosely as they hold, the doctrine of the Koran.
 Yet an obstinate remnant still adhered to the religion and liberty of their ancestors, and the war of <GPE>Honain</GPE> derived a proper appellation from the idols, whom <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> had vowed to destroy, and whom the confederates of <PERSON>Tayef</PERSON> had sworn to defend.
 (143) Four <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Pagans</NORP> advanced with secrecy and speed to surprise the conqueror: they pitied and despised the supine negligence of the Koreish, but they depended on the wishes, and perhaps the aid, of a people who had so lately renounced their gods, and bowed beneath the yoke of their enemy.
 The banners of <GPE>Medina</GPE> and <GPE>Mecca</GPE> were displayed by the prophet; a crowd of <NORP>Bedoweens</NORP> increased the strength or numbers of the army, and <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Mussulmans</NORP> entertained a rash and sinful presumption of their invincible strength.
 They descended without precaution into the valley of Honain: the heights had been occupied by the archers and slingers of the confederates; their numbers were oppressed, their discipline was confounded, their courage was appalled, and the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> smiled at their impending destruction.
 The prophet, on his white mule, was encompassed by the enemies: he attempted to rush against their spears in search of a glorious death: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> of his faithful companions interposed their weapons and their breasts; <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> of these fell dead at his feet: His uncle Abbas, who, like the heroes of Homer, excelled in the loudness of his voice, made the valley resound with the recital of the gifts and promises of God: the flying <NORP>Moslems</NORP> returned from all sides to the holy standard; and <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> observed with pleasure that the furnace was again rekindled: his conduct and example restored the battle, and he animated his victorious troops to inflict a merciless revenge on the authors of their shame.
 From the field of Honain, he marched without delay to the siege of Tayef, sixty miles to the south- east of Mecca, a fortress of strength, whose fertile lands produce the fruits of <GPE>Syria</GPE> in the midst of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> desert.
 A friendly tribe, instructed (I know not how) in the art of sieges, supplied him with a train of battering-rams and military engines, with a body of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> artificers.
 But it was in vain that he offered freedom to the slaves of Tayef; that he violated his own laws by the extirpation of the fruit-trees; that the ground was opened by the miners; that the breach was assaulted by the troops.
 After a siege of twenty-days, the prophet sounded a retreat; but he retreated with a song of devout triumph, and affected to pray for the repentance and safety of the unbelieving city.
 The spoils of this fortunate expedition amounted to <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> captives, <CARDINAL>twenty-four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> camels, <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> sheep, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> ounces of silver: a tribe who had fought at <PERSON>Hoinan</PERSON> redeemed their prisoners by the sacrifice of their idols; but <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> compensated the loss, by resigning to the soldiers his <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> of the plunder, and wished, for their sake, that he possessed as many head of cattle as there were trees in the province of Tehama.
 Instead of chastising the disaffection of the Koreish, he endeavoured to cut out their tongues, (his own expression,) and to secure their attachment by a superior measure of liberality: Abu Sophian alone was presented with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> camels and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> ounces of silver; and <GPE>Mecca</GPE> was sincerely converted to the profitable religion of the Koran.
 The fugitives and auxiliaries complained, that they who had borne the burden were neglected in the season of victory.
 He was followed by the deputies of Tayef, who dreaded the repetition of a siege.
 They submitted in silence: their temples were demolished, and the same sentence of destruction was executed on all the idols of Arabia.
 His lieutenants, on the shores of the Red Sea, the Ocean, and the Gulf of Persia, were saluted by the acclamations of a faithful people; and the ambassadors, who knelt before the throne of Medina, were as numerous (says the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> proverb) as the dates that fall from the maturity of a palm-tree.
 The nation submitted to the God and the sceptre of Mahomet: the opprobrious name of tribute was abolished: the spontaneous or reluctant oblations of arms and tithes were applied to the service of religion; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Moslems</NORP> accompanied the last pilgrimage of the apostle.
 (144) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> war of the <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> against the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 629, 630.
 When <GPE>Heraclius</GPE> returned in triumph from the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war, he entertained, at Emesa, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors of Mahomet, who invited the princes and nations of the earth to the profession of Islam.
 On this foundation the zeal of the <NORP>Arabians</NORP> has supposed the secret conversion of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperor: the vanity of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> has feigned a personal visit of the prince of Medina, who accepted from the royal bounty a rich domain, and a secure retreat, in the province of Syria.
 (145) But the friendship of <GPE>Heraclius</GPE> and <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was of short continuance: the new religion had inflamed rather than assuaged the rapacious spirit of the Saracens, and the murder of an envoy afforded a decent pretence for invading, with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers, the territory of Palestine, that extends to the eastward of the Jordan.
 The holy banner was entrusted to Zeid; and such was the discipline or enthusiasm of the rising sect, that the noblest chiefs served without reluctance under the slave of the prophet.
 On the event of his decease, <PERSON>Jaafar</PERSON> and <PERSON>Abdallah</PERSON> were successively substituted to the command; and if the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> should perish in the war, the troops were authorized to elect their general.
 The <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> leaders were slain in the battle of Muta, (146) the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> military action, which tried the valour of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> against a foreign enemy.
 <PERSON>Zeid</PERSON> fell, like a soldier, in the foremost ranks: the death of <PERSON>Jaafar</PERSON> was heroic and memorable: he lost his right hand: he shifted the standard to his left: the left was severed from his body: he embraced the standard with his bleeding stumps, till he was transfixed to the ground with <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> honourable wounds.
 The lance of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> decided the alternative; but the falling standard was rescued by Caled, the proselyte of Mecca: <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> swords were broken in his hand; and his valour withstood and repulsed the superior numbers of the Christians.
 In the nocturnal council of the camp he was chosen to command: his skilful evolutions of the ensuing <DATE>day</DATE> secured either the victory or the retreat of the Saracens; and <PERSON>Caled</PERSON> is renowned among his brethren and his enemies by the glorious appellation of the Sword of God.
 In the pulpit, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> described, with prophetic rapture, the crowns of the blessed martyrs; but in private he betrayed the feelings of human nature: he was surprised as he wept over the daughter of Zeid: "What do I see?" said the astonished votary.
 After the conquest of Mecca, the sovereign of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> affected to prevent the hostile preparations of Heraclius; and solemnly proclaimed war against the Romans, without attempting to disguise the hardships and dangers of the enterprise.
 (147) The <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were discouraged: they alleged the want of money, or horses, or provisions; the season of harvest, and the intolerable heat of the summer: "Hell is much hotter," said the indignant prophet.
 He disdained to compel their service: but on his return he admonished the most guilty, by an excommunication of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> days.
 Their desertion enhanced the merit of Abubeker, Othman, and the faithful companions who devoted their lives and fortunes; and <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> displayed his banner at the head of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> foot.
 Painful indeed was the distress of the march: lassitude and thirst were aggravated by the scorching and pestilential winds of the desert: <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> men rode by turns on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> camel; and they were reduced to the shameful necessity of drinking the water from the belly of that useful animal.
 In the mid-way, <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days' journey from <GPE>Medina</GPE> and Damascus, they reposed near the grove and fountain of Tabuc.
 Beyond that place <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> declined the prosecution of the war: he declared himself satisfied with the peaceful intentions, he was more probably daunted by the martial array, of the emperor of the East.
 But the active and intrepid <PERSON>Caled</PERSON> spread around the terror of his name; and the prophet received the submission of the tribes and cities, from the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> to Ailah, at the head of the Red Sea.
 To his <NORP>Christian</NORP> subjects, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> readily granted the security of their persons, the freedom of their trade, the property of their goods, and the toleration of their worship.
 (148) The weakness of their <NORP>Arabian</NORP> brethren had restrained them from opposing his ambition; the disciples of <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> were endeared to the enemy of the Jews; and it was the interest of a conqueror to propose a fair capitulation to the most powerful religion of the earth.
 Death of Mahomet, A.
D.
 632, June 7.
 Till the age of sixty-three years, the strength of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was equal to the temporal and spiritual fatigues of his mission.
 His epileptic fits, an absurd calumny of the Greeks, would be an object of pity rather than abhorrence; (149) but he seriously believed that he was poisoned at <PERSON>Chaibar</PERSON> by the revenge of a <NORP>Jewish</NORP> female.
 (150) During <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the health of the prophet declined; his infirmities increased; but his mortal disease was a fever of <CARDINAL>fourteen</CARDINAL> days, which deprived him by intervals of the use of reason.
 As soon as he was conscious of his danger, he edified his brethren by the humility of his virtue or penitence.
 <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> heard the complaint, satisfied the demand, and thanked his creditor for accusing him in this world rather than at the <DATE>day</DATE> of judgment.
 He beheld with temperate firmness the approach of death; enfranchised his slaves (seventeen men, as they are named, and <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> women;) minutely directed the order of his funeral, and moderated the lamentations of his weeping friends, on whom he bestowed the benediction of peace.
 Till the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> <DATE>day</DATE> before his death, he regularly performed the function of public prayer: the choice of <PERSON>Abubeker</PERSON> to supply his place, appeared to mark that ancient and faithful friend as his successor in the sacerdotal and regal office; but he prudently declined the risk and envy of a more explicit nomination.
 At a moment when his faculties were visibly impaired, he called for pen and ink to write, or, more properly, to dictate, a divine book, the sum and accomplishment of all his revelations: a dispute arose in the chamber, whether he should be allowed to supersede the authority of the Koran; and the prophet was forced to reprove the indecent vehemence of his disciples.
 If the slightest credit may be afforded to the traditions of his wives and companions, he maintained, in the bosom of his family, and to the last moments of his life, the dignity of an apostle, and the faith of an enthusiast; described the visits of Gabriel, who bade an everlasting farewell to the earth, and expressed his lively confidence, not only of the mercy, but of the favour, of the Supreme Being.
 In a familiar discourse he had mentioned his special prerogative, that the angel of death was not allowed to take his soul till he had respectfully asked the permission of the prophet.
 The request was granted; and <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> immediately fell into the agony of his dissolution: his head was reclined on the lap of Ayesha, the best beloved of all his wives; he fainted with the violence of pain; recovering his spirits, he raised his eyes towards the roof of the house, and, with a steady look, though a faltering voice, uttered the last broken, though articulate, words: and thus peaceably expired on a carpet spread upon the floor.
 An expedition for the conquest of <GPE>Syria</GPE> was stopped by this mournful event; the army halted at the gates of Medina; the chiefs were assembled round their dying master.
 The city, more especially the house, of the prophet, was a scene of clamorous sorrow of silent despair: fanaticism alone could suggest a ray of hope and consolation.
 The evidence of sense was disregarded; and Omar, unsheathing his cimeter, threatened to strike off the heads of the infidels, who should dare to affirm that the prophet was no more.
 The tumult was appeased by the weight and moderation of Abubeker.
 He was piously interred by the hands of his nearest kinsman, on the same spot on which he expired: (151) <GPE>Medina</GPE> has been sanctified by the death and burial of Mahomet; and the innumerable pilgrims of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> often turn aside from the way, to bow, in voluntary devotion, (152) before the simple tomb of the prophet.
 (153) His character.
 At the conclusion of the life of Mahomet, it may perhaps be expected, that I should balance his faults and virtues, that I should decide whether the title of enthusiast or impostor more properly belongs to that extraordinary man.
 Had I been intimately conversant with the son of Abdallah, the task would still be difficult, and the success uncertain: at the distance of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> centuries, I darkly contemplate his shade through a cloud of religious incense; and could I truly delineate the portrait of an hour, the fleeting resemblance would not equally apply to the solitary of Mount Hera, to the preacher of Mecca, and to the conqueror of Arabia.
 The author of a mighty revolution appears to have been endowed with a pious and contemplative disposition: so soon as marriage had raised him above the pressure of want, he avoided the paths of ambition and avarice; and till the age of <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> he lived with innocence, and would have died without a name.
 The unity of God is an idea most congenial to nature and reason; and a slight conversation with the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and <NORP>Christians</NORP> would teach him to despise and detest the idolatry of Mecca.
 It was the duty of a man and a citizen to impart the doctrine of salvation, to rescue his country from the dominion of sin and error.
 The energy of a mind incessantly bent on the same object, would convert a general obligation into a particular call; the warm suggestions of the understanding or the fancy would be felt as the inspirations of Heaven; the labour of thought would expire in rapture and vision; and the inward sensation, the invisible monitor, would be described with the form and attributes of an angel of God.
 (154) From enthusiasm to imposture, the step is perilous and slippery: the daemon of <PERSON>Socrates</PERSON> (155) affords a memorable instance, how a wise man may deceive himself, how a good man may deceive others, how the conscience may slumber in a mixed and middle state between self-illusion and voluntary fraud.
 Charity may believe that the original motives of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> were those of pure and genuine benevolence; but a human missionary is incapable of cherishing the obstinate unbelievers who reject his claims despise his arguments, and persecute his life; he might forgive his personal adversaries, he may lawfully hate the enemies of God; the stern passions of pride and revenge were kindled in the bosom of Mahomet, and he sighed, like the prophet of Nineveh, for the destruction of the rebels whom he had condemned.
 The injustice of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> and the choice of Medina, transformed the citizen into a prince, the humble preacher into the leader of armies; but his sword was consecrated by the example of the saints; and the same God who afflicts a sinful world with pestilence and earthquakes, might inspire for their conversion or chastisement the valour of his servants.
 In the exercise of political government, he was compelled to abate of the stern rigour of fanaticism, to comply in some measure with the prejudices and passions of his followers, and to employ even the vices of mankind as the instruments of their salvation.
 The use of fraud and perfidy, of cruelty and injustice, were often subservient to the propagation of the faith; and <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> commanded or approved the assassination of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and idolaters who had escaped from the field of battle.
 By the repetition of such acts, the character of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> must have been gradually stained; and the influence of such pernicious habits would be poorly compensated by the practice of the personal and social virtues which are necessary to maintain the reputation of a prophet among his sectaries and friends.
 Of his last years, ambition was the ruling passion; and a politician will suspect, that he secretly smiled (the victorious impostor!) at the enthusiasm of his youth, and the credulity of his proselytes.
 (156) A philosopher will observe, that their credulity and his success would tend more strongly to fortify the assurance of his divine mission, that his interest and religion were inseparably connected, and that his conscience would be soothed by the persuasion, that he alone was absolved by the Deity from the obligation of positive and moral laws.
 If he retained any vestige of his native innocence, the sins of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> may be allowed as an evidence of his sincerity.
 In the support of truth, the arts of fraud and fiction may be deemed less criminal; and he would have started at the foulness of the means, had he not been satisfied of the importance and justice of the end.
 Even in a conqueror or a priest, I can surprise a word or action of unaffected humanity; and the decree of Mahomet, that, in the sale of captives, the mothers should never be separated from their children, may suspend, or moderate, the censure of the historian.
 (157) Private life of Mahomet, A.
D.
 632, June 7.
 The good sense of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> (158) despised the pomp of royalty: the apostle of God submitted to the menial offices of the family: he kindled the fire, swept the floor, milked the ewes, and mended with his own hands his shoes and his woollen garment.
 Disdaining the penance and merit of a hermit, he observed, without effort or vanity, the abstemious diet of an <NORP>Arab</NORP> and a soldier.
 On solemn occasions he feasted his companions with rustic and hospitable plenty; but in his domestic life, many weeks would elapse without a fire being kindled on the hearth of the prophet.
 The interdiction of wine was confirmed by his example; his hunger was appeased with a sparing allowance of barley-bread: he delighted in the taste of milk and honey; but his ordinary food consisted of dates and water.
 Perfumes and women were the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sensual enjoyments which his nature required, and his religion did not forbid; and <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> affirmed, that the fervour of his devotion was increased by these innocent pleasures.
 The heat of the climate inflames the blood of the Arabs; and their libidinous complexion has been noticed by the writers of antiquity.
 (159) Their incontinence was regulated by the civil and religious laws of the Koran: their incestuous alliances were blamed; the boundless license of polygamy was reduced to <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> legitimate wives or concubines; their rights both of bed and of dowry were equitably determined; the freedom of divorce was discouraged, adultery was condemned as a capital offence; and fornication, in either sex, was punished with a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> stripes.
 (160) Such were the calm and rational precepts of the legislator: but in his private conduct, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> indulged the appetites of a man, and abused the claims of a prophet.
 A special revelation dispensed him from the laws which he had imposed on his nation: the female sex, without reserve, was abandoned to his desires; and this singular prerogative excited the envy, rather than the scandal, the veneration, rather than the envy, of the devout Mussulmans.
 His wives.
 If we remember the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> wives and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> concubines of the wise Solomon, we shall applaud the modesty of the Arabian, who espoused no more than <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> wives; <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> are enumerated who occupied at <GPE>Medina</GPE> their separate apartments round the house of the apostle, and enjoyed in their turns the favour of his conjugal society.
 What is singular enough, they were all widows, excepting only Ayesha, the daughter of Abubeker.
 She was doubtless a virgin, since <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> consummated his nuptials (such is the premature ripeness of the climate) when she was only <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> years of age.
 The youth, the beauty, the spirit of Ayesha, gave her a superior ascendant: she was beloved and trusted by the prophet; and, after his death, the daughter of <PERSON>Abubeker</PERSON> was long revered as the mother of the faithful.
 Her behaviour had been ambiguous and indiscreet: in a nocturnal march she was accidentally left behind; and in the morning <PERSON>Ayesha</PERSON> returned to the camp with a man.
 The temper of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was inclined to jealousy; but a divine revelation assured him of her innocence: he chastised her accusers, and published a law of domestic peace, that no woman should be condemned unless <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> male witnesses had seen her in the act of adultery.
 (161) In his adventures with Zeineb, the wife of Zeid, and with Mary, an <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> captive, the amorous prophet forgot the interest of his reputation.
 At the house of Zeid, his freedman and adopted son, he beheld, in a loose undress, the beauty of Zeineb, and burst forth into an ejaculation of devotion and desire.
 The servile, or grateful, freedman understood the hint, and yielded without hesitation to the love of his benefactor.
 But as the filial relation had excited some doubt and scandal, the angel <PERSON>Gabriel</PERSON> descended from heaven to ratify the deed, to annul the adoption, and gently to reprove the apostle for distrusting the indulgence of his God.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of his wives, Hafna, the daughter of Omar, surprised him on her own bed, in the embraces of his <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> captive: she promised secrecy and forgiveness, he swore that he would renounce the possession of Mary.
 Both parties forgot their engagements; and <PERSON>Gabriel</PERSON> again descended with a chapter of the Koran, to absolve him from his oath, and to exhort him freely to enjoy his captives and concubines, without listening to the clamours of his wives.
 In a solitary retreat of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> days, he labored, alone with Mary, to fulfil the commands of the angel.
 When his love and revenge were satiated, he summoned to his presence his <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> wives, reproached their disobedience and indiscretion, and threatened them with a sentence of divorce, both in this world and in the next; a dreadful sentence, since those who had ascended the bed of the prophet were forever excluded from the hope of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> marriage.
 Perhaps the incontinence of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> may be palliated by the tradition of his natural or preternatural gifts; (162) he united the manly virtue of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> of the children of Adam: and the apostle might rival the <ORDINAL>thirteenth</ORDINAL> labour (163) of the Grecian Hercules.
 (164) A more serious and decent excuse may be drawn from his fidelity to Cadijah.
 During the <CARDINAL>twenty-four</CARDINAL> years of their marriage, her youthful husband abstained from the right of polygamy, and the pride or tenderness of the venerable matron was never insulted by the society of a rival.
 After her death, he placed her in the rank of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> perfect women, with the sister of Moses, the mother of Jesus, and Fatima, the best beloved of his daughters.
 and children.
 In the largest indulgence of polygamy, the founder of a religion and empire might aspire to multiply the chances of a numerous posterity and a lineal succession.
 The hopes of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> were fatally disappointed.
 The virgin Ayesha, and his <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> widows of mature age and approved fertility, were barren in his potent embraces.
 The <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> sons of <PERSON>Cadijah</PERSON> died in their infancy.
 Mary, his <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> concubine, was endeared to him by the birth of Ibrahim.
 At the end of <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> <DATE>months</DATE> the prophet wept over his grave; but he sustained with firmness the raillery of his enemies, and checked the adulation or credulity of the Moslems, by the assurance that an eclipse of the sun was not occasioned by the death of the infant.
 <PERSON>Cadijah</PERSON> had likewise given him <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> daughters, who were married to the most faithful of his disciples: the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> eldest died before their father; but Fatima, who possessed his confidence and love, became the wife of her cousin Ali, and the mother of an illustrious progeny.
 The merit and misfortunes of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> and his descendants will lead me to anticipate, in this place, the series of the <NORP>Saracen</NORP> caliphs, a title which describes the commanders of the faithful as the vicars and successors of the apostle of God.
 (166) Character of Ali.
 The birth, the alliance, the character of Ali, which exalted him above the rest of his countrymen, might justify his claim to the vacant throne of Arabia.
 The son of Abu Taleb was, in his own right, the chief of the family of Hashem, and the hereditary prince or guardian of the city and temple of Mecca.
 The light of prophecy was extinct; but the husband of <PERSON>Fatima</PERSON> might expect the inheritance and blessing of her father: the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> had sometimes been patient of a female reign; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> grandsons of the prophet had often been fondled in his lap, and shown in his pulpit as the hope of his age, and the chief of the youth of paradise.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the true believers might aspire to march before them in this world and in the next; and if some were of a graver and more rigid cast, the zeal and virtue of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> were never outstripped by any recent proselyte.
 He united the qualifications of a poet, a soldier, and a saint: his wisdom still breathes in a collection of moral and religious sayings; (167) and every antagonist, in the combats of the tongue or of the sword, was subdued by his eloquence and valour.
 From the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> hour of his mission to the last rites of his funeral, the apostle was never forsaken by a generous friend, whom he delighted to name his brother, his vicegerent, and the faithful <PERSON>Aaron</PERSON> of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Moses.
 The son of Abu Taleb was afterwards reproached for neglecting to secure his interest by a solemn declaration of his right, which would have silenced all competition, and sealed his succession by the decrees of Heaven.
 But the unsuspecting hero confided in himself: the jealousy of empire, and perhaps the fear of opposition, might suspend the resolutions of Mahomet; and the bed of sickness was besieged by the artful Ayesha, the daughter of Abubeker, and the enemy of Ali.
 Reign of Abubeker; A.
D.
 632, June 7.
 The silence and death of the prophet restored the liberty of the people; and his companions convened an assembly to deliberate on the choice of his successor.
 The hereditary claim and lofty spirit of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> were offensive to an aristocracy of elders, desirous of bestowing and resuming the sceptre by a free and frequent election: the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> could never be reconciled to the proud preeminence of the line of Hashem; the ancient discord of the tribes was rekindled, the fugitives of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> and the auxiliaries of <GPE>Medina</GPE> asserted their respective merits; and the rash proposal of choosing <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> independent caliphs would have crushed in their infancy the religion and empire of the Saracens.
 The tumult was appeased by the disinterested resolution of Omar, who, suddenly renouncing his own pretensions, stretched forth his hand, and declared himself the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> subject of the mild and venerable Abubeker.
 The urgency of the moment, and the acquiescence of the people, might excuse this illegal and precipitate measure; but <PERSON>Omar</PERSON> himself confessed from the pulpit, that if any <PERSON>Mulsulman</PERSON> should hereafter presume to anticipate the suffrage of his brethren, both the elector and the elected would be worthy of death.
 (168) After the simple inauguration of Abubeker, he was obeyed in Medina, Mecca, and the provinces of Arabia: the <NORP>Hashemites</NORP> alone declined the oath of fidelity; and their chief, in his own house, maintained, above <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months, a sullen and independent reserve; without listening to the threats of Omar, who attempted to consume with fire the habitation of the daughter of the apostle.
 The death of Fatima, and the decline of his party, subdued the indignant spirit of Ali: he condescended to salute the commander of the faithful, accepted his excuse of the necessity of preventing their common enemies, and wisely rejected his courteous offer of abdicating the government of the Arabians.
 After a reign of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years, the aged caliph was summoned by the angel of death.
 In his testament, with the tacit approbation of his companions, he bequeathed the sceptre to the firm and intrepid virtue of Omar.
 replied Abubeker; who expired with a fervent prayer, of Omar, A.
D.
 634, July 24.
 that the God of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> would ratify his choice, and direct the <NORP>Mussulmans</NORP> in the way of concord and obedience.
 The prayer was not ineffectual, since <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> himself, in a life of privacy and prayer, professed to revere the superior worth and dignity of his rival; who comforted him for the loss of empire, by the most flattering marks of confidence and esteem.
 In the <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> year of his reign, <PERSON>Omar</PERSON> received a mortal wound from the hand of an assassin: he rejected with equal impartiality the names of his son and of Ali, refused to load his conscience with the sins of his successor, and devolved on <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> of the most respectable companions the arduous task of electing a commander of the faithful.
 On this occasion, <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> was again blamed by his friends (169) for submitting his right to the judgment of men, for recognizing their jurisdiction by accepting a place among the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> electors.
 He might have obtained their suffrage, had he deigned to promise a strict and servile conformity, not only to the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> and tradition, but likewise to the determinations of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> seniors.
 of Othman, A.
D.
 644, November 6.
 (170) With these limitations, Othman, the secretary of Mahomet, accepted the government; nor was it till after the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> caliph, <CARDINAL>twenty-four</CARDINAL> years after the death of the prophet, that <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> was invested, by the popular choice, with the regal and sacerdotal office.
 The manners of the <NORP>Arabians</NORP> retained their primitive simplicity, and the son of Abu Taleb despised the pomp and vanity of this world.
 At the hour of prayer, he repaired to the mosch of Medina, clothed in a thin cotton gown, a coarse turban on his head, his slippers in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hand, and his bow in the other, instead of a walking-staff.
 The companions of the prophet, and the chiefs of the tribes, saluted their new sovereign, and gave him their right hands as a sign of fealty and allegiance.
 Discord of the <NORP>Turks</NORP> and Persians.
 The mischiefs that flow from the contests of ambition are usually confined to the times and countries in which they have been agitated.
 But the religious discord of the friends and enemies of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> has been renewed in every age of the Hegira, and is still maintained in the immortal hatred of the <NORP>Persians</NORP> and Turks.
 (171) The former, who are branded with the appellation of <NORP>Shiites</NORP> or sectaries, have enriched the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> creed with a new article of faith; and if <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> be the apostle, his companion <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> is the vicar, of God.
 In their private converse, in their public worship, they bitterly execrate the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> usurpers who intercepted his indefeasible right to the dignity of <PERSON>Imam</PERSON> and Caliph; and the name of <PERSON>Omar</PERSON> expresses in their tongue the perfect accomplishment of wickedness and impiety.
 (172) The Sonnites, who are supported by the general consent and orthodox tradition of the Mussulmans, entertain a more impartial, or at least a more decent, opinion.
 They respect the memory of Abubeker, Omar, Othman, and Ali, the holy and legitimate successors of the prophet.
 But they assign the last and most humble place to the husband of Fatima, in the persuasion that the order of succession was determined by the decrees of sanctity.
 (173) An historian who balances the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> caliphs with a hand unshaken by superstition, will calmly pronounce that their manners were alike pure and exemplary; that their zeal was fervent, and probably sincere; and that, in the midst of riches and power, their lives were devoted to the practice of moral and religious duties.
 But the public virtues of <PERSON>Abubeker</PERSON> and Omar, the prudence of the first, the severity of the second, maintained the peace and prosperity of their reigns.
 The feeble temper and declining age of <PERSON>Othman</PERSON> were incapable of sustaining the weight of conquest and empire.
 He chose, and he was deceived; he trusted, and he was betrayed: the most deserving of the faithful became useless or hostile to his government, and his lavish bounty was productive only of ingratitude and discontent.
 The spirit of discord went forth in the provinces: their deputies assembled at Medina; and the Charegites, the desperate fanatics who disclaimed the yoke of subordination and reason, were confounded among the free-born Arabs, who demanded the redress of their wrongs and the punishment of their oppressors.
 From Cufa, from Bassora, from Egypt, from the tribes of the desert, they rose in arms, encamped about a league from Medina, and despatched a haughty mandate to their sovereign, requiring him to execute justice, or to descend from the throne.
 His repentance began to disarm and disperse the insurgents; but their fury was rekindled by the arts of his enemies; and the forgery of a perfidious secretary was contrived to blast his reputation and precipitate his fall.
 The caliph had lost the only guard of his predecessors, the esteem and confidence of the Moslems: during a siege of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> weeks his water and provisions were intercepted, and the feeble gates of the palace were protected only by the scruples of the more timorous rebels.
 Forsaken by those who had abused his simplicity, the hopeless and venerable caliph expected the approach of death: the brother of <PERSON>Ayesha</PERSON> marched at the head of the assassins; Death of Othman, A.
D.
 655, June 18.
 and Othman, with the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> in his lap, was pierced with a multitude of wounds.
 A tumultuous anarchy of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> days was appeased by the inauguration of Ali: his refusal would have provoked a general massacre.
 In this painful situation he supported the becoming pride of the chief of the Hashemites; declared that he had rather serve than reign; rebuked the presumption of the strangers; and required the formal, if not the voluntary, assent of the chiefs of the nation.
 He has never been accused of prompting the assassin of Omar; though <GPE>Persia</GPE> indiscreetly celebrates the festival of that holy martyr.
 The quarrel between <PERSON>Othman</PERSON> and his subjects was assuaged by the early mediation of Ali; and Hassan, the eldest of his sons, was insulted and wounded in the defence of the caliph.
 Yet it is doubtful whether the father of <PERSON>Hassan</PERSON> was strenuous and sincere in his opposition to the rebels; and it is certain that he enjoyed the benefit of their crime.
 The temptation was indeed of such magnitude as might stagger and corrupt the most obdurate virtue.
 The ambitious candidate no longer aspired to the barren sceptre of Arabia; the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> had been victorious in the <LOC>East</LOC> and West; and the wealthy kingdoms of Persia, Syria, and <GPE>Egypt</GPE> were the patrimony of the commander of the faithful.
 Reign of Ali, A.
D.
 655-660.
 A life of prayer and contemplation had not chilled the martial activity of Ali; but in a mature age, after a long experience of mankind, he still betrayed in his conduct the rashness and indiscretion of youth.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of his reign, he neglected to secure, either by gifts or fetters, the doubtful allegiance of <PERSON>Telha</PERSON> and Zobeir, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of the most powerful of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> chiefs.
 They escaped from <GPE>Medina</GPE> to Mecca, and from thence to Bassora; erected the standard of revolt; and usurped the government of Irak, or Assyria, which they had vainly solicited as the reward of their services.
 The mask of patriotism is allowed to cover the most glaring inconsistencies; and the enemies, perhaps the assassins, of <PERSON>Othman</PERSON> now demanded vengeance for his blood.
 They were accompanied in their flight by Ayesha, the widow of the prophet, who cherished, to the last hour of her life, an implacable hatred against the husband and the posterity of Fatima.
 The most reasonable <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were scandalized, that the mother of the faithful should expose in a camp her person and character; but the superstitious crowd was confident that her presence would sanctify the justice, and assure the success, of their cause.
 At the head of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> of his loyal Arabs, and <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> valiant auxiliaries of Cufa, the caliph encountered and defeated the superior numbers of the rebels under the walls of Bassora.
 Their leaders, <PERSON>Telha</PERSON> and Zobeir, were slain in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> battle that stained with civil blood the arms of the Moslems.
 After passing through the ranks to animate the troops, <PERSON>Ayesha</PERSON> had chosen her post amidst the dangers of the field.
 In the heat of the action, <CARDINAL>seventy</CARDINAL> men, who held the bridle of her camel, were successively killed or wounded; and the cage or litter, in which she sat, was stuck with javelins and darts like the quills of a porcupine.
 The venerable captive sustained with firmness the reproaches of the conqueror, and was speedily dismissed to her proper station at the tomb of Mahomet, with the respect and tenderness that was still due to the widow of the apostle.
 After this victory, which was styled the Day of the Camel, <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> marched against a more formidable adversary; against Moawiyah, the son of Abu Sophian, who had assumed the title of caliph, and whose claim was supported by the forces of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and the interest of the house of Ommiyah.
 From the passage of Thapsacus, the plain of <GPE>Siffin</GPE> (174) extends along the western bank of the Euphrates.
 On this spacious and level theatre, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> competitors waged a desultory war of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> days.
 In the course of <CARDINAL>ninety</CARDINAL> actions or skirmishes, the loss of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> was estimated at twenty-five, that of <GPE>Moawiyah</GPE> at forty-five, <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> soldiers; and the list of the slain was dignified with the names of <CARDINAL>five-and-twenty</CARDINAL> veterans who had fought at <ORG>Beder</ORG> under the standard of Mahomet.
 In this sanguinary contest the lawful caliph displayed a superior character of valour and humanity.
 His troops were strictly enjoined to await the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset of the enemy, to spare their flying brethren, and to respect the bodies of the dead, and the chastity of the female captives.
 He generously proposed to save the blood of the <NORP>Moslems</NORP> by a single combat; but his trembling rival declined the challenge as a sentence of inevitable death.
 The ranks of the <NORP>Syrians</NORP> were broken by the charge of a hero who was mounted on a piebald horse, and wielded with irresistible force his ponderous and two-edged sword.
 As often as he smote a rebel, he shouted the Allah Acbar, "God is victorious!" and in the tumult of a nocturnal battle, he was heard to repeat <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> times that tremendous exclamation.
 The prince of <GPE>Damascus</GPE> already meditated his flight; but the certain victory was snatched from the grasp of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> by the disobedience and enthusiasm of his troops.
 Their conscience was awed by the solemn appeal to the books of the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> which <GPE>Moawiyah</GPE> exposed on the foremost lances; and <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> was compelled to yield to a disgraceful truce and an insidious compromise.
 He retreated with sorrow and indignation to Cufa; his party was discouraged; the distant provinces of Persia, of Yemen, and of Egypt, were subdued or seduced by his crafty rival; and the stroke of fanaticism, which was aimed against the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> chiefs of the nation, was fatal only to the cousin of Mahomet.
 In the temple of Mecca, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <NORP>Charegites</NORP> or enthusiasts discoursed of the disorders of the church and state: they soon agreed, that the deaths of Ali, of Moawiyah, and of his friend Amrou, the viceroy of Egypt, would restore the peace and unity of religion.
 Each of the assassins chose his victim, poisoned his dagger, devoted his life, and secretly repaired to the scene of action.
 Their resolution was equally desperate: but the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> mistook the person of Amrou, and stabbed the deputy who occupied his seat; the prince of <GPE>Damascus</GPE> was dangerously hurt by the second; the lawful caliph, in the mosch of Cufa, received a mortal wound from the hand of the third.
 He expired in the sixty-third year of his age, and mercifully recommended to his children, that they would despatch the murderer by a single stroke.
 The sepulchre of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> (175) was concealed from the tyrants of the house of Ommiyah; (176) but in the fourth age of the Hegira, a tomb, a temple, a city, arose near the ruins of Cufa.
 (177) Many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Shiites</NORP> repose in holy ground at the feet of the vicar of God; and the desert is vivified by the numerous and <DATE>annual</DATE> visits of the Persians, who esteem their devotion not less meritorious than the pilgrimage of Mecca.
 Reign of Moawiyah, A.
D.
 655, or 661-680.
 The persecutors of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> usurped the inheritance of his children; and the champions of idolatry became the supreme heads of his religion and empire.
 The opposition of Abu Sophian had been fierce and obstinate; his conversion was tardy and reluctant; his new faith was fortified by necessity and interest; he served, he fought, perhaps he believed; and the sins of the time of ignorance were expiated by the recent merits of the family of Ommiyah.
 Moawiyah, the son of Abu Sophian, and of the cruel Henda, was dignified, in his early youth, with the office or title of secretary of the prophet: the judgment of <PERSON>Omar</PERSON> entrusted him with the government of Syria; and he administered that important province above <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> years, either in a subordinate or supreme rank.
 Without renouncing the fame of valour and liberality, he affected the reputation of humanity and moderation: a grateful people was attached to their benefactor; and the victorious <NORP>Moslems</NORP> were enriched with the spoils of <GPE>Cyprus</GPE> and Rhodes.
 The sacred duty of pursuing the assassins of <PERSON>Othman</PERSON> was the engine and pretence of his ambition.
 The bloody shirt of the martyr was exposed in the mosch of Damascus: the emir deplored the fate of his injured kinsman; and sixty <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Syrians</NORP> were engaged in his service by an oath of fidelity and revenge.
 Amrou, the conqueror of Egypt, himself an army, was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who saluted the new monarch, and divulged the dangerous secret, that the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> caliphs might be created elsewhere than in the city of the prophet.
 (178) The policy of <GPE>Moawiyah</GPE> eluded the valour of his rival; and, after the death of Ali, he negotiated the abdication of his son Hassan, whose mind was either above or below the government of the world, and who retired without a sigh from the palace of <GPE>Cufa</GPE> to an humble cell near the tomb of his grandfather.
 The aspiring wishes of the caliph were finally crowned by the important change of an elective to an hereditary kingdom.
 Some murmurs of freedom or fanaticism attested the reluctance of the Arabs, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> citizens of <GPE>Medina</GPE> refused the oath of fidelity; but the designs of <GPE>Moawiyah</GPE> were conducted with vigour and address; and his son Yezid, a feeble and dissolute youth, was proclaimed as the commander of the faithful and the successor on the apostle of God.
 Death of Hosein, A.
D.
 680, October 10.
 A familiar story is related of the benevolence of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the sons of Ali.
 In serving at table, a slave had inadvertently dropped a dish of scalding broth on his master: the heedless wretch fell prostrate, to deprecate his punishment, and repeated a verse of the Koran: With an equal measure of piety, Hosein, the younger brother of Hassan, inherited a remnant of his father's spirit, and served with honour against the <NORP>Christians</NORP> in the siege of Constantinople.
 The primogeniture of the line of Hashem, and the holy character of grandson of the apostle, had centred in his person, and he was at liberty to prosecute his claim against Yezid, the tyrant of Damascus, whose vices he despised, and whose title he had never deigned to acknowledge.
 A list was secretly transmitted from <GPE>Cufa</GPE> to Medina, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Moslems, who professed their attachment to his cause, and who were eager to draw their swords so soon as he should appear on the banks of the Euphrates.
 Against the advice of his wisest friends, he resolved to trust his person and family in the hands of a perfidious people.
 He traversed the desert of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> with a timorous retinue of women and children; but as he approached the confines of <PERSON>Irak</PERSON> he was alarmed by the solitary or hostile face of the country, and suspected either the defection or ruin of his party.
 His fears were just: Obeidollah, the governor of Cufa, had extinguished the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> sparks of an insurrection; and Hosein, in the plain of Kerbela, was encompassed by a body of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse, who intercepted his communication with the city and the river.
 He might still have escaped to a fortress in the desert, that had defied the power of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Chosroes, and confided in the fidelity of the tribe of Tai, which would have armed <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> warriors in his defence.
 In a conference with the chief of the enemy, he proposed the option of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> honourable conditions: that he should be allowed to return to Medina, or be stationed in a frontier garrison against the Turks, or safely conducted to the presence of Yezid.
 But the commands of the caliph, or his lieutenant, were stern and absolute; and <PERSON>Hosein</PERSON> was informed that he must either submit as a captive and a criminal to the commander of the faithful, or expect the consequences of his rebellion.
 And, during the short respite of a night, he prepared with calm and solemn resignation to encounter his fate.
 He checked the lamentations of his sister Fatima, who deplored the impending ruin of his house.
 He pressed his friends to consult their safety by a timely flight: they unanimously refused to desert or survive their beloved master: and their courage was fortified by a fervent prayer and the assurance of paradise.
 On the morning of the fatal day, he mounted on horseback, with his sword in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hand and the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> in the other: his generous band of martyrs consisted only of <CARDINAL>thirty-two</CARDINAL> horse and <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> foot; but their flanks and rear were secured by the tent-ropes, and by a deep trench which they had filled with lighted fagots, according to the practice of the Arabs.
 The enemy advanced with reluctance, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their chiefs deserted, with <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> followers, to claim the partnership of inevitable death.
 In every close onset, or single combat, the despair of the <NORP>Fatimites</NORP> was invincible; but the surrounding multitudes galled them from a distance with a cloud of arrows, and the horses and men were successively slain; a truce was allowed on both sides for the hour of prayer; and the battle at length expired by the death of the last companions of Hosein.
 Alone, weary, and wounded, he seated himself at the door of his tent.
 As he tasted a drop of water, he was pierced in the mouth with a dart; and his son and nephew, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> beautiful youths, were killed in his arms.
 He lifted his hands to heaven; they were full of blood; and he uttered a funeral prayer for the living and the dead.
 In a transport of despair his sister issued from the tent, and adjured the general of the Cufians, that he would not suffer <PERSON>Hosein</PERSON> to be murdered before his eyes: a tear trickled down his venerable beard; and the boldest of his soldiers fell back on every side as the dying hero threw himself among them.
 The remorseless Shamer, a name detested by the faithful, reproached their cowardice; and the grandson of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was slain with <CARDINAL>three-and-thirty</CARDINAL> strokes of lances and swords.
 After they had trampled on his body, they carried his head to the castle of Cufa, and the inhuman <PERSON>Obeidollah</PERSON> struck him on the mouth with a cane: In a distant age and climate, the tragic scene of the death of <PERSON>Hosein</PERSON> will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader.
 (179) On the <DATE>annual</DATE> festival of his martyrdom, in the devout pilgrimage to his sepulchre, his <NORP>Persian</NORP> votaries abandon their souls to the religious frenzy of sorrow and indignation.
 (180) Posterity of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> and Ali.
 When the sisters and children of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> were brought in chains to the throne of Damascus, the caliph was advised to extirpate the enmity of a popular and hostile race, whom he had injured beyond the hope of reconciliation.
 But <PERSON>Yezid</PERSON> preferred the councils of mercy; and the mourning family was honourably dismissed to mingle their tears with their kindred at Medina.
 The glory of martyrdom superseded the right of primogeniture; and the <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> IMAMS, (181) or pontiffs, of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> creed, are Ali, Hassan, Hosein, and the lineal descendants of <PERSON>Hosein</PERSON> to the <ORDINAL>ninth</ORDINAL> generation.
 Without arms, or treasures, or subjects, they successively enjoyed the veneration of the people, and provoked the jealousy of the reigning caliphs: their tombs, at <GPE>Mecca</GPE> or Medina, on the banks of the Euphrates, or in the province of Chorasan, are still visited by the devotion of their sect.
 Their names were often the pretence of sedition and civil war; but these royal saints despised the pomp of the world: submitted to the will of God and the injustice of man; and devoted their innocent lives to the study and practice of religion.
 The <ORDINAL>twelfth</ORDINAL> and last of the Imams, conspicuous by the title of Mahadi, or the Guide, surpassed the solitude and sanctity of his predecessors.
 He concealed himself in a cavern near Bagdad: the time and place of his death are unknown; and his votaries pretend that he still lives, and will appear before the <DATE>day</DATE> of judgment to overthrow the tyranny of Dejal, or the Antichrist.
 (182) In the lapse of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> centuries, the posterity of Abbas, the uncle of Mahomet, had multiplied to the number of thirty-three thousand: (183) the race of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> might be equally prolific: the meanest individual was above the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and greatest of princes; and the most eminent were supposed to excel the perfection of angels.
 But their adverse fortune, and the wide extent of the <NORP>Mussulman</NORP> empire, allowed an ample scope for every bold and artful imposture, who claimed affinity with the holy seed: the sceptre of the Almohades, in <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Africa; of the Fatimites, in <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Syria; (184) of the <NORP>Sultans</NORP> of Yemen; and of the Sophis of Persia; (185) has been consecrated by this vague and ambiguous title.
 Under their reigns it might be dangerous to dispute the legitimacy of their birth; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Fatimite</NORP> caliphs silenced an indiscreet question by drawing his cimeter: In the various conditions of princes, or doctors, or nobles, or merchants, or beggars, a swarm of the genuine or fictitious descendants of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> is honoured with the appellation of sheiks, or sherifs, or emirs.
 In the <NORP>Ottoman</NORP> empire they are distinguished by a green turban; receive a stipend from the treasury; are judged only by their chief; and, however debased by fortune or character, still assert the proud preeminence of their birth.
 A family of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> persons, the pure and orthodox branch of the caliph Hassan, is preserved without taint or suspicion in the holy cities of <GPE>Mecca</GPE> and Medina, and still retains, after the revolutions of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> centuries, the custody of the temple, and the sovereignty of their native land.
 The fame and merit of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> would ennoble a plebeian race, and the ancient blood of the <NORP>Koreish</NORP> transcends the recent majesty of the kings of the earth.
 (186) Success of Mahomet.
 The talents of <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> are entitled to our applause; but his success has, perhaps, too strongly attracted our admiration.
 Are we surprised that a multitude of proselytes should embrace the doctrine and the passions of an eloquent fanatic? In the heresies of the church, the same seduction has been tried and repeated from the time of the apostles to that of the reformers.
 Does it seem incredible that a private citizen should grasp the sword and the sceptre, subdue his native country, and erect a monarchy by his victorious arms? In the moving picture of the dynasties of the East, a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> fortunate usurpers have arisen from a baser origin, surmounted more formidable obstacles, and filled a larger scope of empire and conquest.
 <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was alike instructed to preach and to fight; and the union of these opposite qualities, while it enhanced his merit, contributed to his success: the operation of force and persuasion, of enthusiasm and fear, continually acted on each other, till every barrier yielded to their irresistible power.
 His voice invited the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> to freedom and victory, to arms and rapine, to the indulgence of their darling passions in this world and the other: the restraints which he imposed were requisite to establish the credit of the prophet, and to exercise the obedience of the people; and the only objection to his success was his rational creed of the unity and perfections of God.
 Permanency of his religion.
 It is not the propagation, but the permanency, of his religion, that deserves our wonder: the same pure and perfect impression which he engraved at <GPE>Mecca</GPE> and Medina, is preserved, after the revolutions of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> centuries, by the Indian, the African, and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> proselytes of the Koran.
 If the <NORP>Christian</NORP> apostles, St.
 Peter or St.
 Paul, could return to the Vatican, they might possibly inquire the name of the Deity who is worshipped with such mysterious rites in that magnificent temple: at <GPE>Oxford</GPE> or Geneva, they would experience less surprise; but it might still be incumbent on them to peruse the catechism of the church, and to study the orthodox commentators on their own writings and the words of their Master.
 But the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> dome of St.
 Sophia, with an increase of splendour and size, represents the humble tabernacle erected at <GPE>Medina</GPE> by the hands of Mahomet.
 The <NORP>Mahometans</NORP> have uniformly withstood the temptation of reducing the object of their faith and devotion to a level with the senses and imagination of man.
 "I believe in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> God, and <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> the apostle of God," is the simple and invariable profession of Islam.
 The intellectual image of the Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol; the honours of the prophet have never transgressed the measure of human virtue; and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of reason and religion.
 The votaries of <PERSON>Ali</PERSON> have, indeed, consecrated the memory of their hero, his wife, and his children; and some of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> doctors pretend that the divine essence was incarnate in the person of the Imams; but their superstition is universally condemned by the Sonnites; and their impiety has afforded a seasonable warning against the worship of saints and martyrs.
 The metaphysical questions on the attributes of God, and the liberty of man, have been agitated in the schools of the Mahometans, as well as in those of the Christians; but among the former they have never engaged the passions of the people, or disturbed the tranquillity of the state.
 The cause of this important difference may be found in the separation or union of the regal and sacerdotal characters.
 It was the interest of the caliphs, the successors of the prophet and commanders of the faithful, to repress and discourage all religious innovations: the order, the discipline, the temporal and spiritual ambition of the clergy, are unknown to the Moslems; and the sages of the law are the guides of their conscience and the oracles of their faith.
 From the <LOC>Atlantic</LOC> to the Ganges, the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> is acknowledged as the fundamental code, not only of theology, but of civil and criminal jurisprudence; and the laws which regulate the actions and the property of mankind are guarded by the infallible and immutable sanction of the will of God.
 This religious servitude is attended with some practical disadvantage; the illiterate legislator had been often misled by his own prejudices and those of his country; and the institutions of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> desert may be ill adapted to the wealth and numbers of <NORP>Ispahan</NORP> and Constantinople.
 On these occasions, the <PERSON>Cadhi</PERSON> respectfully places on his head the holy volume, and substitutes a dexterous interpretation more apposite to the principles of equity, and the manners and policy of the times.
 His merit towards his country.
 His beneficial or pernicious influence on the public happiness is the last consideration in the character of Mahomet.
 The most bitter or most bigoted of his <NORP>Christian</NORP> or <NORP>Jewish</NORP> foes will surely allow that he assumed a false commission to inculcate a salutary doctrine, less perfect only than their own.
 He piously supposed, as the basis of his religion, the truth and sanctity of their prior revolutions, the virtues and miracles of their founders.
 The idols of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> were broken before the throne of God; the blood of human victims was expiated by prayer, and fasting, and alms, the laudable or innocent arts of devotion; and his rewards and punishments of a future life were painted by the images most congenial to an ignorant and carnal generation.
 <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> was, perhaps, incapable of dictating a moral and political system for the use of his countrymen: but he breathed among the faithful a spirit of charity and friendship; recommended the practice of the social virtues; and checked, by his laws and precepts, the thirst of revenge, and the oppression of widows and orphans.
 The hostile tribes were united in faith and obedience, and the valour which had been idly spent in domestic quarrels was vigorously directed against a foreign enemy.
 Had the impulse been less powerful, Arabia, free at home and formidable abroad, might have flourished under a succession of her native monarchs.
 Her sovereignty was lost by the extent and rapidity of conquest.
 The colonies of the nation were scattered over the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, and their blood was mingled with the blood of their converts and captives.
 After the reign of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> caliphs, the throne was transported from <GPE>Medina</GPE> to the valley of <GPE>Damascus</GPE> and the banks of the Tigris; the holy cities were violated by impious war; <GPE>Arabia</GPE> was ruled by the rod of a subject, perhaps of a stranger; and the <NORP>Bedoweens</NORP> of the desert, awakening from their dream of dominion, resumed their old and solitary independence.
