 Introduction of images into the <NORP>Christian</NORP> church.
 In the connection of the church and state, I have considered the former as subservient only, and relative, to the latter; a salutary maxim, if in fact, as well as in narrative, it had ever been held sacred.
 The <NORP>Oriental</NORP> philosophy of the Gnostics, the dark abyss of predestination and grace, and the strange transformation of the Eucharist from the sign to the substance of Christ's body, (1) I have purposely abandoned to the curiosity of speculative divines.
 But I have reviewed, with diligence and pleasure, the objects of ecclesiastical history, by which the decline and fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire were materially affected, the propagation of Christianity, the constitution of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church, the ruin of Paganism, and the sects that arose from the mysterious controversies concerning the <FAC>Trinity</FAC> and incarnation.
 At the head of this class, we may justly rank the worship of images, so fiercely disputed in the eighth and ninth centuries; since a question of popular superstition produced the revolt of Italy, the temporal power of the popes, and the restoration of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire in the West.
 The primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> were possessed with an unconquerable repugnance to the use and abuse of images; and this aversion may be ascribed to their descent from the Jews, and their enmity to the Greeks.
 The <ORG>Mosaic</ORG> law had severely proscribed all representations of the Deity; and that precept was firmly established in the principles and practice of the chosen people.
 The wit of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> apologists was pointed against the foolish idolaters, who bowed before the workmanship of their own hands; the images of brass and marble, which, had they been endowed with sense and motion, should have started rather from the pedestal to adore the creative powers of the artist.
 (2) Perhaps some recent and imperfect converts of the <NORP>Gnostic</NORP> tribe might crown the statues of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and St.
 Paul with the profane honours which they paid to those of <PERSON>Aristotle</PERSON> and Pythagoras; (3) but the public religion of the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> was uniformly simple and spiritual; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> notice of the use of pictures is in the censure of the council of Illiberis, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years after the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aera.
 Under the successors of Constantine, in the peace and luxury of the triumphant church, the more prudent bishops condescended to indulge a visible superstition, for the benefit of the multitude; and, after the ruin of Paganism, they were no longer restrained by the apprehension of an odious parallel.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> introduction of a symbolic worship was in the veneration of the cross, and of relics.
 The saints and martyrs, whose intercession was implored, were seated on the right hand if God; but the gracious and often supernatural favours, which, in the popular belief, were showered round their tomb, conveyed an unquestionable sanction of the devout pilgrims, who visited, and touched, and kissed these lifeless remains, the memorials of their merits and sufferings.
 (4) But a memorial, more interesting than the skull or the sandals of a departed worthy, is the faithful copy of his person and features, delineated by the arts of painting or sculpture.
 In every age, such copies, so congenial to human feelings, have been cherished by the zeal of private friendship, or public esteem: the images of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors were adored with civil, and almost religious, honours; a reverence less ostentatious, but more sincere, was applied to the statues of sages and patriots; and these profane virtues, these splendid sins, disappeared in the presence of the holy men, who had died for their celestial and everlasting country.
 Their worship.
 At first, the experiment was made with caution and scruple; and the venerable pictures were discreetly allowed to instruct the ignorant, to awaken the cold, and to gratify the prejudices of the heathen proselytes.
 By a slow though inevitable progression, the honours of the original were transferred to the copy: the devout <NORP>Christian</NORP> prayed before the image of a saint; and the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> rites of genuflection, luminaries, and incense, again stole into the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 The scruples of reason, or piety, were silenced by the strong evidence of visions and miracles; and the pictures which speak, and move, and bleed, must be endowed with a divine energy, and may be considered as the proper objects of religious adoration.
 The most audacious pencil might tremble in the rash attempt of defining, by forms and colours, the infinite Spirit, the eternal Father, who pervades and sustains the universe.
 (5) But the superstitious mind was more easily reconciled to paint and to worship the angels, and, above all, the Son of God, under the human shape, which, on earth, they have condescended to assume.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> person of the <FAC>Trinity</FAC> had been clothed with a real and mortal body; but that body had ascended into heaven: and, had not some similitude been presented to the eyes of his disciples, the spiritual worship of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> might have been obliterated by the visible relics and representations of the saints.
 A similar indulgence was requisite and propitious for the <PERSON>Virgin</PERSON> Mary: the place of her burial was unknown; and the assumption of her soul and body into heaven was adopted by the credulity of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Latins.
 The use, and even the worship, of images was firmly established before the end of the sixth century: they were fondly cherished by the warm imagination of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Asiatics: the <FAC>Pantheon</FAC> and <FAC>Vatican</FAC> were adorned with the emblems of a new superstition; but this semblance of idolatry was more coldly entertained by the rude <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> and the <NORP>Arian</NORP> clergy of the West.
 The bolder forms of sculpture, in brass or marble, which peopled the temples of antiquity, were offensive to the fancy or conscience of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> Greeks: and a smooth surface of colours has ever been esteemed a more decent and harmless mode of imitation.
 (6) The image of Edessa.
 The merit and effect of a copy depends on its resemblance with the original; but the primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> were ignorant of the genuine features of the Son of God, his mother, and his apostles: the statue of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> at Paneas in <GPE>Palestine</GPE> (7) was more probably that of some temporal saviour; the <NORP>Gnostics</NORP> and their profane monuments were reprobated; and the fancy of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> artists could only be guided by the clandestine imitation of some heathen model.
 In this distress, a bold and dexterous invention assured at once the likeness of the image and the innocence of the worship.
 A new super structure of fable was raised on the popular basis of a <NORP>Syrian</NORP> legend, on the correspondence of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and Abgarus, so famous in the days of Eusebius, so reluctantly deserted by our modern advocates.
 The bishop of <GPE>Caesarea</GPE> (8) records the epistle, (9) but he most strangely forgets the picture of Christ; (10) the perfect impression of his face on a linen, with which he gratified the faith of the royal stranger who had invoked his healing power, and offered the strong city of <GPE>Edessa</GPE> to protect him against the malice of the Jews.
 The ignorance of the primitive church is explained by the long imprisonment of the image in a niche of the wall, from whence, after an oblivion of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, it was released by some prudent bishop, and seasonably presented to the devotion of the times.
 Its <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most glorious exploit was the deliverance of the city from the arms of Chosroes Nushirvan; and it was soon revered as a pledge of the divine promise, that <GPE>Edessa</GPE> should never be taken by a foreign enemy.
 It is true, indeed, that the text of <PERSON>Procopius</PERSON> ascribes the double deliverance of <GPE>Edessa</GPE> to the wealth and valour of her citizens, who purchased the absence and repelled the assaults of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch.
 He was ignorant, the profane historian, of the testimony which he is compelled to deliver in the ecclesiastical page of Evagrius, that the <FAC>Palladium</FAC> was exposed on the rampart, and that the water which had been sprinkled on the holy face, instead of quenching, added new fuel to the flames of the besieged.
 After this important service, the image of <GPE>Edessa</GPE> was preserved with respect and gratitude; and if the <NORP>Armenians</NORP> rejected the legend, the more credulous <NORP>Greeks</NORP> adored the similitude, which was not the work of any mortal pencil, but the immediate creation of the divine original.
 The style and sentiments of a <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> hymn will declare how far their worship was removed from the grossest idolatry.
 Before the end of the sixth century, these images, made without hands, (in <NORP>Greek</NORP> it is a single word, (11)) were propagated in the camps and cities of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire: (12) they were the objects of worship, and the instruments of miracles; and in the hour of danger or tumult, their venerable presence could revive the hope, rekindle the courage, or repress the fury, of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions.
Its copies.
 Of these pictures, the far greater part, the transcripts of a human pencil, could only pretend to a secondary likeness and improper title: but there were some of higher descent, who derived their resemblance from an immediate contact with the original, endowed, for that purpose, with a miraculous and prolific virtue.
 The most ambitious aspired from a filial to a fraternal relation with the image of Edessa; and such is the veronica of Rome, or Spain, or Jerusalem, which <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> in his agony and bloody sweat applied to his face, and delivered to a holy matron.
 The fruitful precedent was speedily transferred to the <PERSON>Virgin</PERSON> Mary, and the saints and martyrs.
 In the church of Diospolis, in Palestine, the features of the Mother of God (13) were deeply inscribed in a marble column; the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> have been decorated by the pencil of St.
 Luke; and the Evangelist, who was perhaps a physician, has been forced to exercise the occupation of a painter, so profane and odious in the eyes of the primitive Christians.
 The Olympian Jove, created by the muse of <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> and the chisel of Phidias, might inspire a philosophic mind with momentary devotion; but these <NORP>Catholic</NORP> images were faintly and flatly delineated by monkish artists in the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> degeneracy of taste and genius.
 (14) Opposition to image-worship.
 The worship of images had stolen into the church by insensible degrees, and each petty step was pleasing to the superstitious mind, as productive of comfort, and innocent of sin.
 But in the beginning of the eighth century, in the full magnitude of the abuse, the more timorous <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were awakened by an apprehension, that under the mask of Christianity, they had restored the religion of their fathers: they heard, with grief and impatience, the name of idolaters; the incessant charge of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and Mahometans, (15) who derived from the <PERSON>Law</PERSON> and the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> an immortal hatred to graven images and all relative worship.
 The servitude of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> might curb their zeal, and depreciate their authority; but the triumphant Mussulmans, who reigned at Damascus, and threatened Constantinople, cast into the scale of reproach the accumulated weight of truth and victory.
 The cities of Syria, Palestine, and <GPE>Egypt</GPE> had been fortified with the images of Christ, his mother, and his saints; and each city presumed on the hope or promise of miraculous defence.
 In a rapid conquest of ten years, the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> subdued those cities and these images; and, in their opinion, the Lord of Hosts pronounced a decisive judgment between the adoration and contempt of these mute and inanimate idols.
 For a while <GPE>Edessa</GPE> had braved the <NORP>Persian</NORP> assaults; but the chosen city, the spouse of Christ, was involved in the common ruin; and his divine resemblance became the slave and trophy of the infidels.
 After a servitude of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, the <FAC>Palladium</FAC> was yielded to the devotion of Constantinople, for a ransom of twelve thousand pounds of silver, the redemption of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Mussulmans, and a perpetual truce for the territory of Edessa.
 (16) In this season of distress and dismay, the eloquence of the monks was exercised in the defence of images; and they attempted to prove, that the sin and schism of the greatest part of the <NORP>Orientals</NORP> had forfeited the favour, and annihilated the virtue, of these precious symbols.
 But they were now opposed by the murmurs of many simple or rational Christians, who appealed to the evidence of texts, of facts, and of the primitive times, and secretly desired the reformation of the church.
 As the worship of images had never been established by any general or positive law, its progress in the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire had been retarded, or accelerated, by the differences of men and manners, the local degrees of refinement, and the personal characters of the bishops.
 The splendid devotion was fondly cherished by the levity of the capital, and the inventive genius of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> clergy; while the rude and remote districts of <LOC>Asia</LOC> were strangers to this innovation of sacred luxury.
 Many large congregations of <NORP>Gnostics</NORP> and <NORP>Arians</NORP> maintained, after their conversion, the simple worship which had preceded their separation; and the Armenians, the most warlike subjects of Rome, were not reconciled, in the twelfth century, to the sight of images.
 (17) These various denominations of men afforded a fund of prejudice and aversion, of small account in the villages of <LOC>Anatolia</LOC> or Thrace, but which, in the fortune of a soldier, a prelate, or a eunuch, might be often connected with the powers of the church and state.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Iconoclast, and his successors, A.
D.
 726-840.
 Of such adventurers, the most fortunate was the emperor <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Third, (18) who, from the mountains of Isauria, ascended the throne of the East.
 He was ignorant of sacred and profane letters; but his education, his reason, perhaps his intercourse with the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and Arabs, had inspired the martial peasant with a hatred of images; and it was held to be the duty of a prince to impose on his subjects the dictates of his own conscience.
 But in the outset of an unsettled reign, during ten years of toil and danger, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> submitted to the meanness of hypocrisy, bowed before the idols which he despised, and satisfied the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff with the annual professions of his orthodoxy and zeal.
 In the reformation of religion, his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> steps were moderate and cautious: he assembled a great council of senators and bishops, and enacted, with their consent, that all the images should be removed from the sanctuary and altar to a proper height in the churches where they might be visible to the eyes, and inaccessible to the superstition, of the people.
 But it was impossible on either side to check the rapid through adverse impulse of veneration and abhorrence: in their lofty position, the sacred images still edified their votaries, and reproached the tyrant.
 He was himself provoked by resistance and invective; and his own party accused him of an imperfect discharge of his duty, and urged for his imitation the example of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> king, who had broken without scruple the brazen serpent of the temple.
 By a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> edict, he proscribed the existence as well as the use of religious pictures; the churches of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the provinces were cleansed from idolatry; the images of Christ, the Virgin, and the saints, were demolished, or a smooth surface of plaster was spread over the walls of the edifice.
 The sect of the <NORP>Iconoclasts</NORP> was supported by the zeal and despotism of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> emperors, and the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> were involved in a noisy conflict of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and twenty years.
 It was the design of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the <NORP>Isaurian</NORP> to pronounce the condemnation of images as an article of faith, and by the authority of a general council: but the convocation of such an assembly was reserved for his son Constantine; (19) and though it is stigmatized by triumphant bigotry as a meeting of fools and atheists, their own partial and mutilated acts betray many symptoms of reason and piety.
 Their synod of Constantinople, A.
D.
 754.
 The debates and decrees of many provincial synods introduced the summons of the general council which met in the suburbs of Constantinople, and was composed of the respectable number of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and thirty-eight bishops of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Anatolia; for the patriarchs of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> and <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> were the slaves of the caliph, and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff had withdrawn the churches of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <LOC>West</LOC> from the communion of the Greeks.
 This <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> synod assumed the rank and powers of the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> general council; yet even this title was a recognition of the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> preceding assemblies, which had laboriously built the structure of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> faith.
 After a serious deliberation of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months, the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and thirty-eight bishops pronounced and subscribed a unanimous decree, that all visible symbols of Christ, except in the Eucharist, were either blasphemous or heretical; that image-worship was a corruption of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> and a renewal of Paganism; that all such monuments of idolatry should be broken or erased; and that those who should refuse to deliver the objects of their private superstition, were guilty of disobedience to the authority of the church and of the emperor.
 In their loud and loyal acclamations, they celebrated the merits of their temporal redeemer; and to his zeal and justice they intrusted the execution of their spiritual censures.
 At Constantinople, as in the former councils, the will of the prince was the rule of episcopal faith; but on this occasion, I am inclined to suspect that a large majority of the prelates sacrificed their secret conscience to the temptations of hope and fear.
 Their creed.
 In the long night of superstition, the <NORP>Christians</NORP> had wandered far away from the simplicity of the gospel: nor was it easy for them to discern the clue, and tread back the mazes, of the labyrinth.
 The worship of images was inseparably blended, at least to a pious fancy, with the Cross, the Virgin, the Saints and their relics; the holy ground was involved in a cloud of miracles and visions; and the nerves of the mind, curiosity and scepticism, were benumbed by the habits of obedience and belief.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> himself is accused of indulging a royal license to doubt, or deny, or deride the mysteries of the Catholics, (20) but they were deeply inscribed in the public and private creed of his bishops; and the boldest <NORP>Iconoclast</NORP> might assault with a secret horror the monuments of popular devotion, which were consecrated to the honour of his celestial patrons.
 In the reformation of the sixteenth century, freedom and knowledge had expanded all the faculties of man: the thirst of innovation superseded the reverence of antiquity; and the vigour of <LOC>Europe</LOC> could disdain those phantoms which terrified the sickly and servile weakness of the Greeks.
 Their persecution of the images and monks, A.
D.
 726-775.
 The scandal of an abstract heresy can be only proclaimed to the people by the blast of the ecclesiastical trumpet; but the most ignorant can perceive, the most torpid must feel, the profanation and downfall of their visible deities.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> hostilities of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> were directed against a lofty <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> on the vestibule, and above the gate, of the palace.
 A ladder had been planted for the assault, but it was furiously shaken by a crowd of zealots and women: they beheld, with pious transport, the ministers of sacrilege tumbling from on high and dashed against the pavement: and the honours of the ancient martyrs were prostituted to these criminals, who justly suffered for murder and rebellion.
 (21) The execution of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> edicts was resisted by frequent tumults in <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the provinces: the person of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> was endangered, his officers were massacred, and the popular enthusiasm was quelled by the strongest efforts of the civil and military power.
 Of the Archipelago, or Holy Sea, the numerous islands were filled with images and monks: their votaries abjured, without scruple, the enemy of Christ, his mother, and the saints; they armed a fleet of boats and galleys, displayed their consecrated banners, and boldly steered for the harbour of Constantinople, to place on the throne a new favourite of God and the people.
 They depended on the succour of a miracle: but their miracles were inefficient against the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fire; and, after the defeat and conflagration of the fleet, the naked islands were abandoned to the clemency or justice of the conqueror.
 The son of Leo, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> year of his reign, had undertaken an expedition against the Saracens: during his absence, the capital, the palace, and the purple, were occupied by his kinsman Artavasdes, the ambitious champion of the orthodox faith.
 The worship of images was triumphantly restored: the patriarch renounced his dissimulation, or dissembled his sentiments and the righteous claims of the usurper was acknowledged, both in the new, and in ancient, Rome.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> flew for refuge to his paternal mountains; but he descended at the head of the bold and affectionate Isaurians; and his final victory confounded the arms and predictions of the fanatics.
 His long reign was distracted with clamour, sedition, conspiracy, and mutual hatred, and sanguinary revenge; the persecution of images was the motive or pretence, of his adversaries; and, if they missed a temporal diadem, they were rewarded by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> with the crown of martyrdom.
 In every act of open and clandestine treason, the emperor felt the unforgiving enmity of the monks, the faithful slaves of the superstition to which they owed their riches and influence.
 They prayed, they preached, they absolved, they inflamed, they conspired; the solitude of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> poured forth a torrent of invective; and the pen of St.
 John Damascenus, (22) the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fathers, devoted the tyrant's head, both in this world and the next.
 (23) I am not at leisure to examine how far the monks provoked, nor how much they have exaggerated, their real and pretended sufferings, nor how many lost their lives or limbs, their eyes or their beards, by the cruelty of the emperor.
 From the chastisement of individuals, he proceeded to the abolition of the order; and, as it was wealthy and useless, his resentment might be stimulated by avarice, and justified by patriotism.
 The formidable name and mission of the Dragon, (24) his visitor-general, excited the terror and abhorrence of the black nation: the religious communities were dissolved, the buildings were converted into magazines, or bar racks; the lands, movables, and cattle were confiscated; and our modern precedents will support the charge, that much wanton or malicious havoc was exercised against the relics, and even the books of the monasteries.
 With the habit and profession of monks, the public and private worship of images was rigorously proscribed; and it should seem, that a solemn abjuration of idolatry was exacted from the subjects, or at least from the clergy, of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 (25) State of Italy.
 The patient <LOC>East</LOC> abjured, with reluctance, her sacred images; they were fondly cherished, and vigorously defended, by the independent zeal of the Italians.
 In ecclesiastical rank and jurisdiction, the patriarch of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the pope of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were nearly equal.
 But the <NORP>Greek</NORP> prelate was a domestic slave under the eye of his master, at whose nod he alternately passed from the convent to the throne, and from the throne to the convent.
 A distant and dangerous station, amidst the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of the West, excited the spirit and freedom of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> bishops.
 Their popular election endeared them to the Romans: the public and private indigence was relieved by their ample revenue; and the weakness or neglect of the emperors compelled them to consult, both in peace and war, the temporal safety of the city.
 In the school of adversity the priest insensibly imbibed the virtues and the ambition of a prince; the same character was assumed, the same policy was adopted, by the Italian, the Greek, or the Syrian, who ascended the chair of St.
 Peter; and, after the loss of her legions and provinces, the genius and fortune of the popes again restored the supremacy of Rome.
 It is agreed, that in the eighth century, their dominion was founded on rebellion, and that the rebellion was produced, and justified, by the heresy of the Iconoclasts; but the conduct of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> Gregory, in this memorable contest, is variously interpreted by the wishes of their friends and enemies.
 The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> writers unanimously declare, that, after a fruitless admonition, they pronounced the separation of the <LOC>East</LOC> and West, and deprived the sacrilegious tyrant of the revenue and sovereignty of Italy.
 Their excommunication is still more clearly expressed by the Greeks, who beheld the accomplishment of the papal triumphs; and as they are more strongly attached to their religion than to their country, they praise, instead of blaming, the zeal and orthodoxy of these apostolical men.
 (26) The modern champions of <GPE>Rome</GPE> are eager to accept the praise and the precedent: this great and glorious example of the deposition of royal heretics is celebrated by the cardinals <PERSON>Baronius</PERSON> and Bellarmine; (27) and if they are asked, why the same thunders were not hurled against the <PERSON>Neros</PERSON> and <NORP>Julians</NORP> of antiquity, they reply, that the weakness of the primitive church was the sole cause of her patient loyalty.
 (28) On this occasion the effects of love and hatred are the same; and the zealous Protestants, who seek to kindle the indignation, and to alarm the fears, of princes and magistrates, expatiate on the insolence and treason of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Gregories</NORP> against their lawful sovereign.
 (29) They are defended only by the moderate Catholics, for the most part, of the <NORP>Gallican</NORP> church, (30) who respect the saint, without approving the sin.
 These common advocates of the crown and the mitre circumscribe the truth of facts by the rule of equity, Scripture, and tradition, and appeal to the evidence of the Latins, (31) and the lives (32) and epistles of the popes themselves.
 Epistles of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> II.
 To the emperor, A.
D.
 727.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> original epistles, from <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> to the emperor Leo, are still extant; (33) and if they cannot be praised as the most perfect models of eloquence and logic, they exhibit the portrait, or at least the mask, of the founder of the papal monarchy.
 After this decent salutation, the pope attempts the usual distinction between the idols of antiquity and the <NORP>Christian</NORP> images.
 The former were the fanciful representations of phantoms or daemons, at a time when the true God had not manifested his person in any visible likeness.
 The latter are the genuine forms of Christ, his mother, and his saints, who had approved, by a crowd of miracles, the innocence and merit of this relative worship.
 He must indeed have trusted to the ignorance of Leo, since he could assert the perpetual use of images, from the apostolic age, and their venerable presence in the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> synods of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 A more specious argument is drawn from present possession and recent practice the harmony of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world supersedes the demand of a general council; and <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> frankly confesses, than such assemblies can only be useful under the reign of an orthodox prince.
 To the impudent and inhuman Leo, more guilty than a heretic, he recommends peace, silence, and implicit obedience to his spiritual guides of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Rome.
 The limits of civil and ecclesiastical powers are defined by the pontiff.
 To the former he appropriates the body; to the latter, the soul: the sword of justice is in the hands of the magistrate: the more formidable weapon of excommunication is intrusted to the clergy; and in the exercise of their divine commission a zealous son will not spare his offending father: the successor of St.
 Peter may lawfully chastise the kings of the earth.
 "You assault us, O tyrant! with a carnal and military hand: unarmed and naked we can only implore the Christ, the prince of the heavenly host, that he will send unto you a devil, for the destruction of your body and the salvation of your soul.
 You declare, with foolish arrogance, I will despatch my orders to Rome: I will break in pieces the image of St.
 Peter; and Gregory, like his predecessor Martin, shall be transported in chains, and in exile, to the foot of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> throne.
 Would to God that I might be permitted to tread in the footsteps of the holy Martin! but may the fate of <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> serve as a warning to the persecutors of the church! After his just condemnation by the bishops of Sicily, the tyrant was cut off, in the fullness of his sins, by a domestic servant: the saint is still adored by the nations of Scythia, among whom he ended his banishment and his life.
 But it is our duty to live for the edification and support of the faithful people; nor are we reduced to risk our safety on the event of a combat.
 Incapable as you are of defending your <NORP>Roman</NORP> subjects, the maritime situation of the city may perhaps expose it to your depredation but we can remove to the distance of <CARDINAL>four-and-twenty</CARDINAL> stadia, (34) to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> fortress of the Lombards, and then - you may pursue the winds.
 Are you ignorant that the popes are the bond of union, the mediators of peace, between the <LOC>East</LOC> and West? The eyes of the nations are fixed on our humility; and they revere, as a God upon earth, the apostle St.
 Peter, whose image you threaten to destroy.
 (35) The remote and interior kingdoms of the <LOC>West</LOC> present their homage to <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and his vicegerent; and we now prepare to visit <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their most powerful monarchs, who desires to receive from our hands the sacrament of baptism.
 (36) The <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> have submitted to the yoke of the gospel, while you alone are deaf to the voice of the shepherd.
 These pious <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> are kindled into rage: they thirst to avenge the persecution of the East.
 Abandon your rash and fatal enterprise; reflect, tremble, and repent.
 If you persist, we are innocent of the blood that will be spilt in the contest; may it fall on your own head!" Revolt of Italy, A.
D.
 728, etc.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assault of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> against the images of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had been witnessed by a crowd of strangers from <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the West, who related with grief and indignation the sacrilege of the emperor.
 But on the reception of his proscriptive edict, they trembled for their domestic deities: the images of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and the Virgin, of the angels, martyrs, and saints, were abolished in all the churches of Italy; and a strong alternative was proposed to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, the royal favour as the price of his compliance, degradation and exile as the penalty of his disobedience.
 Neither zeal nor policy allowed him to hesitate; and the haughty strain in which <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> addressed the emperor displays his confidence in the truth of his doctrine or the powers of resistance.
 Without depending on prayers or miracles, he boldly armed against the public enemy, and his pastoral letters admonished the <NORP>Italians</NORP> of their danger and their duty.
 (37) At this signal, Ravenna, Venice, and the cities of the <WORK_OF_ART>Exarchate</WORK_OF_ART> and Pentapolis, adhered to the cause of religion; their military force by sea and land consisted, for the most part, of the natives; and the spirit of patriotism and zeal was transfused into the mercenary strangers.
 The <NORP>Italians</NORP> swore to live and die in the defence of the pope and the holy images; the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was devoted to their father, and even the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> were ambitious to share the merit and advantage of this holy war.
 The most treasonable act, but the most obvious revenge, was the destruction of the statues of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> himself: the most effectual and pleasing measure of rebellion, was the withholding the tribute of Italy, and depriving him of a power which he had recently abused by the imposition of a new capitation.
 (38) A form of administration was preserved by the election of magistrates and governors; and so high was the public indignation, that the <NORP>Italians</NORP> were prepared to create an orthodox emperor, and to conduct him with a fleet and army to the palace of Constantinople.
 In that palace, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> bishops, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> Gregory, were condemned as the authors of the revolt, and every attempt was made, either by fraud or force, to seize their persons, and to strike at their lives.
 The city was repeatedly visited or assaulted by captains of the guards, and dukes and exarchs of high dignity or secret trust; they landed with foreign troops, they obtained some domestic aid, and the superstition of <GPE>Naples</GPE> may blush that her fathers were attached to the cause of heresy.
 But these clandestine or open attacks were repelled by the courage and vigilance of the Romans; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were overthrown and massacred, their leaders suffered an ignominious death, and the popes, however inclined to mercy, refused to intercede for these guilty victims.
 At Ravenna, (39) the several quarters of the city had long exercised a bloody and hereditary feud; in religious controversy they found a new aliment of faction: but the votaries of images were superior in numbers or spirit, and the exarch, who attempted to stem the torrent, lost his life in a popular sedition.
 To punish this flagitious deed, and restore his dominion in Italy, the emperor sent a fleet and army into the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf.
 After suffering from the winds and waves much loss and delay, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> made their descent in the neighbourhood of Ravenna: they threatened to depopulate the guilty capital, and to imitate, perhaps to surpass, the example of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> the Second, who had chastised a former rebellion by the choice and execution of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> of the principal inhabitants.
 The women and clergy, in sackcloth and ashes, lay prostrate in prayer: the men were in arms for the defence of their country; the common danger had united the factions, and the event of a battle was preferred to the slow miseries of a siege.
 In a hard-fought day, as the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies alternately yielded and advanced, a phantom was seen, a voice was heard, and <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was victorious by the assurance of victory.
 The strangers retreated to their ships, but the populous sea-coast poured forth a multitude of boats; the waters of the <LOC>Po</LOC> were so deeply infected with blood, that during <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years the public prejudice abstained from the fish of the river; and the institution of an annual feast perpetuated the worship of images, and the abhorrence of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant.
 Amidst the triumph of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> arms, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff convened a synod of <CARDINAL>ninety-three</CARDINAL> bishops against the heresy of the Iconoclasts.
 With their consent, he pronounced a general excommunication against all who by word or deed should attack the tradition of the fathers and the images of the saints: in this sentence the emperor was tacitly involved, (40) but the vote of a <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> and hopeless remonstrance may seem to imply that the anathema was yet suspended over his guilty head.
 No sooner had they confirmed their own safety, the worship of images, and the freedom of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, than the popes appear to have relaxed of their severity, and to have spared the relics of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> dominion.
 Their moderate councils delayed and prevented the election of a new emperor, and they exhorted the <NORP>Italians</NORP> not to separate from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarchy.
 The exarch was permitted to reside within the walls of Ravenna, a captive rather than a master; and till the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> coronation of Charlemagne, the government of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> was exercised in the name of the successors of Constantine.
 (41) Republic of Rome.
 The liberty of Rome, which had been oppressed by the arms and arts of Augustus, was rescued, after <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years of servitude, from the persecution of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Isaurian.
 By the Caesars, the triumphs of the consuls had been annihilated: in the decline and fall of the empire, the god Terminus, the sacred boundary, had insensibly receded from the ocean, the Rhine, the Danube, and the Euphrates; and <GPE>Rome</GPE> was reduced to her ancient territory from <GPE>Viterbo</GPE> to Terracina, and from <GPE>Narni</GPE> to the mouth of the Tyber.
 (42) When the kings were banished, the republic reposed on the firm basis which had been founded by their wisdom and virtue.
 Their perpetual jurisdiction was divided between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> annual magistrates: the senate continued to exercise the powers of administration and counsel; and the legislative authority was distributed in the assemblies of the people, by a well-proportioned scale of property and service.
 Ignorant of the arts of luxury, the primitive <NORP>Romans</NORP> had improved the science of government and war: the will of the community was absolute: the rights of individuals were sacred: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and thirty thousand citizens were armed for defence or conquest; and a band of robbers and outlaws was moulded into a nation deserving of freedom and ambitious of glory.
 (43) When the sovereignty of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors was extinguished, the ruins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> presented the sad image of depopulation and decay: her slavery was a habit, her liberty an accident; the effect of superstition, and the object of her own amazement and terror.
 The <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> vestige of the substance, or even the forms, of the constitution, was obliterated from the practice and memory of the Romans; and they were devoid of knowledge, or virtue, again to build the fabric of a commonwealth.
 Their scanty remnant, the offspring of slaves and strangers, was despicable in the eyes of the victorious Barbarians.
 As often as the <NORP>Franks</NORP> or <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> expressed their most bitter contempt of a foe, they called him a Roman; "and in this name," says the bishop Liutprand, "we include whatever is base, whatever is cowardly, whatever is perfidious, the extremes of avarice and luxury, and every vice that can prostitute the dignity of human nature.
" (44) By the necessity of their situation, the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were cast into the rough model of a <NORP>republican</NORP> government: they were compelled to elect some judges in peace, and some leaders in war: the nobles assembled to deliberate, and their resolves could not be executed without the union and consent of the multitude.
 The style of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate and people was revived, (45) but the spirit was fled; and their new independence was disgraced by the tumultuous conflict of licentiousness and oppression.
 The want of laws could only be supplied by the influence of religion, and their foreign and domestic counsels were moderated by the authority of the bishop.
 His alms, his sermons, his correspondence with the kings and prelates of the West, his recent services, their gratitude, and oath, accustomed the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to consider him as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate or prince of the city.
 The <NORP>Christian</NORP> humility of the popes was not offended by the name of Dominus, or Lord; and their face and inscription are still apparent on the most ancient coins.
 (46) Their temporal dominion is now confirmed by the reverence of a thousand years; and their noblest title is the free choice of a people, whom they had redeemed from slavery.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> attacked by the Lombards, A.
D.
 730-752 .
 In the quarrels of ancient Greece, the holy people of <GPE>Elis</GPE> enjoyed a perpetual peace, under the protection of Jupiter, and in the exercise of the <EVENT>Olympic</EVENT> games.
 (47) Happy would it have been for the Romans, if a similar privilege had guarded the patrimony of St.
 Peter from the calamities of war; if the Christians, who visited the holy threshold, would have sheathed their swords in the presence of the apostle and his successor.
 But this mystic circle could have been traced only by the wand of a legislator and a sage: this pacific system was incompatible with the zeal and ambition of the popes the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were not addicted, like the inhabitants of Elis, to the innocent and placid labours of agriculture; and the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of Italy, though softened by the climate, were far below the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> states in the institutions of public and private life.
 A memorable example of repentance and piety was exhibited by Liutprand, king of the Lombards.
 In arms, at the gate of the Vatican, the conqueror listened to the voice of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Second, (48) withdrew his troops, resigned his conquests, respectfully visited the church of St.
 Peter, and after performing his devotions, offered his sword and dagger, his cuirass and mantle, his silver cross, and his crown of gold, on the tomb of the apostle.
 But this religious fervour was the illusion, perhaps the artifice, of the moment; the sense of interest is strong and lasting; the love of arms and rapine was congenial to the Lombards; and both the prince and people were irresistibly tempted by the disorders of Italy, the nakedness of Rome, and the unwarlike profession of her new chief.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> edicts of the emperor, they declared themselves the champions of the holy images: <GPE>Liutprand</GPE> invaded the province of Romagna, which had already assumed that distinctive appellation; the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> of the <WORK_OF_ART>Exarchate</WORK_OF_ART> yielded without reluctance to his civil and military power; and a foreign enemy was introduced for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time into the impregnable fortress of Ravenna.
 That city and fortress were speedily recovered by the active diligence and maritime forces of the Venetians; and those faithful subjects obeyed the exhortation of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> himself, in separating the personal guilt of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> from the general cause of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (49) The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were less mindful of the service, than the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> of the injury: the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, hostile in their faith, were reconciled in a dangerous and unnatural alliance: the king and the exarch marched to the conquest of <GPE>Spoleto</GPE> and Rome: the storm evaporated without effect, but the policy of <GPE>Liutprand</GPE> alarmed <GPE>Italy</GPE> with a vexatious alternative of hostility and truce.
 His successor <PERSON>Astolphus</PERSON> declared himself the equal enemy of the emperor and the pope: <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was subdued by force or treachery, (50) and this final conquest extinguished the series of the exarchs, who had reigned with a subordinate power since the time of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and the ruin of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kingdom.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was summoned to acknowledge the victorious <PERSON>Lombard</PERSON> as her lawful sovereign; the annual tribute of a piece of gold was fixed as the ransom of each citizen, and the sword of destruction was unsheathed to exact the penalty of her disobedience.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> hesitated; they entreated; they complained; and the threatening <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were checked by arms and negotiations, till the popes had engaged the friendship of an ally and avenger beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (51) Her deliverance by Pepin, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>754</CARDINAL> .
 In his distress, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had implored the aid of the hero of the age, of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> Martel, who governed the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy with the humble title of mayor or duke; and who, by his signal victory over the Saracens, had saved his country, and perhaps Europe, from the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> yoke.
 The ambassadors of the pope were received by <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> with decent reverence; but the greatness of his occupations, and the shortness of his life, prevented his interference in the affairs of Italy, except by a friendly and ineffectual mediation.
 His son Pepin, the heir of his power and virtues, assumed the office of champion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church; and the zeal of the <NORP>French</NORP> prince appears to have been prompted by the love of glory and religion.
 But the danger was on the banks of the Tyber, the succour on those of the Seine, and our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant misery.
 Amidst the tears of the city, <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> embraced the generous resolution of visiting in person the courts of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> and France, to deprecate the injustice of his enemy, or to excite the pity and indignation of his friend.
 After soothing the public despair by litanies and orations, he undertook this laborious journey with the ambassadors of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 The king of the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> was inexorable; but his threats could not silence the complaints, nor retard the speed of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, who traversed the Pennine Alps, reposed in the abbey of St.
 Maurice, and hastened to grasp the right hand of his protector; a hand which was never lifted in vain, either in war or friendship.
 <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> was entertained as the visible successor of the apostle; at the next assembly, the field of March or of May, his injuries were exposed to a devout and warlike nation, and he repassed the Alps, not as a suppliant, but as a conqueror, at the head of a <NORP>French</NORP> army, which was led by the king in person.
 The Lombards, after a weak resistance, obtained an ignominious peace, and swore to restore the possessions, and to respect the sanctity, of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church.
 But no sooner was <PERSON>Astolphus</PERSON> delivered from the presence of the <NORP>French</NORP> arms, than he forgot his promise and resented his disgrace.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was again encompassed by his arms; and Stephen, apprehensive of fatiguing the zeal of his <NORP>Transalpine</NORP> allies enforced his complaint and request by an eloquent letter in the name and person of St.
 Peter himself.
 (52) The apostle assures his adopted sons, the king, the clergy, and the nobles of France, that, dead in the flesh, he is still alive in the spirit; that they now hear, and must obey, the voice of the founder and guardian of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church; that the Virgin, the angels, the saints, and the martyrs, and all the host of heaven, unanimously urge the request, and will confess the obligation; that riches, victory, and paradise, will crown their pious enterprise, and that eternal damnation will be the penalty of their neglect, if they suffer his tomb, his temple, and his people, to fall into the hands of the perfidious Lombards.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> was not less rapid and fortunate than the first: St.
 Peter was satisfied, <GPE>Rome</GPE> was again saved, and <PERSON>Astolphus</PERSON> was taught the lessons of justice and sincerity by the scourge of a foreign master.
 After this double chastisement, the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> languished about twenty years in a state of languor and decay.
 But their minds were not yet humbled to their condition; and instead of affecting the pacific virtues of the feeble, they peevishly harassed the <NORP>Romans</NORP> with a repetition of claims, evasions, and inroads, which they undertook without reflection, and terminated without glory.
 On either side, their expiring monarchy was pressed by the zeal and prudence of <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> the First, the genius, the fortune, and greatness of Charlemagne, the son of Pepin; these heroes of the church and state were united in public and domestic friendship, and while they trampled on the prostrate, they varnished their proceedings with the fairest colours of equity and moderation.
 (53) The passes of the Alps, and the walls of Pavia, were the only defence of the Lombards; Conquest of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> by Charlemagne, A.

the former were surprised, the latter were invested, by the son of Pepin; and after a blockade of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years, Desiderius, the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> of their native princes, surrendered his sceptre and his capital.
 Under the dominion of a foreign king, but in the possession of their national laws, the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> became the brethren, rather than the subjects, of the Franks; who derived their blood, and manners, and language, from the same <NORP>Germanic</NORP> origin.

D.
 751.
 753.
 768.
 The mutual obligations of the popes and the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> family form the important link of ancient and modern, of civil and ecclesiastical, history.
 In the conquest of Italy, the champions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church obtained a favourable occasion, a specious title, the wishes of the people, the prayers and intrigues of the clergy.
 But the most essential gifts of the popes to the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> race were the dignities of king of France, (55) and of patrician of Rome.
 I.
 Under the sacerdotal monarchy of St.
 Peter, the nations began to resume the practice of seeking, on the banks of the Tyber, their kings, their laws, and the oracles of their fate.
 The <NORP>Franks</NORP> were perplexed between the name and substance of their government.
 All the powers of royalty were exercised by Pepin, mayor of the palace; and nothing, except the regal title, was wanting to his ambition.
 His enemies were crushed by his valour; his friends were multiplied by his liberality; his father had been the saviour of Christendom; and the claims of personal merit were repeated and ennobled in a descent of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> generations.
 The name and image of royalty was still preserved in the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> descendant of Clovis, the feeble Childeric; but his obsolete right could only be used as an instrument of sedition: the nation was desirous of restoring the simplicity of the constitution; and Pepin, a subject and a prince, was ambitious to ascertain his own rank and the fortune of his family.
 The mayor and the nobles were bound, by an oath of fidelity, to the royal phantom: the blood of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> was pure and sacred in their eyes; and their common ambassadors addressed the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, to dispel their scruples, or to absolve their promise.
 The interest of <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> Zachary, the successor of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Gregories, prompted him to decide, and to decide in their favour: he pronounced that the nation might lawfully unite in the same person the title and authority of king; and that the unfortunate Childeric, a victim of the public safety, should be degraded, shaved, and confined in a monastery for the remainder of his days.
 An answer so agreeable to their wishes was accepted by the <NORP>Franks</NORP> as the opinion of a casuist, the sentence of a judge, or the oracle of a prophet: the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> race disappeared from the earth; and <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> was exalted on a buckler by the suffrage of a free people, accustomed to obey his laws and to march under his standard.
 His coronation was twice performed, with the sanction of the popes, by their most faithful servant St.
 Boniface, the apostle of Germany, and by the grateful hands of <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> the Third, who, in the monastery of St.
 Denys placed the diadem on the head of his benefactor.
 The royal unction of the kings of <GPE>Israel</GPE> was dexterously applied: (56) the successor of St.
 Peter assumed the character of a divine ambassador: a <NORP>German</NORP> chieftain was transformed into the Lord's anointed; and this <NORP>Jewish</NORP> rite has been diffused and maintained by the superstition and vanity of modern Europe.
 The <NORP>Franks</NORP> were absolved from their ancient oath; but a dire anathema was thundered against them and their posterity, if they should dare to renew the same freedom of choice, or to elect a king, except in the holy and meritorious race of the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> princes.
 Without apprehending the future danger, these princes gloried in their present security: the secretary of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> affirms, that the <NORP>French</NORP> sceptre was transferred by the authority of the popes; (57) and in their boldest enterprises, they insist, with confidence, on this signal and successful act of temporal jurisdiction.
 Patricians of Rome.
 II.
 In the change of manners and language the patricians of <GPE>Rome</GPE> (58) were far removed from the senate of Romulus, on the palace of Constantine, from the free nobles of the republic, or the fictitious parents of the emperor.
 After the recovery of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> by the arms of Justinian, the importance and danger of those remote provinces required the presence of a supreme magistrate; he was indifferently styled the exarch or the patrician; and these governors of Ravenna, who fill their place in the chronology of princes, extended their jurisdiction over the <NORP>Roman</NORP> city.
 Since the revolt of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the loss of the Exarchate, the distress of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had exacted some sacrifice of their independence.
 Yet, even in this act, they exercised the right of disposing of themselves; and the decrees of the senate and people successively invested <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> Martel and his posterity with the honours of patrician of Rome.
 The leaders of a powerful nation would have disdained a servile title and subordinate office; but the reign of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors was suspended; and, in the vacancy of the empire, they derived a more glorious commission from the pope and the republic.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassadors presented these patricians with the keys of the shrine of St.
 Peter, as a pledge and symbol of sovereignty; with a holy banner which it was their right and duty to unfurl in the defence of the church and city.
 (59) In the time of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> Martel and of Pepin, the interposition of the <PERSON>Lombard</PERSON> kingdom covered the freedom, while it threatened the safety, of Rome; and the patriciate represented only the title, the service, the alliance, of these distant protectors.
 The power and policy of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> annihilated an enemy, and imposed a master.
 In his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> visit to the capital, he was received with all the honours which had formerly been paid to the exarch, the representative of the emperor; and these honours obtained some new decorations from the joy and gratitude of <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> the First.
 (60) No sooner was he informed of the sudden approach of the monarch, than he despatched the magistrates and nobles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to meet him, with the banner, about thirty miles from the city.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile, the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way was lined with the schools, or national communities, of Greeks, Lombards, Saxons, etc.
: the <NORP>Roman</NORP> youth were under arms; and the children of a more tender age, with palms and olive branches in their hands, chanted the praises of their great deliverer.
 At the aspect of the holy crosses, and ensigns of the saints, he dismounted from his horse, led the procession of his nobles to the Vatican, and, as he ascended the stairs, devoutly kissed each step of the threshold of the apostles.
 In the portico, <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> expected him at the head of his clergy: they embraced, as friends and equals; but in their march to the altar, the king or patrician assumed the right hand of the pope.
 Nor was the <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> content with these vain and empty demonstrations of respect.
 In the twenty-six years that elapsed between the conquest of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> and his <NORP>Imperial</NORP> coronation, Rome, which had been delivered by the sword, was subject, as his own, to the sceptre of Charlemagne.
 The people swore allegiance to his person and family: in his name money was coined, and justice was administered; and the election of the popes was examined and confirmed by his authority.
 Except an original and self-inherent claim of sovereignty, there was not any prerogative remaining, which the title of emperor could add to the patrician of Rome.
 (61) Donations of <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> to the popes .
 The gratitude of the <NORP>Carlovingians</NORP> was adequate to these obligations, and their names are consecrated, as the saviours and benefactors of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church.
 Her ancient patrimony of farms and houses was transformed by their bounty into the temporal dominion of cities and provinces; and the donation of the <WORK_OF_ART>Exarchate</WORK_OF_ART> was the first-fruits of the conquests of Pepin.
 (62) <PERSON>Astolphus</PERSON> with a sigh relinquished his prey; the keys and the hostages of the principal cities were delivered to the <NORP>French</NORP> ambassador; and, in his master's name, he presented them before the tomb of St.
 Peter.
 The ample measure of the <WORK_OF_ART>Exarchate</WORK_OF_ART> (63) might comprise all the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> which had obeyed the emperor and his vicegerent; but its strict and proper limits were included in the territories of Ravenna, Bologna, and Ferrara: its inseparable dependency was the Pentapolis, which stretched along the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> from <GPE>Rimini</GPE> to Ancona, and advanced into the midland- country as far as the ridges of the Apennine.
 In this transaction, the ambition and avarice of the popes have been severely condemned.
 Perhaps the humility of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> priest should have rejected an earthly kingdom, which it was not easy for him to govern without renouncing the virtues of his profession.
 Perhaps a faithful subject, or even a generous enemy, would have been less impatient to divide the spoils of the Barbarian; and if the emperor had intrusted <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> to solicit in his name the restitution of the Exarchate, I will not absolve the pope from the reproach of treachery and falsehood.
 But in the rigid interpretation of the laws, every <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> may accept, without injury, whatever his benefactor can bestow without injustice.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor had abdicated, or forfeited, his right to the Exarchate; and the sword of <PERSON>Astolphus</PERSON> was broken by the stronger sword of the Carlovingian.
 It was not in the cause of the <NORP>Iconoclast</NORP> that <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> has exposed his person and army in a double expedition beyond the Alps: he possessed, and might lawfully alienate, his conquests: and to the importunities of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> he piously replied that no human consideration should tempt him to resume the gift which he had conferred on the <NORP>Roman</NORP> Pontiff for the remission of his sins, and the salvation of his soul.
 The splendid donation was granted in supreme and absolute dominion, and the world beheld for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time a <NORP>Christian</NORP> bishop invested with the prerogatives of a temporal prince; the choice of magistrates, the exercise of justice, the imposition of taxes, and the wealth of the palace of Ravenna.
 In the dissolution of the <PERSON>Lombard</PERSON> kingdom, the inhabitants of the duchy of <GPE>Spoleto</GPE> (64) sought a refuge from the storm, shaved their heads after the <NORP>Roman</NORP> fashion, declared themselves the servants and subjects of St.
 Peter, and completed, by this voluntary surrender, the present circle of the ecclesiastical state.
 That mysterious circle was enlarged to an indefinite extent, by the verbal or written donation of Charlemagne, (65) who, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> transports of his victory, despoiled himself and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor of the cities and islands which had formerly been annexed to the Exarchate.
 But, in the cooler moments of absence and reflection, he viewed, with an eye of jealousy and envy, the recent greatness of his ecclesiastical ally.
 The execution of his own and his father's promises was respectfully eluded: the king of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> asserted the inalienable rights of the empire; and, in his life and death, Ravenna, (66) as well as Rome, was numbered in the list of his metropolitan cities.
 The sovereignty of the <WORK_OF_ART>Exarchate</WORK_OF_ART> melted away in the hands of the popes; they found in the archbishops of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> a dangerous and domestic rival: (67) the nobles and people disdained the yoke of a priest; and in the disorders of the times, they could only retain the memory of an ancient claim, which, in a more prosperous age, they have revived and realized.
 Forgery of the donation of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> .
 Fraud is the resource of weakness and cunning; and the strong, though ignorant, <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> was often entangled in the net of sacerdotal policy.
 The <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and <NORP>Lateran</NORP> were an arsenal and manufacture, which, according to the occasion, have produced or concealed a various collection of false or genuine, of corrupt or suspicious, acts, as they tended to promote the interest of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church.
 Before the end of the eighth century, some apostolic scribe, perhaps the notorious Isidore, composed the decretals, and the donation of Constantine, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> magic pillars of the spiritual and temporal monarchy of the popes.
 This memorable donation was introduced to the world by an epistle of <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> the First, who exhorts <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> to imitate the liberality, and revive the name, of the great Constantine.
 (68) According to the legend, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperors was healed of the leprosy, and purified in the waters of baptism, by St.
 Silvester, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> bishop; and never was physician more gloriously recompensed.
 His royal proselyte withdrew from the seat and patrimony of St.
 Peter; declared his resolution of founding a new capital in the East; and resigned to the popes the free and perpetual sovereignty of Rome, Italy, and the provinces of the West.
 (69) This fiction was productive of the most beneficial effects.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes were convicted of the guilt of usurpation; and the revolt of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> was the claim of his lawful inheritance.
 The popes were delivered from their debt of gratitude; and the nominal gifts of the <NORP>Carlovingians</NORP> were no more than the just and irrevocable restitution of a scanty portion of the ecclesiastical state.
 The sovereignty of <GPE>Rome</GPE> no longer depended on the choice of a fickle people; and the successors of St.
 Peter and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were invested with the purple and prerogatives of the Caesars.
 So deep was the ignorance and credulity of the times, that the most absurd of fables was received, with equal reverence, in <GPE>Greece</GPE> and in France, and is still enrolled among the decrees of the canon law.
 (70) The emperors, and the Romans, were incapable of discerning a forgery, that subverted their rights and freedom; and the only opposition proceeded from a <NORP>Sabine</NORP> monastery, which, in the beginning of the twelfth century, disputed the truth and validity of the donation of Constantine.
 (71) In the revival of letters and liberty, this fictitious deed was transpierced by the pen of Laurentius Valla, the pen of an eloquent critic and a <NORP>Roman</NORP> patriot.
 (72) His contemporaries of the fifteenth century were astonished at his sacrilegious boldness; yet such is the silent and irresistible progress of reason, that, before the end of the next age, the fable was rejected by the contempt of historians (73) and poets, (74) and the tacit or modest censure of the advocates of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church.
 (75) The popes themselves have indulged a smile at the credulity of the vulgar; (76) but a false and obsolete title still sanctifies their reign; and, by the same fortune which has attended the decretals and the <NORP>Sibylline</NORP> oracles, the edifice has subsisted after the foundations have been undermined.
 Restoration of images in the <LOC>East</LOC> by the empress Irene, A.
D.
 780, etc .
 While the popes established in <GPE>Italy</GPE> their freedom and dominion, the images, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> cause of their revolt, were restored in the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 (77) Under the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the Fifth, the union of civil and ecclesiastical power had overthrown the tree, without extirpating the root, of superstition.
 The idols (for such they were now held) were secretly cherished by the order and the sex most prone to devotion; and the fond alliance of the monks and females obtained a final victory over the reason and authority of man.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fourth</ORDINAL> maintained with less rigour the religion of his father and grandfather; but his wife, the fair and ambitious Irene, had imbibed the zeal of the Athenians, the heirs of the Idolatry, rather than the philosophy, of their ancestors.
 During the life of her husband, these sentiments were inflamed by danger and dissimulation, and she could only labor to protect and promote some favourite monks whom she drew from their caverns, and seated on the metropolitan thrones of the East.
 But as soon as she reigned in her own name and that of her son, <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> more seriously undertook the ruin of the Iconoclasts; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> step of her future persecution was a general edict for liberty of conscience.
 In the restoration of the monks, a thousand images were exposed to the public veneration; a thousand legends were inverted of their sufferings and miracles.
 By the opportunities of death or removal, the episcopal seats were judiciously filled the most eager competitors for earthly or celestial favour anticipated and flattered the judgment of their sovereign; and the promotion of her secretary <PERSON>Tarasius</PERSON> gave <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> the patriarch of Constantinople, and the command of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> church.
 But the decrees of a general council could only be repealed by a similar assembly: (78) the <NORP>Iconoclasts</NORP> whom she convened were bold in possession, and averse to debate; and the feeble voice of the bishops was reechoed by the more formidable clamour of the soldiers and people of Constantinople.
 VIIth general council, <ORG>IInd</ORG> of Nice, A.
D.
 787, Sept.
 24-Oct.
 <CARDINAL>23</CARDINAL> .
The delay and intrigues of a year, the separation of the disaffected troops, and the choice of <GPE>Nice</GPE> for a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> orthodox synod, removed these obstacles; and the episcopal conscience was again, after the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fashion, in the hands of the prince.
 No more than eighteen days were allowed for the consummation of this important work: the <NORP>Iconoclasts</NORP> appeared, not as judges, but as criminals or penitents: the scene was decorated by the legates of <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> and the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> patriarchs, (79) the decrees were framed by the president Taracius, and ratified by the acclamations and subscriptions of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> bishops.
 They unanimously pronounced, that the worship of images is agreeable to <WORK_OF_ART>Scripture</WORK_OF_ART> and reason, to the fathers and councils of the church: but they hesitate whether that worship be relative or direct; whether the Godhead, and the figure of Christ, be entitled to the same mode of adoration.
 Of this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Nicene</PERSON> council the acts are still extant; a curious monument of superstition and ignorance, of falsehood and folly.
 I shall only notice the judgment of the bishops on the comparative merit of image-worship and morality.
 A monk had concluded a truce with the daemon of fornication, on condition of interrupting his <DATE>daily</DATE> prayers to a picture that hung in his cell.
 His scruples prompted him to consult the abbot.
 "Rather than abstain from adoring <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and his Mother in their holy images, it would be better for you," replied the casuist, "to enter every brothel, and visit every prostitute, in the city.
" (80) Final establishment of images by the empress Theodora, A.
D.
 842 For the honour of orthodoxy, at least the orthodoxy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, it is somewhat unfortunate, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes who convened the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> councils of <GPE>Nice</GPE> are both stained with the blood of their sons.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> of these assemblies was approved and rigorously executed by the despotism of Irene, and she refused her adversaries the toleration which at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> she had granted to her friends.
 During the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> succeeding reigns, a period of thirty-eight years, the contest was maintained, with unabated rage and various success, between the worshippers and the breakers of the images; but I am not inclined to pursue with minute diligence the repetition of the same events.
 <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> allowed a general liberty of speech and practice; and the only virtue of his reign is accused by the monks as the cause of his temporal and eternal perdition.
 Superstition and weakness formed the character of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the First, but the saints and images were incapable of supporting their votary on the throne.
 In the purple, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> asserted the name and religion of an Armenian; and the idols, with their seditious adherents, were condemned to a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> exile.
 Their applause would have sanctified the murder of an impious tyrant, but his assassin and successor, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Michael, was tainted from his birth with the <NORP>Phrygian</NORP> heresies: he attempted to mediate between the contending parties; and the intractable spirit of the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> insensibly cast him into the opposite scale.
 His moderation was guarded by timidity; but his son Theophilus, alike ignorant of fear and pity, was the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> and most cruel of the Iconoclasts.
 The enthusiasm of the times ran strongly against them; and the emperors who stemmed the torrent were exasperated and punished by the public hatred.
 After the death of Theophilus, the final victory of the images was achieved by a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> female, his widow Theodora, whom he left the guardian of the empire.
 Her measures were bold and decisive.
 The fiction of a tardy repentance absolved the fame and the soul of her deceased husband; the sentence of the <NORP>Iconoclast</NORP> patriarch was commuted from the loss of his eyes to a whipping of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> lashes: the bishops trembled, the monks shouted, and the festival of orthodoxy preserves the annual memory of the triumph of the images.
 A single question yet remained, whether they are endowed with any proper and inherent sanctity; it was agitated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> of the eleventh century; (81) and as this opinion has the strongest recommendation of absurdity, I am surprised that it was not more explicitly decided in the affirmative.
 In the West, <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> accepted and announced the decrees of the <PERSON>Nicene</PERSON> assembly, which is now revered by the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> as the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> in rank of the general councils.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> were docile to the voice of their father; but the greatest part of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> <NORP>Christians</NORP> were far behind in the race of superstition.
 Reluctance of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and Charlemagne, A.
D.
 794, etc .
 The churches of France, Germany, England, and Spain, steered a middle course between the adoration and the destruction of images, which they admitted into their temples, not as objects of worship, but as lively and useful memorials of faith and history.
 An angry book of controversy was composed and published in the name of Charlemagne: (82) under his authority a synod of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> bishops was assembled at Frankfort: (83) they blamed the fury of the Iconoclasts, but they pronounced a more severe censure against the superstition of the Greeks, and the decrees of their pretended council, which was long despised by the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of the West.
 (84) Among them the worship of images advanced with a silent and insensible progress; but a large atonement is made for their hesitation and delay, by the gross idolatry of the ages which precede the reformation, and of the countries, both in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and America, which are still immersed in the gloom of superstition.
 Final separation of the popes from the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 774-800.
 It was after the <PERSON>Nycene</PERSON> synod, and under the reign of the pious Irene, that the popes consummated the separation of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, by the translation of the empire to the less orthodox Charlemagne.
 They were compelled to choose between the rival nations: religion was not the sole motive of their choice; and while they dissembled the failings of their friends, they beheld, with reluctance and suspicion, the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> virtues of their foes.
 The difference of language and manners had perpetuated the enmity of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> capitals; and they were alienated from each other by the hostile opposition of seventy years.
 In that schism the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had tasted of freedom, and the popes of sovereignty: their submission would have exposed them to the revenge of a jealous tyrant; and the revolution of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had betrayed the impotence, as well as the tyranny, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors had restored the images, but they had not restored the <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> estates (85) and the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> diocese, (86) which the <NORP>Iconociasts</NORP> had torn away from the successors of St.
 Peter; and <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> threatens them with a sentence of excommunication unless they speedily abjure this practical heresy.
 (87) The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were now orthodox; but their religion might be tainted by the breath of the reigning monarch: the <NORP>Franks</NORP> were now contumacious; but a discerning eye might discern their approaching conversion, from the use, to the adoration, of images.
 The name of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> was stained by the polemic acrimony of his scribes; but the conqueror himself conformed, with the temper of a statesman, to the various practice of <GPE>France</GPE> and Italy.
 In his <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> pilgrimages or visits to the Vatican, he embraced the popes in the communion of friendship and piety; knelt before the tomb, and consequently before the image, of the apostle; and joined, without scruple, in all the prayers and processions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> liturgy.
 Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor? Had they a right to alienate his gift of the Exarchate? Had they power to abolish his government of Rome? The title of patrician was below the merit and greatness of Charlemagne; and it was only by reviving the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire that they could pay their obligations or secure their establishment.
 By this decisive measure they would finally eradicate the claims of the Greeks; from the debasement of a provincial town, the majesty of <GPE>Rome</GPE> would be restored: the <NORP>Latin</NORP> <NORP>Christians</NORP> would be united, under a supreme head, in their ancient metropolis; and the conquerors of the <LOC>West</LOC> would receive their crown from the successors of St.
 Peter.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> church would acquire a zealous and respectable advocate; and, under the shadow of the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> power, the bishop might exercise, with honour and safety, the government of the city.
 (88) Coronation of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> as emperor of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of the West, A.
D.
 800, Dec.
 <CARDINAL>25</CARDINAL> .
 Before the ruin of <NORP>Paganism</NORP> in Rome, the competition for a wealthy bishopric had often been productive of tumult and bloodshed.
 The people was less numerous, but the times were more savage, the prize more important, and the chair of St.
 Peter was fiercely disputed by the leading ecclesiastics who aspired to the rank of sovereign.
 The reign of <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> (89) surpasses the measure of past or succeeding ages; (90) the walls of Rome, the sacred patrimony, the ruin of the Lombards, and the friendship of Charlemagne, were the trophies of his fame: he secretly edified the throne of his successors, and displayed in a narrow space the virtues of a great prince.
 His memory was revered; but in the next election, a priest of the Lateran, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Third, was preferred to the nephew and the favourite of Adrian, whom he had promoted to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> dignities of the church.
 Their acquiescence or repentance disguised, above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the blackest intention of revenge, till the day of a procession, when a furious band of conspirators dispersed the unarmed multitude, and assaulted with blows and wounds the sacred person of the pope.
 But their enterprise on his life or liberty was disappointed, perhaps by their own confusion and remorse.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> was left for dead on the ground: on his revival from the swoon, the effect of his loss of blood, he recovered his speech and sight; and this natural event was improved to the miraculous restoration of his eyes and tongue, of which he had been deprived, twice deprived, by the knife of the assassins.
 (91) From his prison he escaped to the Vatican: the duke of <GPE>Spoleto</GPE> hastened to his rescue, <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> sympathized in his injury, and in his camp of <GPE>Paderborn</GPE> in <GPE>Westphalia</GPE> accepted, or solicited, a visit from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> repassed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> with a commission of counts and bishops, the guards of his safety and the judges of his innocence; and it was not without reluctance, that the conqueror of the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> delayed till the ensuing year the personal discharge of this pious office.
 In his <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> pilgrimage, he was received at <GPE>Rome</GPE> with the due honours of king and patrician: <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> was permitted to purge himself by oath of the crimes imputed to his charge: his enemies were silenced, and the sacrilegious attempt against his life was punished by the mild and insufficient penalty of exile.
 On the festival of Christmas, the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> year of the eighth century, <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> appeared in the church of St.
 Peter; and, to gratify the vanity of Rome, he had exchanged the simple dress of his country for the habit of a patrician.
 (92) After the celebration of the holy mysteries, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> suddenly placed a precious crown on his head, (93) and the dome resounded with the acclamations of the people, "Long life and victory to Charles, the most pious Augustus, crowned by God the great and pacific emperor of the Romans!" The head and body of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> were consecrated by the royal unction: after the example of the Caesars, he was saluted or adored by the pontiff: his coronation oath represents a promise to maintain the faith and privileges of the church; and the first-fruits were paid in his rich offerings to the shrine of his apostle.
 In his familiar conversation, the emperor protested the ignorance of the intentions of Leo, which he would have disappointed by his absence on that memorable day.
 But the preparations of the ceremony must have disclosed the secret; and the journey of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> reveals his knowledge and expectation: he had acknowledged that the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> title was the object of his ambition, and a <NORP>Roman</NORP> synod had pronounced, that it was the only adequate reward of his merit and services.
 (94) Reign and character of Charlemagne, A.
D.
 768-814 .
 The appellation of great has been often bestowed, and sometimes deserved; but CHARLEMAGNE is the only prince in whose favour the title has been indissolubly blended with the name.
 That name, with the addition of saint, is inserted in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> calendar; and the saint, by a rare felicity, is crowned with the praises of the historians and philosophers of an enlightened age.
 (95) His real merit is doubtless enhanced by the barbarism of the nation and the times from which he emerged: but the apparent magnitude of an object is likewise enlarged by an unequal comparison; and the ruins of <LOC>Palmyra</LOC> derive a casual splendour from the nakedness of the surrounding desert.
 Without injustice to his fame, I may discern some blemishes in the sanctity and greatness of the restorer of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 Of his moral virtues, chastity is not the most conspicuous: (96) but the public happiness could not be materially injured by his <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> wives or concubines, the various indulgence of meaner or more transient amours, the multitude of his bastards whom he bestowed on the church, and the long celibacy and licentious manners of his daughters, (97) whom the father was suspected of loving with too fond a passion.
 I shall be scarcely permitted to accuse the ambition of a conqueror; but in a day of equal retribution, the sons of his brother Carloman, the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> princes of Aquitain, and the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <NORP>Saxons</NORP> who were beheaded on the same spot, would have something to allege against the justice and humanity of Charlemagne.
 His treatment of the vanquished <NORP>Saxons</NORP> (98) was an abuse of the right of conquest; his laws were not less sanguinary than his arms, and in the discussion of his motives, whatever is subtracted from bigotry must be imputed to temper.
 The sedentary reader is amazed by his incessant activity of mind and body; and his subjects and enemies were not less astonished at his sudden presence, at the moment when they believed him at the most distant extremity of the empire; neither peace nor war, nor summer nor winter, were a season of repose; and our fancy cannot easily reconcile the annals of his reign with the geography of his expeditions.
 But this activity was a national, rather than a personal, virtue; the vagrant life of a <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> was spent in the chase, in pilgrimage, in military adventures; and the journeys of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> were distinguished only by a more numerous train and a more important purpose.
 His military renown must be tried by the scrutiny of his troops, his enemies, and his actions.
 <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> conquered with the arms of Philip, but the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> heroes who preceded <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> bequeathed him their name, their examples, and the companions of their victories.
 At the head of his veteran and superior armies, he oppressed the savage or degenerate nations, who were incapable of confederating for their common safety: nor did he ever encounter an equal antagonist in numbers, in discipline, or in arms The science of war has been lost and revived with the arts of peace; but his campaigns are not illustrated by any siege or battle of singular difficulty and success; and he might behold, with envy, the <NORP>Saracen</NORP> trophies of his grandfather.
 After the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> expedition, his rear-guard was defeated in the <NORP>Pyrenaean</NORP> mountains; and the soldiers, whose situation was irretrievable, and whose valour was useless, might accuse, with their <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> breath, the want of skill or caution of their general.
 (99) I touch with reverence the laws of Charlemagne, so highly applauded by a respectable judge.
 They compose not a system, but a series, of occasional and minute edicts, for the correction of abuses, the reformation of manners, the economy of his farms, the care of his poultry, and even the sale of his eggs.
 He wished to improve the laws and the character of the Franks; and his attempts, however feeble and imperfect, are deserving of praise: the inveterate evils of the times were suspended or mollified by his government; (100) but in his institutions I can seldom discover the general views and the immortal spirit of a legislator, who survives himself for the benefit of posterity.
 The union and stability of his empire depended on the life of a single man: he imitated the dangerous practice of dividing his kingdoms among his sons; and after his numerous diets, the whole constitution was left to fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and despotism.
 His esteem for the piety and knowledge of the clergy tempted him to intrust that aspiring order with temporal dominion and civil jurisdiction; and his son Lewis, when he was stripped and degraded by the bishops, might accuse, in some measure, the imprudence of his father.
 His laws enforced the imposition of tithes, because the daemons had proclaimed in the air that the default of payment had been the cause of the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> scarcity.
 (101) The literary merits of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> are attested by the foundation of schools, the introduction of arts, the works which were published in his name, and his familiar connection with the subjects and strangers whom he invited to his court to educate both the prince and people.
 His own studies were tardy, laborious, and imperfect; if he spoke Latin, and understood Greek, he derived the rudiments of knowledge from conversation, rather than from books; and, in his mature age, the emperor strove to acquire the practice of writing, which every peasant now learns in his infancy.
 (102) The grammar and logic, the music and astronomy, of the times, were only cultivated as the handmaids of superstition; but the curiosity of the human mind must ultimately tend to its improvement, and the encouragement of learning reflects the purest and most pleasing lustre on the character of Charlemagne.
 (103) The dignity of his person, (104) the length of his reign, the prosperity of his arms, the vigour of his government, and the reverence of distant nations, distinguish him from the royal crowd; and <LOC>Europe</LOC> dates a new aera from his restoration of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 Extent of his empire.
 That empire was not unworthy of its title; (105) and some of the fairest kingdoms of <LOC>Europe</LOC> were the patrimony or conquest of a prince, who reigned at the same time in France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Hungary.
 (106) France.
 I.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> province of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> had been transformed into the name and monarchy of France; but, in the decay of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> line, its limits were contracted by the independence of the <NORP>Britons</NORP> and the revolt of Aquitain.
 <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> pursued, and confined, the <NORP>Britons</NORP> on the shores of the ocean; and that ferocious tribe, whose origin and language are so different from the French, was chastised by the imposition of tribute, hostages, and peace.
 After a long and evasive contest, the rebellion of the dukes of <GPE>Aquitain</GPE> was punished by the forfeiture of their province, their liberty, and their lives.
 Harsh and rigorous would have been such treatment of ambitious governors, who had too faithfully copied the mayors of the palace.
 But a recent discovery (107) has proved that these unhappy princes were the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> and lawful heirs of the blood and sceptre of Clovis, and younger branch, from the brother of Dagobert, of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> house.
 Their ancient kingdom was reduced to the duchy of Gascogne, to the counties of <GPE>Fesenzac</GPE> and Armagnac, at the foot of the Pyrenees: their race was propagated till the beginning of the sixteenth century; and after surviving their <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> tyrants, they were reserved to feel the injustice, or the favours, of a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> dynasty.
 By the reunion of Aquitain, <GPE>France</GPE> was enlarged to its present boundaries, with the additions of the <GPE>Netherlands</GPE> and Spain, as far as the Rhine.
 <GPE>Spain</GPE> .
 II.
 The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> had been expelled from <GPE>France</GPE> by the grandfather and father of Charlemagne; but they still possessed the greatest part of SPAIN, from the rock of <GPE>Gibraltar</GPE> to the Pyrenees.
 Amidst their civil divisions, an <NORP>Arabian</NORP> emir of <PERSON>Saragossa</PERSON> implored his protection in the diet of Paderborn.
 <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> undertook the expedition, restored the emir, and, without distinction of faith, impartially crushed the resistance of the Christians, and rewarded the obedience and services of the Mahometans.
 In his absence he instituted the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> march, (108) which extended from the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to the River Ebro: <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> was the residence of the <NORP>French</NORP> governor: he possessed the counties of <GPE>Rousillon</GPE> and Catalonia; and the infant kingdoms of <GPE>Navarre</GPE> and <GPE>Arragon</GPE> were subject to his jurisdiction.
 III.
 <GPE>Italy</GPE> .
As king of the Lombards, and patrician of Rome, he reigned over the greatest part of ITALY, (109) a tract of a thousand miles from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to the borders of Calabria.
 The duchy of Beneventum, a <PERSON>Lombard</PERSON> fief, had spread, at the expense of the Greeks, over the modern kingdom of Naples.
 But Arrechis, the reigning duke, refused to be included in the slavery of his country; assumed the independent title of prince; and opposed his sword to the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> monarchy.
 His defence was firm, his submission was not inglorious, and the emperor was content with an easy tribute, the demolition of his fortresses, and the acknowledgement, on his coins, of a supreme lord.
 The artful flattery of his son <PERSON>Grimoald</PERSON> added the appellation of father, but he asserted his dignity with prudence, and <PERSON>Benventum</PERSON> insensibly escaped from the <NORP>French</NORP> yoke.
 (110) IV.
 <GPE>Germany</GPE> .
Charlemagne was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who united <GPE>GERMANY</GPE> under the same sceptre.
 The name of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> <GPE>France</GPE> is preserved in the circle of Franconia; and the people of <GPE>Hesse</GPE> and <GPE>Thuringia</GPE> were recently incorporated with the victors, by the conformity of religion and government.
 The Alemanni, so formidable to the Romans, were the faithful vassals and confederates of the Franks; and their country was inscribed within the modern limits of Alsace, Swabia, and Switzerland.
 The Bavarians, with a similar indulgence of their laws and manners, were less patient of a master: the repeated treasons of <PERSON>Tasillo</PERSON> justified the abolition of their hereditary dukes; and their power was shared among the counts, who judged and guarded that important frontier.
 But the north of Germany, from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and beyond the Elbe, was still hostile and Pagan; nor was it till after a war of thirty-three years that the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> bowed under the yoke of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and of Charlemagne.
 The idols and their votaries were extirpated: the foundation of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> bishoprics, of Munster, Osnaburgh, Paderborn, and Minden, of Bremen, Verden, Hildesheim, and Halberstadt, define, on either side of the Weser, the bounds of ancient <GPE>Saxony</GPE> these episcopal seats were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> schools and cities of that savage land; and the religion and humanity of the children atoned, in some degree, for the massacre of the parents.
 Beyond the Elbe, the Slavi, or Sclavonians, of similar manners and various denominations, overspread the modern dominions of Prussia, Poland, and Bohemia, and some transient marks of obedience have tempted the <NORP>French</NORP> historian to extend the empire to the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> and the Vistula.
 The conquest or conversion of those countries is of a more recent age; but the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> union of <GPE>Bohemia</GPE> with the <NORP>Germanic</NORP> body may be justly ascribed to the arms of Charlemagne.
 V.
 <GPE>Hungary</GPE> .
 He retaliated on the Avars, or <NORP>Huns</NORP> of Pannonia, the same calamities which they had inflicted on the nations.
 Their rings, the wooden fortifications which encircled their districts and villages, were broken down by the triple effort of a <NORP>French</NORP> army, that was poured into their country by land and water, through the Carpathian mountains and along the plain of the Danube.
 After a bloody conflict of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> years, the loss of some <NORP>French</NORP> generals was avenged by the slaughter of the most noble Huns: the relics of the nation submitted the royal residence of the chagan was left desolate and unknown; and the treasures, the rapine of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years, enriched the victorious troops, or decorated the churches of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Gaul.
 (111) After the reduction of Pannonia, the empire of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> was bounded only by the conflux of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> with the <NORP>Teyss</NORP> and the Save: the provinces of Istria, Liburnia, and Dalmatia, were an easy, though unprofitable, accession; and it was an effect of his moderation, that he left the maritime cities under the real or nominal sovereignty of the Greeks.
 But these distant possessions added more to the reputation than to the power of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> emperor; nor did he risk any ecclesiastical foundations to reclaim the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> from their vagrant life and idolatrous worship.
 Some canals of communication between the rivers, the <LOC>Saone</LOC> and the Meuse, the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and the Danube, were faintly attempted.
 (112) Their execution would have vivified the empire; and more cost and labor were often wasted in the structure of a cathedral.
 His neighbours and enemies .
 If we retrace the outlines of this geographical picture, it will be seen that the empire of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> extended, between east and west, from the <LOC>Ebro</LOC> to the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> or Vistula; between the north and south, from the duchy of <GPE>Beneventum</GPE> to the River Eyder, the perpetual boundary of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Denmark.
 The personal and political importance of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> was magnified by the distress and division of the rest of Europe.
 The islands of Great Britain and <GPE>Ireland</GPE> were disputed by a crowd of princes of <NORP>Saxon</NORP> or <NORP>Scottish</NORP> origin: and, after the loss of Spain, the <NORP>Christian</NORP> and <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kingdom of <GPE>Alphonso</GPE> the <GPE>Chaste</GPE> was confined to the narrow range of the Asturian mountains.
 These petty sovereigns revered the power or virtue of the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> monarch, implored the honour and support of his alliance, and styled him their common parent, the sole and supreme emperor of the West.
 (113) He maintained a more equal intercourse with the caliph Harun al Rashid, (114) whose dominion stretched from <LOC>Africa</LOC> to India, and accepted from his ambassadors a tent, a water-clock, an elephant, and the keys of the Holy Sepulchre.
 It is not easy to conceive the private friendship of a <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> and an Arab, who were strangers to each other's person, and language, and religion: but their public correspondence was founded on vanity, and their remote situation left no room for a competition of interest.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> thirds of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were subject to Charlemagne, and the deficiency was amply supplied by his command of the inaccessible or invincible nations of Germany.
 But in the choice of his enemies, we may be reasonably surprised that he so often preferred the poverty of the north to the riches of the south.
 The <CARDINAL>three-and-thirty</CARDINAL> campaigns laboriously consumed in the woods and morasses of <GPE>Germany</GPE> would have sufficed to assert the amplitude of his title by the expulsion of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> from <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> from Spain.
 The weakness of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> would have insured an easy victory; and the holy crusade against the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> would have been prompted by glory and revenge, and loudly justified by religion and policy.
 Perhaps, in his expeditions beyond the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and the Elbe, he aspired to save his monarchy from the fate of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, to disarm the enemies of civilized society, and to eradicate the seed of future emigrations.
 But it has been wisely observed, that, in a light of precaution, all conquest must be ineffectual, unless it could be universal, since the increasing circle must be involved in a larger sphere of hostility.
 (115) The subjugation of <GPE>Germany</GPE> withdrew the veil which had so long concealed the continent or islands of <LOC>Scandinavia</LOC> from the knowledge of Europe, and awakened the torpid courage of their barbarous natives.
 The fiercest of the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> idolaters escaped from the <NORP>Christian</NORP> tyrant to their brethren of the North; the <LOC>Ocean</LOC> and <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> were covered with their piratical fleets; and <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> beheld with a sigh the destructive progress of the Normans, who, in less than seventy years, precipitated the fall of his race and monarchy.
 His successors.
 A.
D.
 814-887 in Italy; <CARDINAL>911</CARDINAL> in Germany; <CARDINAL>987</CARDINAL> in <GPE>France</GPE> .
 Had the pope and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> revived the primitive constitution, the titles of emperor and <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> were conferred on <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> for the term of his life; and his successors, on each vacancy, must have ascended the throne by a formal or tacit election.
 But the association of his son <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> the <PERSON>Pious</PERSON> asserts the independent right of monarchy and conquest, and the emperor seems on this occasion to have foreseen and prevented the latent claims of the clergy.
 A.
D.
 813.
 The royal youth was commanded to take the crown from the altar, and with his own hands to place it on his head, as a gift which he held from God, his father, and the nation.
 (116) The same ceremony was repeated, though with less energy, in the subsequent associations of <GPE>Lothaire</GPE> and <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> the Second: the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> sceptre was transmitted from father to son in a lineal descent of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> generations; and the ambition of the popes was reduced to the empty honour of crowning and anointing these hereditary princes, who were already invested with their power and dominions.
 <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> the Pious, A.
D.
 814-840 .
The pious <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> survived his brothers, and embraced the whole empire of Charlemagne; but the nations and the nobles, his bishops and his children, quickly discerned that this mighty mass was no longer inspired by the same soul; and the foundations were undermined to the centre, while the external surface was yet fair and entire.
 After a war, or battle, which consumed <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand Franks, the empire was divided by treaty between his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons, who had violated every filial and fraternal duty.
 <GPE>Lothaire</GPE> I A.
D.
 840-856 .
 The kingdoms of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and <GPE>France</GPE> were forever separated; the provinces of Gaul, between the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and the Alps, the <FAC>Meuse</FAC> and the Rhine, were assigned, with Italy, to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity of Lothaire.
 In the partition of his share, <PERSON>Lorraine</PERSON> and Arles, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> recent and transitory kingdoms, were bestowed on the younger children; <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> II.
 A.
D.
 856-875 and <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> the Second, his eldest son, was content with the realm of Italy, the proper and sufficient patrimony of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 On his death without any male issue, the vacant throne was disputed by his uncles and cousins, and the popes most dexterously seized the occasion of judging the claims and merits of the candidates, and of bestowing on the most obsequious, or most liberal, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> office of advocate of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church.
 The dregs of the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> race no longer exhibited any symptoms of virtue or power, and the ridiculous epithets of the bald, the stammerer, the fat, and the simple, distinguished the tame and uniform features of a crowd of kings alike deserving of oblivion.
 Division of the empire, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>888</CARDINAL> .
 By the failure of the collateral branches, the whole inheritance devolved to <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the Fat, the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> emperor of his family: his insanity authorized the desertion of Germany, Italy, and France: he was deposed in a diet, and solicited his <DATE>daily</DATE> bread from the rebels by whose contempt his life and liberty had been spared.
 According to the measure of their force, the governors, the bishops, and the lords, usurped the fragments of the falling empire; and some preference was shown to the female or illegitimate blood of Charlemagne.
 Of the greater part, the title and possession were alike doubtful, and the merit was adequate to the contracted scale of their dominions.
 Those who could appear with an army at the gates of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were crowned emperors in the Vatican; but their modesty was more frequently satisfied with the appellation of kings of Italy: and the whole term of seventy-four years may be deemed a vacancy, from the abdication of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the Fat to the establishment of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the First.
 <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> restores and appropriates the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>962</CARDINAL> .
 <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> (117) was of the noble race of the dukes of Saxony; and if he truly descended from Witikind, the adversary and proselyte of Charlemagne, the posterity of a vanquished people was exalted to reign over their conquerors.
 His father, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Fowler, was elected, by the suffrage of the nation, to save and institute the kingdom of Germany.
 Its limits (118) were enlarged on every side by his son, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and greatest of the Othos.
 A portion of Gaul, to the west of the Rhine, along the banks of the <FAC>Meuse</FAC> and the Moselle, was assigned to the Germans, by whose blood and language it has been tinged since the time of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Tacitus.
 Between the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Alps, the successors of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> acquired a vain supremacy over the broken kingdoms of <PERSON>Burgundy</PERSON> and Arles.
 In the North, <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was propagated by the sword of Otho, the conqueror and apostle of the <NORP>Slavic</NORP> nations of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Oder: the marches of <GPE>Brandenburgh</GPE> and <LOC>Sleswick</LOC> were fortified with <NORP>German</NORP> colonies; and the king of Denmark, the dukes of <GPE>Poland</GPE> and Bohemia, confessed themselves his tributary vassals.
 At the head of a victorious army, he passed the Alps, subdued the kingdom of Italy, delivered the pope, and forever fixed the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown in the name and nation of Germany.
 From that memorable aera, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> maxims of public jurisprudence were introduced by force and ratified by time.
 I.
 That the prince, who was elected in the <NORP>German</NORP> diet, acquired, from that instant, the subject kingdoms of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome.
 II.
 But that he might not legally assume the titles of emperor and Augustus, till he had received the crown from the hands of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 (119) Transactions of the <NORP>Western</NORP> and <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empires .
 The <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> was announced to the <LOC>East</LOC> by the alteration of his style; and instead of saluting his fathers, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors, he presumed to adopt the more equal and familiar appellation of brother.
 (120) Perhaps in his connection with <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> he aspired to the name of husband: his embassy to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> spoke the language of peace and friendship, and might conceal a treaty of marriage with that ambitious princess, who had renounced the most sacred duties of a mother.
 The nature, the duration, the probable consequences of such a union between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> distant and dissonant empires, it is impossible to conjecture; but the unanimous silence of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> may teach us to suspect, that the report was invented by the enemies of Irene, to charge her with the guilt of betraying the church and state to the strangers of the West.
 (121) The <NORP>French</NORP> ambassadors were the spectators, and had nearly been the victims, of the conspiracy of Nicephorus, and the national hatred.
 <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was exasperated by the treason and sacrilege of ancient Rome: a proverb, "That the <NORP>Franks</NORP> were good friends and bad neighbours," was in every one's mouth; but it was dangerous to provoke a neighbour who might be tempted to reiterate, in the church of St.
 Sophia, the ceremony of his <NORP>Imperial</NORP> coronation.
 After a tedious journey of circuit and delay, the ambassadors of <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> found him in his camp, on the banks of the River Sala; and <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> affected to confound their vanity by displaying, in a <NORP>Franconian</NORP> village, the pomp, or at least the pride, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace.
 (122) The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were successively led through <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> halls of audience: in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> they were ready to fall prostrate before a splendid personage in a chair of state, till he informed them that he was only a servant, the constable, or master of the horse, of the emperor.
 The same mistake, and the same answer, were repeated in the apartments of the count palatine, the steward, and the chamberlain; and their impatience was gradually heightened, till the doors of the presence-chamber were thrown open, and they beheld the genuine monarch, on his throne, enriched with the foreign luxury which he despised, and encircled with the love and reverence of his victorious chiefs.
 A treaty of peace and alliance was concluded between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, and the limits of the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> were defined by the right of present possession.
 But the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (123) soon forgot this humiliating equality, or remembered it only to hate the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> by whom it was extorted.
 During the short union of virtue and power, they respectfully saluted the august Charlemagne, with the acclamations of basileus, and emperor of the Romans.
 As soon as these qualities were separated in the person of his pious son, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> letters were inscribed, "To the king, or, as he styles himself, the emperor of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and Lombards.
" When both power and virtue were extinct, they despoiled <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of his hereditary title, and with the barbarous appellation of rex or rega, degraded him among the crowd of <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes.
 His reply (124) is expressive of his weakness: he proves, with some learning, that, both in sacred and profane history, the name of king is synonymous with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> word basileus: if, at Constantinople, it were assumed in a more exclusive and imperial sense, he claims from his ancestors, and from the popes, a just participation of the honours of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> purple.
 The same controversy was revived in the reign of the Othos; and their ambassador describes, in lively colours, the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (125) The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> affected to despise the poverty and ignorance of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and Saxons; and in their <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> decline refused to prostitute to the kings of <GPE>Germany</GPE> the title of <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors.
 Authority of the emperors in the elections of the popes, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>800-1060</CARDINAL> .
 These emperors, in the election of the popes, continued to exercise the powers which had been assumed by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> and <NORP>Grecian</NORP> princes; and the importance of this prerogative increased with the temporal estate and spiritual jurisdiction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church.
 In the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aristocracy, the principal members of the clergy still formed a senate to assist the administration, and to supply the vacancy, of the bishop.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was divided into <CARDINAL>twenty-eight</CARDINAL> parishes, and each parish was governed by a cardinal priest, or presbyter, a title which, however common or modest in its origin, has aspired to emulate the purple of kings.
 Their number was enlarged by the association of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> deacons of the most considerable hospitals, the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> palatine judges of the Lateran, and some dignitaries of the church.
 This ecclesiastical senate was directed by the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> cardinal-bishops of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> province, who were less occupied in the suburb dioceses of Ostia, Porto, Velitrae, Tusculum, Praeneste, Tibur, and the Sabines, than by their <DATE>weekly</DATE> service in the Lateran, and their superior share in the honours and authority of the apostolic see.
 On the death of the pope, these bishops recommended a successor to the suffrage of the college of cardinals, (126) and their choice was ratified or rejected by the applause or clamour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 But the election was imperfect; nor could the pontiff be legally consecrated till the emperor, the advocate of the church, had graciously signified his approbation and consent.
 The royal commissioner examined, on the spot, the form and freedom of the proceedings; nor was it till after a previous scrutiny into the qualifications of the candidates, that he accepted an oath of fidelity, and confirmed the donations which had successively enriched the patrimony of St.
 Peter.
 In the frequent schisms, the rival claims were submitted to the sentence of the emperor; and in a synod of bishops he presumed to judge, to condemn, and to punish, the crimes of a guilty pontiff.
 <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> imposed a treaty on the senate and people, who engaged to prefer the candidate most acceptable to his majesty: (127) his successors anticipated or prevented their choice: they bestowed the <NORP>Roman</NORP> benefice, like the bishoprics of <GPE>Cologne</GPE> or Bamberg, on their chancellors or preceptors; and whatever might be the merit of a <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> or Saxon, his name sufficiently attests the interposition of foreign power.
 These acts of prerogative were most speciously excused by the vices of a popular election.
 The competitor who had been excluded by the cardinals appealed to the passions or avarice of the multitude; the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> were stained with blood; and the most powerful senators, the marquises of <GPE>Tuscany</GPE> and the counts of Tusculum, held the apostolic see in a long and disgraceful servitude.
 Disorders .
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiffs, of the ninth and tenth centuries, were insulted, imprisoned, and murdered, by their tyrants; and such was their indigence, after the loss and usurpation of the ecclesiastical patrimonies, that they could neither support the state of a prince, nor exercise the charity of a priest.
 (128) The influence of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sister prostitutes, <PERSON>Marozia</PERSON> and Theodora, was founded on their wealth and beauty, their political and amorous intrigues: the most strenuous of their lovers were rewarded with the <NORP>Roman</NORP> mitre, and their reign (129) may have suggested to the darker ages (130) the fable (131) of a female pope.
 (132) The bastard son, the grandson, and the great-grandson of Marozia, a rare genealogy, were seated in the chair of St.
 Peter, and it was at the age of nineteen years that the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> of these became the head of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church.
 His youth and manhood were of a suitable complexion; and the nations of pilgrims could bear testimony to the charges that were urged against him in a <NORP>Roman</NORP> synod, and in the presence of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the Great.
 As John XII.
 had renounced the dress and decencies of his profession, the soldier may not perhaps be dishonoured by the wine which he drank, the blood that he spilt, the flames that he kindled, or the licentious pursuits of gaming and hunting.
 His open simony might be the consequence of distress; and his blasphemous invocation of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> and Venus, if it be true, could not possibly be serious.
 But we read, with some surprise, that the worthy grandson of <PERSON>Marozia</PERSON> lived in public adultery with the matrons of Rome; that the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> palace was turned into a school for prostitution, and that his rapes of virgins and widows had deterred the female pilgrims from visiting the tomb of St.
 Peter, lest, in the devout act, they should be violated by his successor.
 (133) The <NORP>Protestants</NORP> have dwelt with malicious pleasure on these characters of Antichrist; but to a philosophic eye, the vices of the clergy are far less dangerous than their virtues.
 Reformation and claims of the church, A.
D.
 1073, etc.
 After a long series of scandal, the apostolic see was reformed and exalted by the austerity and zeal of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> VII.
 That ambitious monk devoted his life to the execution of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> projects.
 I.
 To fix in the college of cardinals the freedom and independence of election, and forever to abolish the right or usurpation of the emperors and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 II.
 To bestow and resume the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire as a fief or benefice (134) of the church, and to extend his temporal dominion over the kings and kingdoms of the earth.
 After a contest of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these designs was accomplished by the firm support of the ecclesiastical order, whose liberty was connected with that of their chief.
 But the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attempt, though it was crowned with some partial and apparent success, has been vigorously resisted by the secular power, and finally extinguished by the improvement of human reason.
 Authority of the emperors in <GPE>Rome</GPE> .
 In the revival of the empire of empire of Rome, neither the bishop nor the people could bestow on <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> or <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the provinces which were lost, as they had been won, by the chance of arms.
 But the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were free to choose a master for themselves; and the powers which had been delegated to the patrician, were irrevocably granted to the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Saxon</NORP> emperors of the West.
 The broken records of the times (135) preserve some remembrance of their palace, their mint, their tribunal, their edicts, and the sword of justice, which, as late as the thirteenth century, was derived from <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> to the praefect of the city.
 (136) Between the arts of the popes and the violence of the people, this supremacy was crushed and annihilated.
 Content with the titles of emperor and Augustus, the successors of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> neglected to assert this local jurisdiction.
 In the hour of prosperity, their ambition was diverted by more alluring objects; and in the decay and division of the empire, they were oppressed by the defence of their hereditary provinces.
 Revolt of Alberic, A.
D.
 932 Amidst the ruins of Italy, the famous <PERSON>Marozia</PERSON> invited <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the usurpers to assume the character of her <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> husband; and Hugh, king of <PERSON>Burgundy</PERSON> was introduced by her faction into the mole of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> or <PERSON>Castle</PERSON> of St.
 Angelo, which commands the principal bridge and entrance of Rome.
 Her son by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> marriage, Alberic, was compelled to attend at the nuptial banquet; but his reluctant and ungraceful service was chastised with a blow by his new father.
 The blow was productive of a revolution.
 "Romans," exclaimed the youth, "once you were the masters of the world, and these <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> the most abject of your slaves.
 They now reign, these voracious and brutal savages, and my injury is the commencement of your servitude.
" (137) The alarum bell rang to arms in every quarter of the city: the <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> retreated with haste and shame; <PERSON>Marozia</PERSON> was imprisoned by her victorious son, and his brother, <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> John XI.
, was reduced to the exercise of his spiritual functions.
 With the title of prince, <PERSON>Alberic</PERSON> possessed above twenty years the government of Rome; and he is said to have gratified the popular prejudice, by restoring the office, or at least the title, of consuls and tribunes.
 His son and heir <PERSON>Octavian</PERSON> assumed, with the pontificate, the name of John XII.
: like his predecessor, he was provoked by the <PERSON>Lombard</PERSON> princes to seek a deliverer for the church and republic; and the services of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> were rewarded with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity.
 But the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> was imperious, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were impatient, the festival of the coronation was disturbed by the secret conflict of prerogative and freedom, and <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> commanded his sword-bearer not to stir from his person, lest he should be assaulted and murdered at the foot of the altar.
 (138)of pope John XII.
 A.
D.
 967.
 Before he repassed the Alps, the emperor chastised the revolt of the people and the ingratitude of John XII.
 The pope was degraded in a synod; the praefect was mounted on an ass, whipped through the city, and cast into a dungeon; <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> of the most guilty were hanged, others were mutilated or banished; and this severe process was justified by the ancient laws of <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> and Justinian.
 The voice of fame has accused the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> of a perfidious and bloody act, the massacre of the senators, whom he had invited to his table under the fair semblance of hospitality and friendship.
 (139) Of the consul Crescentius.
 A.
D.
 998.
 In the minority of his son <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the Third, <GPE>Rome</GPE> made a bold attempt to shake off the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> yoke, and the consul <PERSON>Crescentius</PERSON> was the <PERSON>Brutus</PERSON> of the republic.
 From the condition of a subject and an exile, he twice rose to the command of the city, oppressed, expelled, and created the popes, and formed a conspiracy for restoring the authority of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors.
 In the fortress of St.
 Angelo, he maintained an obstinate siege, till the unfortunate consul was betrayed by a promise of safety: his body was suspended on a gibbet, and his head was exposed on the battlements of the castle.
 By a reverse of fortune, Otho, after separating his troops, was besieged <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days, without food, in his palace; and a disgraceful escape saved him from the justice or fury of the Romans.
 The senator <PERSON>Ptolemy</PERSON> was the leader of the people, and the widow of <PERSON>Crescentius</PERSON> enjoyed the pleasure or the fame of revenging her husband, by a poison which she administered to her <NORP>Imperial</NORP> lover.
 It was the design of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> to abandon the ruder countries of the North, to erect his throne in Italy, and to revive the institutions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarchy.
 But his successors only once in their lives appeared on the banks of the Tyber, to receive their crown in the Vatican.
 (140) Their absence was contemptible, their presence odious and formidable.
 They descended from the Alps, at the head of their barbarians, who were strangers and enemies to the country; and their transient visit was a scene of tumult and bloodshed.
 (141) A faint remembrance of their ancestors still tormented the Romans; and they beheld with pious indignation the succession of Saxons, Franks, Swabians, and Bohemians, who usurped the purple and prerogatives of the Caesars.
 The kingdom of Italy, A.
D.
 774-1250 .
 There is nothing perhaps more adverse to nature and reason than to hold in obedience remote countries and foreign nations, in opposition to their inclination and interest.
 A torrent of <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> may pass over the earth, but an extensive empire must be supported by a refined system of policy and oppression; in the centre, an absolute power, prompt in action and rich in resources; a swift and easy communication with the extreme parts; fortifications to check the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> effort of rebellion; a regular administration to protect and punish; and a well-disciplined army to inspire fear, without provoking discontent and despair.
 Far different was the situation of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars, who were ambitious to enslave the kingdom of Italy.
 Their patrimonial estates were stretched along the Rhine, or scattered in the provinces; but this ample domain was alienated by the imprudence or distress of successive princes; and their revenue, from minute and vexatious prerogative, was scarcely sufficient for the maintenance of their household.
 Their troops were formed by the legal or voluntary service of their feudal vassals, who passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> with reluctance, assumed the license of rapine and disorder, and capriciously deserted before the end of the campaign.
 Whole armies were swept away by the pestilential influence of the climate: the survivors brought back the bones of their princes and nobles, (142) and the effects of their own intemperance were often imputed to the treachery and malice of the Italians, who rejoiced at least in the calamities of the Barbarians.
 This irregular tyranny might contend on equal terms with the petty tyrants of Italy; nor can the people, or the reader, be much interested in the event of the quarrel.
 But in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> rekindled the flame of industry and freedom; and the generous example was at length imitated by the republics of Tuscany.
 In the <NORP>Italian</NORP> cities a municipal government had never been totally abolished; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> privileges were granted by the favour and policy of the emperors, who were desirous of erecting a plebeian barrier against the independence of the nobles.
 But their rapid progress, the <DATE>daily</DATE> extension of their power and pretensions, were founded on the numbers and spirit of these rising communities.
 (143) Each city filled the measure of her diocese or district: the jurisdiction of the counts and bishops, of the marquises and counts, was banished from the land; and the proudest nobles were persuaded or compelled to desert their solitary castles, and to embrace the more honourable character of freemen and magistrates.
 The legislative authority was inherent in the general assembly; but the executive powers were intrusted to <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> consuls, annually chosen from the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> orders of captains, valvassors, (144) and commons, into which the republic was divided.
 Under the protection of equal law, the labours of agriculture and commerce were gradually revived; but the martial spirit of the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> was nourished by the presence of danger; and as often as the bell was rung, or the standard (145) erected, the gates of the city poured forth a numerous and intrepid band, whose zeal in their own cause was soon guided by the use and discipline of arms.
 At the foot of these popular ramparts, the pride of the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> was overthrown; and the invincible genius of liberty prevailed over the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Frederics, the greatest princes of the middle age; the first, superior perhaps in military prowess; the second, who undoubtedly excelled in the softer accomplishments of peace and learning.
 <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the first, A.
D.
 1152-1190.
 Ambitious of restoring the splendour of the purple, <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> invaded the republics of Lombardy, with the arts of a statesman, the valour of a soldier, and the cruelty of a tyrant.
 The recent discovery of the <PERSON>Pandects</PERSON> had renewed a science most favourable to despotism; and his venal advocates proclaimed the emperor the absolute master of the lives and properties of his subjects.
 His royal prerogatives, in a less odious sense, were acknowledged in the diet of Roncaglia; and the revenue of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was fixed at thirty thousand pounds of silver, (146) which were multiplied to an indefinite demand by the rapine of the fiscal officers.
 The obstinate cities were reduced by the terror or the force of his arms: his captives were delivered to the executioner, or shot from his military engines; and.
 after the siege and surrender of Milan, the buildings of that stately capital were razed to the ground, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> hostages were sent into Germany, and the inhabitants were dispersed in <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> villages, under the yoke of the inflexible conqueror.
 (147) But <GPE>Milan</GPE> soon rose from her ashes; and the league of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> was cemented by distress: their cause was espoused by Venice, <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor: the fabric of oppression was overturned in a day; and in the treaty of Constance, <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> subscribed, with some reservations, the freedom of <CARDINAL>four-and-twenty</CARDINAL> cities.
 His grandson contended with their vigour and maturity; but <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> II.
, A.
D.
 1198-1250.
 <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> (148) was endowed with some personal and peculiar advantages.
 His birth and education recommended him to the Italians; and in the implacable discord of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions, the <NORP>Ghibelins</NORP> were attached to the emperor, while the <PERSON>Guelfs</PERSON> displayed the banner of liberty and the church.
 The court of <GPE>Rome</GPE> had slumbered, when his father <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth was permitted to unite with the empire the kingdoms of <GPE>Naples</GPE> and Sicily; and from these hereditary realms the son derived an ample and ready supply of troops and treasure.
 Yet <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> was finally oppressed by the arms of the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> and the thunders of the Vatican: his kingdom was given to a stranger, and the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> of his family was beheaded at <GPE>Naples</GPE> on a public scaffold.
 During sixty years, no emperor appeared in Italy, and the name was remembered only by the ignominious sale of the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> relics of sovereignty.
 Independence of the princes of Germany, A.
D.
 814-1250,etc .
 The <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> conquerors of the <LOC>West</LOC> were pleased to decorate their chief with the title of emperor; but it was not their design to invest him with the despotism of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Justinian.
 The persons of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> were free, their conquests were their own, and their national character was animated by a spirit which scorned the servile jurisprudence of the new or the ancient Rome.
 It would have been a vain and dangerous attempt to impose a monarch on the armed freemen, who were impatient of a magistrate; on the bold, who refused to obey; on the powerful, who aspired to command.
 The empire of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> was distributed among the dukes of the nations or provinces, the counts of the smaller districts, and the margraves of the marches or frontiers, who all united the civil and military authority as it had been delegated to the lieutenants of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Caesars.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> governors, who, for the most part, were soldiers of fortune, seduced their mercenary legions, assumed the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, and either failed or succeeded in their revolt, without wounding the power and unity of government.
 If the dukes, margraves, and counts of Germany, were less audacious in their claims, the consequences of their success were more lasting and pernicious to the state.
 Instead of aiming at the supreme rank, they silently labored to establish and appropriate their provincial independence.
 Their ambition was seconded by the weight of their estates and vassals, their mutual example and support, the common interest of the subordinate nobility, the change of princes and families, the minorities of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Fourth, the ambition of the popes, and the vain pursuit of the fugitive crowns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome.
 All the attributes of regal and territorial jurisdiction were gradually usurped by the commanders of the provinces; the right of peace and war, of life and death, of coinage and taxation, of foreign alliance and domestic economy.
 Whatever had been seized by violence, was ratified by favour or distress, was granted as the price of a doubtful vote or a voluntary service; whatever had been granted to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> could not, without injury, be denied to his successor or equal; and every act of local or temporary possession was insensibly moulded into the constitution of the <NORP>Germanic</NORP> kingdom.
 In every province, the visible presence of the duke or count was interposed between the throne and the nobles; the subjects of the law became the vassals of a private chief; and the standard which he received from his sovereign, was often raised against him in the field.
 The temporal power of the clergy was cherished and exalted by the superstition or policy of the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> and <NORP>Saxon</NORP> dynasties, who blindly depended on their moderation and fidelity; and the bishoprics of <GPE>Germany</GPE> were made equal in extent and privilege, superior in wealth and population, to the most ample states of the military order.
 As long as the emperors retained the prerogative of bestowing on every vacancy these ecclesiastic and secular benefices, their cause was maintained by the gratitude or ambition of their friends and favourites.
 But in the quarrel of the investitures, they were deprived of their influence over the episcopal chapters; the freedom of election was restored, and the sovereign was reduced, by a solemn mockery, to his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> prayers, the recommendation, once in his reign, to a single prebend in each church.
 The secular governors, instead of being recalled at the will of a superior, could be degraded only by the sentence of their peers.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age of the monarchy, the appointment of the son to the duchy or county of his father, was solicited as a favour; it was gradually obtained as a custom, and extorted as a right: the lineal succession was often extended to the collateral or female branches; the states of the empire (their popular, and at length their legal, appellation) were divided and alienated by testament and sale; and all idea of a public trust was lost in that of a private and perpetual inheritance.
 The emperor could not even be enriched by the casualties of forfeiture and extinction: within the term of a year, he was obliged to dispose of the vacant fief; and, in the choice of the candidate, it was his duty to consult either the general or the provincial diet.
 The <NORP>Germanic</NORP> constitution, A.
D.
 1250.
 After the death of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, <GPE>Germany</GPE> was left a monster with a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> heads.
 A crowd of princes and prelates disputed the ruins of the empire: the lords of innumerable castles were less prone to obey, than to imitate, their superiors; and, according to the measure of their strength, their incessant hostilities received the names of conquest or robbery.
 Such anarchy was the inevitable consequence of the laws and manners of Europe; and the kingdoms of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> were shivered into fragments by the violence of the same tempest.
 But the <NORP>Italian</NORP> cities and the <NORP>French</NORP> vassals were divided and destroyed, while the union of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> has produced, under the name of an empire, a great system of a federative republic.
 In the frequent and at <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> the perpetual institution of diets, a national spirit was kept alive, and the powers of a common legislature are still exercised by the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> branches or colleges of the electors, the princes, and the free and <NORP>Imperial</NORP> cities of Germany.
 I.
 <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> of the most powerful feudatories were permitted to assume, with a distinguished name and rank, the exclusive privilege of choosing the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor; and these electors were the king of Bohemia, the duke of Saxony, the margrave of Brandenburgh, the count palatine of the Rhine, and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> archbishops of Mentz, of Treves, and of Cologne.
 II.
 The college of princes and prelates purged themselves of a promiscuous multitude: they reduced to <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> representative votes the long series of independent counts, and excluded the nobles or equestrian order, sixty thousand of whom, as in the <NORP>Polish</NORP> diets, had appeared on horseback in the field of election.
 III.
 The pride of birth and dominion, of the sword and the mitre, wisely adopted the commons as the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> branch of the legislature, and, in the progress of society, they were introduced about the same aera into the national assemblies of <GPE>France</GPE> England, and Germany.
 The Hanseatic League commanded the trade and navigation of the north: the confederates of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> secured the peace and intercourse of the inland country; the influence of the cities has been adequate to their wealth and policy, and their negative still invalidates the acts of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> superior colleges of electors and princes.
 (149) Weakness and poverty of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> IV.
 A.
D.
 1347-1378 .
 It is in the fourteenth century that we may view in the strongest light the state and contrast of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire of Germany, which no longer held, except on the borders of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and Danube, a single province of <GPE>Trajan</GPE> or Constantine.
 Their unworthy successors were the counts of Hapsburgh, of Nassau, of Luxemburgh, and Schwartzenburgh: the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Seventh procured for his son the crown of Bohemia, and his grandson <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fourth</ORDINAL> was born among a people strange and barbarous in the estimation of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> themselves.
 (150) After the excommunication of <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> of Bavaria, he received the gift or promise of the vacant empire from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiffs, who, in the exile and captivity of Avignon, affected the dominion of the earth.
 The death of his competitors united the electoral college, and <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> was unanimously saluted king of the Romans, and future emperor; a title which, in the same age, was prostituted to the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Greece.
 The <NORP>German</NORP> emperor was no more than the elective and impotent magistrate of an aristocracy of princes, who had not left him a village that he might call his own.
 His best prerogative was the right of presiding and proposing in the national senate, which was convened at his summons; and his native kingdom of Bohemia, less opulent than the adjacent city of Nuremberg, was the firmest seat of his power and the richest source of his revenue.
 A.
D.
 1355 The army with which he passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horse.
 In the cathedral of St.
 Ambrose, <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> was crowned with the iron crown, which tradition ascribed to the <PERSON>Lombard</PERSON> monarchy; but he was admitted only with a peaceful train; the gates of the city were shut upon him; and the king of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was held a captive by the arms of the Visconti, whom he confirmed in the sovereignty of Milan.
 In the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> he was again crowned with the golden crown of the empire; but, in obedience to a secret treaty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor immediately withdrew, without reposing a single night within the walls of Rome.
 The eloquent Petrarch, (151) whose fancy revived the visionary glories of the Capitol, deplores and upbraids the ignominious flight of the Bohemian; and even his contemporaries could observe, that the sole exercise of his authority was in the lucrative sale of privileges and titles.
 The gold of <GPE>Italy</GPE> secured the election of his son; but such was the shameful poverty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor, that his person was arrested by a butcher in the streets of Worms, and was detained in the public inn, as a pledge or hostage for the payment of his expenses.
 His ostentation, A.
D.
 1356 .
 From this humiliating scene, let us turn to the apparent majesty of the same <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> in the diets of the empire.
 The golden bull, which fixes the <NORP>Germanic</NORP> constitution, is promulgated in the style of a sovereign and legislator.
 A <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> princes bowed before his throne, and exalted their own dignity by the voluntary honours which they yielded to their chief or minister.
 At the royal banquet, the hereditary great officers, the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> electors, who in rank and title were equal to kings, performed their solemn and domestic service of the palace.
 The seals of the triple kingdom were borne in state by the archbishops of Mentz, Cologne, and Treves, the perpetual arch-chancellors of Germany, Italy, and Arles.
 The great marshal, on horseback, exercised his function with a silver measure of oats, which he emptied on the ground, and immediately dismounted to regulate the order of the guests The great steward, the count palatine of the Rhine, place the dishes on the table.
 The great chamberlain, the margrave of Brandenburgh, presented, after the repast, the golden ewer and basin, to wash.
 The king of Bohemia, as great cup-bearer, was represented by the emperor's brother, the duke of <NORP>Luxemburgh</NORP> and Brabant; and the procession was closed by the great huntsmen, who introduced a boar and a stag, with a loud chorus of horns and hounds.
 (152) Nor was the supremacy of the emperor confined to <GPE>Germany</GPE> alone: the hereditary monarchs of <LOC>Europe</LOC> confessed the preeminence of his rank and dignity: he was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes, the temporal head of the great republic of the West: (153) to his person the title of majesty was long appropriated; and he disputed with the pope the sublime prerogative of creating kings and assembling councils.
 The oracle of the civil law, the learned Bartolus, was a pensioner of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the Fourth; and his school resounded with the doctrine, that the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor was the rightful sovereign of the earth, from the rising to the setting sun.
 The contrary opinion was condemned, not as an error, but as a heresy, since even the gospel had pronounced, "And there went forth a decree from <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.
" (154) Contrast of the power and modesty of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> .
 If we annihilate the interval of time and space between <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charles, strong and striking will be the contrast between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Caesars; the <NORP>Bohemian</NORP> who concealed his weakness under the mask of ostentation, and the Roman, who disguised his strength under the semblance of modesty.
 At the head of his victorious legions, in his reign over the sea and land, from the <LOC>Nile</LOC> and <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean, <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> professed himself the servant of the state and the equal of his fellow-citizens.
 The conqueror of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and her provinces assumed a popular and legal form of a censor, a consul, and a tribune.
 His will was the law of mankind, but in the declaration of his laws he borrowed the voice of the senate and people; and from their decrees their master accepted and renewed his temporary commission to administer the republic.
 In his dress, his domestics, (155) his titles, in all the offices of social life, <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> maintained the character of a private Roman; and his most artful flatterers respected the secret of his absolute and perpetual monarchy.

D.
 728, etc.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assault of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> against the images of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had been witnessed by a crowd of strangers from <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the West, who related with grief and indignation the sacrilege of the emperor.
 But on the reception of his proscriptive edict, they trembled for their domestic deities: the images of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and the Virgin, of the angels, martyrs, and saints, were abolished in all the churches of Italy; and a strong alternative was proposed to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, the royal favour as the price of his compliance, degradation and exile as the penalty of his disobedience.
 Neither zeal nor policy allowed him to hesitate; and the haughty strain in which <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> addressed the emperor displays his confidence in the truth of his doctrine or the powers of resistance.
 Without depending on prayers or miracles, he boldly armed against the public enemy, and his pastoral letters admonished the <NORP>Italians</NORP> of their danger and their duty.
 (37) At this signal, Ravenna, Venice, and the cities of the <WORK_OF_ART>Exarchate</WORK_OF_ART> and Pentapolis, adhered to the cause of religion; their military force by sea and land consisted, for the most part, of the natives; and the spirit of patriotism and zeal was transfused into the mercenary strangers.
 The <NORP>Italians</NORP> swore to live and die in the defence of the pope and the holy images; the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people was devoted to their father, and even the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> were ambitious to share the merit and advantage of this holy war.
 The most treasonable act, but the most obvious revenge, was the destruction of the statues of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> himself: the most effectual and pleasing measure of rebellion, was the withholding the tribute of Italy, and depriving him of a power which he had recently abused by the imposition of a new capitation.
 (38) A form of administration was preserved by the election of magistrates and governors; and so high was the public indignation, that the <NORP>Italians</NORP> were prepared to create an orthodox emperor, and to conduct him with a fleet and army to the palace of Constantinople.
 In that palace, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> bishops, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> Gregory, were condemned as the authors of the revolt, and every attempt was made, either by fraud or force, to seize their persons, and to strike at their lives.
 The city was repeatedly visited or assaulted by captains of the guards, and dukes and exarchs of high dignity or secret trust; they landed with foreign troops, they obtained some domestic aid, and the superstition of <GPE>Naples</GPE> may blush that her fathers were attached to the cause of heresy.
 But these clandestine or open attacks were repelled by the courage and vigilance of the Romans; the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were overthrown and massacred, their leaders suffered an ignominious death, and the popes, however inclined to mercy, refused to intercede for these guilty victims.
 At Ravenna, (39) the several quarters of the city had long exercised a bloody and hereditary feud; in religious controversy they found a new aliment of faction: but the votaries of images were superior in numbers or spirit, and the exarch, who attempted to stem the torrent, lost his life in a popular sedition.
 To punish this flagitious deed, and restore his dominion in Italy, the emperor sent a fleet and army into the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> Gulf.
 After suffering from the winds and waves much loss and delay, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> made their descent in the neighbourhood of Ravenna: they threatened to depopulate the guilty capital, and to imitate, perhaps to surpass, the example of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> the Second, who had chastised a former rebellion by the choice and execution of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> of the principal inhabitants.
 The women and clergy, in sackcloth and ashes, lay prostrate in prayer: the men were in arms for the defence of their country; the common danger had united the factions, and the event of a battle was preferred to the slow miseries of a siege.
 In a hard-fought day, as the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies alternately yielded and advanced, a phantom was seen, a voice was heard, and <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was victorious by the assurance of victory.
 The strangers retreated to their ships, but the populous sea-coast poured forth a multitude of boats; the waters of the <LOC>Po</LOC> were so deeply infected with blood, that during <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years the public prejudice abstained from the fish of the river; and the institution of an annual feast perpetuated the worship of images, and the abhorrence of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> tyrant.
 Amidst the triumph of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> arms, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff convened a synod of <CARDINAL>ninety-three</CARDINAL> bishops against the heresy of the Iconoclasts.
 With their consent, he pronounced a general excommunication against all who by word or deed should attack the tradition of the fathers and the images of the saints: in this sentence the emperor was tacitly involved, (40) but the vote of a <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> and hopeless remonstrance may seem to imply that the anathema was yet suspended over his guilty head.
 No sooner had they confirmed their own safety, the worship of images, and the freedom of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, than the popes appear to have relaxed of their severity, and to have spared the relics of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> dominion.
 Their moderate councils delayed and prevented the election of a new emperor, and they exhorted the <NORP>Italians</NORP> not to separate from the body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarchy.
 The exarch was permitted to reside within the walls of Ravenna, a captive rather than a master; and till the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> coronation of Charlemagne, the government of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> was exercised in the name of the successors of Constantine.
 (41) Republic of Rome.
 The liberty of Rome, which had been oppressed by the arms and arts of Augustus, was rescued, after <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years of servitude, from the persecution of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Isaurian.
 By the Caesars, the triumphs of the consuls had been annihilated: in the decline and fall of the empire, the god Terminus, the sacred boundary, had insensibly receded from the ocean, the Rhine, the Danube, and the Euphrates; and <GPE>Rome</GPE> was reduced to her ancient territory from <GPE>Viterbo</GPE> to Terracina, and from <GPE>Narni</GPE> to the mouth of the Tyber.
 (42) When the kings were banished, the republic reposed on the firm basis which had been founded by their wisdom and virtue.
 Their perpetual jurisdiction was divided between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> annual magistrates: the senate continued to exercise the powers of administration and counsel; and the legislative authority was distributed in the assemblies of the people, by a well-proportioned scale of property and service.
 Ignorant of the arts of luxury, the primitive <NORP>Romans</NORP> had improved the science of government and war: the will of the community was absolute: the rights of individuals were sacred: <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and thirty thousand citizens were armed for defence or conquest; and a band of robbers and outlaws was moulded into a nation deserving of freedom and ambitious of glory.
 (43) When the sovereignty of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors was extinguished, the ruins of <GPE>Rome</GPE> presented the sad image of depopulation and decay: her slavery was a habit, her liberty an accident; the effect of superstition, and the object of her own amazement and terror.
 The <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> vestige of the substance, or even the forms, of the constitution, was obliterated from the practice and memory of the Romans; and they were devoid of knowledge, or virtue, again to build the fabric of a commonwealth.
 Their scanty remnant, the offspring of slaves and strangers, was despicable in the eyes of the victorious Barbarians.
 As often as the <NORP>Franks</NORP> or <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> expressed their most bitter contempt of a foe, they called him a Roman; By the necessity of their situation, the inhabitants of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were cast into the rough model of a <NORP>republican</NORP> government: they were compelled to elect some judges in peace, and some leaders in war: the nobles assembled to deliberate, and their resolves could not be executed without the union and consent of the multitude.
 The style of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate and people was revived, (45) but the spirit was fled; and their new independence was disgraced by the tumultuous conflict of licentiousness and oppression.
 The want of laws could only be supplied by the influence of religion, and their foreign and domestic counsels were moderated by the authority of the bishop.
 His alms, his sermons, his correspondence with the kings and prelates of the West, his recent services, their gratitude, and oath, accustomed the <NORP>Romans</NORP> to consider him as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate or prince of the city.
 The <NORP>Christian</NORP> humility of the popes was not offended by the name of Dominus, or Lord; and their face and inscription are still apparent on the most ancient coins.
 (46) Their temporal dominion is now confirmed by the reverence of a thousand years; and their noblest title is the free choice of a people, whom they had redeemed from slavery.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> attacked by the Lombards, A.
D.
 730-752 .
 In the quarrels of ancient Greece, the holy people of <GPE>Elis</GPE> enjoyed a perpetual peace, under the protection of Jupiter, and in the exercise of the <EVENT>Olympic</EVENT> games.
 (47) Happy would it have been for the Romans, if a similar privilege had guarded the patrimony of St.
 Peter from the calamities of war; if the Christians, who visited the holy threshold, would have sheathed their swords in the presence of the apostle and his successor.
 But this mystic circle could have been traced only by the wand of a legislator and a sage: this pacific system was incompatible with the zeal and ambition of the popes the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were not addicted, like the inhabitants of Elis, to the innocent and placid labours of agriculture; and the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of Italy, though softened by the climate, were far below the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> states in the institutions of public and private life.
 A memorable example of repentance and piety was exhibited by Liutprand, king of the Lombards.
 In arms, at the gate of the Vatican, the conqueror listened to the voice of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> the Second, (48) withdrew his troops, resigned his conquests, respectfully visited the church of St.
 Peter, and after performing his devotions, offered his sword and dagger, his cuirass and mantle, his silver cross, and his crown of gold, on the tomb of the apostle.
 But this religious fervour was the illusion, perhaps the artifice, of the moment; the sense of interest is strong and lasting; the love of arms and rapine was congenial to the Lombards; and both the prince and people were irresistibly tempted by the disorders of Italy, the nakedness of Rome, and the unwarlike profession of her new chief.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> edicts of the emperor, they declared themselves the champions of the holy images: <GPE>Liutprand</GPE> invaded the province of Romagna, which had already assumed that distinctive appellation; the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> of the <WORK_OF_ART>Exarchate</WORK_OF_ART> yielded without reluctance to his civil and military power; and a foreign enemy was introduced for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time into the impregnable fortress of Ravenna.
 That city and fortress were speedily recovered by the active diligence and maritime forces of the Venetians; and those faithful subjects obeyed the exhortation of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> himself, in separating the personal guilt of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> from the general cause of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (49) The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were less mindful of the service, than the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> of the injury: the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nations, hostile in their faith, were reconciled in a dangerous and unnatural alliance: the king and the exarch marched to the conquest of <GPE>Spoleto</GPE> and Rome: the storm evaporated without effect, but the policy of <GPE>Liutprand</GPE> alarmed <GPE>Italy</GPE> with a vexatious alternative of hostility and truce.
 His successor <PERSON>Astolphus</PERSON> declared himself the equal enemy of the emperor and the pope: <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> was subdued by force or treachery, (50) and this final conquest extinguished the series of the exarchs, who had reigned with a subordinate power since the time of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and the ruin of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kingdom.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was summoned to acknowledge the victorious <PERSON>Lombard</PERSON> as her lawful sovereign; the annual tribute of a piece of gold was fixed as the ransom of each citizen, and the sword of destruction was unsheathed to exact the penalty of her disobedience.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> hesitated; they entreated; they complained; and the threatening <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were checked by arms and negotiations, till the popes had engaged the friendship of an ally and avenger beyond the <ORG>Alps.
</ORG> (51) Her deliverance by Pepin, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>754</CARDINAL> .
 In his distress, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> had implored the aid of the hero of the age, of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> Martel, who governed the <NORP>French</NORP> monarchy with the humble title of mayor or duke; and who, by his signal victory over the Saracens, had saved his country, and perhaps Europe, from the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> yoke.
 The ambassadors of the pope were received by <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> with decent reverence; but the greatness of his occupations, and the shortness of his life, prevented his interference in the affairs of Italy, except by a friendly and ineffectual mediation.
 His son Pepin, the heir of his power and virtues, assumed the office of champion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church; and the zeal of the <NORP>French</NORP> prince appears to have been prompted by the love of glory and religion.
 But the danger was on the banks of the Tyber, the succour on those of the Seine, and our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant misery.
 Amidst the tears of the city, <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> embraced the generous resolution of visiting in person the courts of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> and France, to deprecate the injustice of his enemy, or to excite the pity and indignation of his friend.
 After soothing the public despair by litanies and orations, he undertook this laborious journey with the ambassadors of the <NORP>French</NORP> monarch and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 The king of the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> was inexorable; but his threats could not silence the complaints, nor retard the speed of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, who traversed the Pennine Alps, reposed in the abbey of St.
 Maurice, and hastened to grasp the right hand of his protector; a hand which was never lifted in vain, either in war or friendship.
 <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> was entertained as the visible successor of the apostle; at the next assembly, the field of March or of May, his injuries were exposed to a devout and warlike nation, and he repassed the Alps, not as a suppliant, but as a conqueror, at the head of a <NORP>French</NORP> army, which was led by the king in person.
 The Lombards, after a weak resistance, obtained an ignominious peace, and swore to restore the possessions, and to respect the sanctity, of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church.
 But no sooner was <PERSON>Astolphus</PERSON> delivered from the presence of the <NORP>French</NORP> arms, than he forgot his promise and resented his disgrace.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was again encompassed by his arms; and Stephen, apprehensive of fatiguing the zeal of his <NORP>Transalpine</NORP> allies enforced his complaint and request by an eloquent letter in the name and person of St.
 Peter himself.
 (52) The apostle assures his adopted sons, the king, the clergy, and the nobles of France, that, dead in the flesh, he is still alive in the spirit; that they now hear, and must obey, the voice of the founder and guardian of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church; that the Virgin, the angels, the saints, and the martyrs, and all the host of heaven, unanimously urge the request, and will confess the obligation; that riches, victory, and paradise, will crown their pious enterprise, and that eternal damnation will be the penalty of their neglect, if they suffer his tomb, his temple, and his people, to fall into the hands of the perfidious Lombards.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> expedition of <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> was not less rapid and fortunate than the first: St.
 Peter was satisfied, <GPE>Rome</GPE> was again saved, and <PERSON>Astolphus</PERSON> was taught the lessons of justice and sincerity by the scourge of a foreign master.
 After this double chastisement, the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> languished about twenty years in a state of languor and decay.
 But their minds were not yet humbled to their condition; and instead of affecting the pacific virtues of the feeble, they peevishly harassed the <NORP>Romans</NORP> with a repetition of claims, evasions, and inroads, which they undertook without reflection, and terminated without glory.
 On either side, their expiring monarchy was pressed by the zeal and prudence of <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> the First, the genius, the fortune, and greatness of Charlemagne, the son of Pepin; these heroes of the church and state were united in public and domestic friendship, and while they trampled on the prostrate, they varnished their proceedings with the fairest colours of equity and moderation.

the former were surprised, the latter were invested, by the son of Pepin; and after a blockade of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years, Desiderius, the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> of their native princes, surrendered his sceptre and his capital.
 Under the dominion of a foreign king, but in the possession of their national laws, the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> became the brethren, rather than the subjects, of the Franks; who derived their blood, and manners, and language, from the same <NORP>Germanic</NORP> origin.
 (54) <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> and Charlemagne, Kings of France, A.
D.
 751.
 753.
 768.
 The mutual obligations of the popes and the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> family form the important link of ancient and modern, of civil and ecclesiastical, history.
 In the conquest of Italy, the champions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church obtained a favourable occasion, a specious title, the wishes of the people, the prayers and intrigues of the clergy.
 But the most essential gifts of the popes to the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> race were the dignities of king of France, (55) and of patrician of Rome.
 I.
 Under the sacerdotal monarchy of St.
 Peter, the nations began to resume the practice of seeking, on the banks of the Tyber, their kings, their laws, and the oracles of their fate.
 The <NORP>Franks</NORP> were perplexed between the name and substance of their government.
 All the powers of royalty were exercised by Pepin, mayor of the palace; and nothing, except the regal title, was wanting to his ambition.
 His enemies were crushed by his valour; his friends were multiplied by his liberality; his father had been the saviour of Christendom; and the claims of personal merit were repeated and ennobled in a descent of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> generations.
 The name and image of royalty was still preserved in the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> descendant of Clovis, the feeble Childeric; but his obsolete right could only be used as an instrument of sedition: the nation was desirous of restoring the simplicity of the constitution; and Pepin, a subject and a prince, was ambitious to ascertain his own rank and the fortune of his family.
 The mayor and the nobles were bound, by an oath of fidelity, to the royal phantom: the blood of <PERSON>Clovis</PERSON> was pure and sacred in their eyes; and their common ambassadors addressed the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, to dispel their scruples, or to absolve their promise.
 The interest of <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> Zachary, the successor of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Gregories, prompted him to decide, and to decide in their favour: he pronounced that the nation might lawfully unite in the same person the title and authority of king; and that the unfortunate Childeric, a victim of the public safety, should be degraded, shaved, and confined in a monastery for the remainder of his days.
 An answer so agreeable to their wishes was accepted by the <NORP>Franks</NORP> as the opinion of a casuist, the sentence of a judge, or the oracle of a prophet: the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> race disappeared from the earth; and <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> was exalted on a buckler by the suffrage of a free people, accustomed to obey his laws and to march under his standard.
 His coronation was twice performed, with the sanction of the popes, by their most faithful servant St.
 Boniface, the apostle of Germany, and by the grateful hands of <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> the Third, who, in the monastery of St.
 Denys placed the diadem on the head of his benefactor.
 The royal unction of the kings of <GPE>Israel</GPE> was dexterously applied: (56) the successor of St.
 Peter assumed the character of a divine ambassador: a <NORP>German</NORP> chieftain was transformed into the Lord's anointed; and this <NORP>Jewish</NORP> rite has been diffused and maintained by the superstition and vanity of modern Europe.
 The <NORP>Franks</NORP> were absolved from their ancient oath; but a dire anathema was thundered against them and their posterity, if they should dare to renew the same freedom of choice, or to elect a king, except in the holy and meritorious race of the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> princes.
 Without apprehending the future danger, these princes gloried in their present security: the secretary of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> affirms, that the <NORP>French</NORP> sceptre was transferred by the authority of the popes; (57) and in their boldest enterprises, they insist, with confidence, on this signal and successful act of temporal jurisdiction.
 Patricians of Rome.
 II.
 In the change of manners and language the patricians of <GPE>Rome</GPE> (58) were far removed from the senate of Romulus, on the palace of Constantine, from the free nobles of the republic, or the fictitious parents of the emperor.
 After the recovery of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> by the arms of Justinian, the importance and danger of those remote provinces required the presence of a supreme magistrate; he was indifferently styled the exarch or the patrician; and these governors of Ravenna, who fill their place in the chronology of princes, extended their jurisdiction over the <NORP>Roman</NORP> city.
 Since the revolt of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the loss of the Exarchate, the distress of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had exacted some sacrifice of their independence.
 Yet, even in this act, they exercised the right of disposing of themselves; and the decrees of the senate and people successively invested <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> Martel and his posterity with the honours of patrician of Rome.
 The leaders of a powerful nation would have disdained a servile title and subordinate office; but the reign of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors was suspended; and, in the vacancy of the empire, they derived a more glorious commission from the pope and the republic.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> ambassadors presented these patricians with the keys of the shrine of St.
 Peter, as a pledge and symbol of sovereignty; with a holy banner which it was their right and duty to unfurl in the defence of the church and city.
 (59) In the time of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> Martel and of Pepin, the interposition of the <PERSON>Lombard</PERSON> kingdom covered the freedom, while it threatened the safety, of Rome; and the patriciate represented only the title, the service, the alliance, of these distant protectors.
 The power and policy of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> annihilated an enemy, and imposed a master.
 In his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> visit to the capital, he was received with all the honours which had formerly been paid to the exarch, the representative of the emperor; and these honours obtained some new decorations from the joy and gratitude of <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> the First.
 (60) No sooner was he informed of the sudden approach of the monarch, than he despatched the magistrates and nobles of <GPE>Rome</GPE> to meet him, with the banner, about thirty miles from the city.
 At the distance of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> mile, the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way was lined with the schools, or national communities, of Greeks, Lombards, Saxons, etc.
: the <NORP>Roman</NORP> youth were under arms; and the children of a more tender age, with palms and olive branches in their hands, chanted the praises of their great deliverer.
 At the aspect of the holy crosses, and ensigns of the saints, he dismounted from his horse, led the procession of his nobles to the Vatican, and, as he ascended the stairs, devoutly kissed each step of the threshold of the apostles.
 In the portico, <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> expected him at the head of his clergy: they embraced, as friends and equals; but in their march to the altar, the king or patrician assumed the right hand of the pope.
 Nor was the <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> content with these vain and empty demonstrations of respect.
 In the twenty-six years that elapsed between the conquest of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> and his <NORP>Imperial</NORP> coronation, Rome, which had been delivered by the sword, was subject, as his own, to the sceptre of Charlemagne.
 The people swore allegiance to his person and family: in his name money was coined, and justice was administered; and the election of the popes was examined and confirmed by his authority.
 Except an original and self-inherent claim of sovereignty, there was not any prerogative remaining, which the title of emperor could add to the patrician of Rome.
 (61) Donations of <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> to the popes .
 The gratitude of the <NORP>Carlovingians</NORP> was adequate to these obligations, and their names are consecrated, as the saviours and benefactors of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church.
 Her ancient patrimony of farms and houses was transformed by their bounty into the temporal dominion of cities and provinces; and the donation of the <WORK_OF_ART>Exarchate</WORK_OF_ART> was the first-fruits of the conquests of Pepin.
 (62) <PERSON>Astolphus</PERSON> with a sigh relinquished his prey; the keys and the hostages of the principal cities were delivered to the <NORP>French</NORP> ambassador; and, in his master's name, he presented them before the tomb of St.
 Peter.
 The ample measure of the <WORK_OF_ART>Exarchate</WORK_OF_ART> (63) might comprise all the provinces of <GPE>Italy</GPE> which had obeyed the emperor and his vicegerent; but its strict and proper limits were included in the territories of Ravenna, Bologna, and Ferrara: its inseparable dependency was the Pentapolis, which stretched along the <LOC>Adriatic</LOC> from <GPE>Rimini</GPE> to Ancona, and advanced into the midland- country as far as the ridges of the Apennine.
 In this transaction, the ambition and avarice of the popes have been severely condemned.
 Perhaps the humility of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> priest should have rejected an earthly kingdom, which it was not easy for him to govern without renouncing the virtues of his profession.
 Perhaps a faithful subject, or even a generous enemy, would have been less impatient to divide the spoils of the Barbarian; and if the emperor had intrusted <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> to solicit in his name the restitution of the Exarchate, I will not absolve the pope from the reproach of treachery and falsehood.
 But in the rigid interpretation of the laws, every <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> may accept, without injury, whatever his benefactor can bestow without injustice.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor had abdicated, or forfeited, his right to the Exarchate; and the sword of <PERSON>Astolphus</PERSON> was broken by the stronger sword of the Carlovingian.
 It was not in the cause of the <NORP>Iconoclast</NORP> that <PERSON>Pepin</PERSON> has exposed his person and army in a double expedition beyond the Alps: he possessed, and might lawfully alienate, his conquests: and to the importunities of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> he piously replied that no human consideration should tempt him to resume the gift which he had conferred on the <NORP>Roman</NORP> Pontiff for the remission of his sins, and the salvation of his soul.
 The splendid donation was granted in supreme and absolute dominion, and the world beheld for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time a <NORP>Christian</NORP> bishop invested with the prerogatives of a temporal prince; the choice of magistrates, the exercise of justice, the imposition of taxes, and the wealth of the palace of Ravenna.
 In the dissolution of the <PERSON>Lombard</PERSON> kingdom, the inhabitants of the duchy of <GPE>Spoleto</GPE> (64) sought a refuge from the storm, shaved their heads after the <NORP>Roman</NORP> fashion, declared themselves the servants and subjects of St.
 Peter, and completed, by this voluntary surrender, the present circle of the ecclesiastical state.
 That mysterious circle was enlarged to an indefinite extent, by the verbal or written donation of Charlemagne, (65) who, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> transports of his victory, despoiled himself and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor of the cities and islands which had formerly been annexed to the Exarchate.
 But, in the cooler moments of absence and reflection, he viewed, with an eye of jealousy and envy, the recent greatness of his ecclesiastical ally.
 The execution of his own and his father's promises was respectfully eluded: the king of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> asserted the inalienable rights of the empire; and, in his life and death, Ravenna, (66) as well as Rome, was numbered in the list of his metropolitan cities.
 The sovereignty of the <WORK_OF_ART>Exarchate</WORK_OF_ART> melted away in the hands of the popes; they found in the archbishops of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> a dangerous and domestic rival: (67) the nobles and people disdained the yoke of a priest; and in the disorders of the times, they could only retain the memory of an ancient claim, which, in a more prosperous age, they have revived and realized.
 Forgery of the donation of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> .
 Fraud is the resource of weakness and cunning; and the strong, though ignorant, <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> was often entangled in the net of sacerdotal policy.
 The <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and <NORP>Lateran</NORP> were an arsenal and manufacture, which, according to the occasion, have produced or concealed a various collection of false or genuine, of corrupt or suspicious, acts, as they tended to promote the interest of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church.
 Before the end of the eighth century, some apostolic scribe, perhaps the notorious Isidore, composed the decretals, and the donation of Constantine, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> magic pillars of the spiritual and temporal monarchy of the popes.
 This memorable donation was introduced to the world by an epistle of <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> the First, who exhorts <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> to imitate the liberality, and revive the name, of the great Constantine.
 (68) According to the legend, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> emperors was healed of the leprosy, and purified in the waters of baptism, by St.
 Silvester, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> bishop; and never was physician more gloriously recompensed.
 His royal proselyte withdrew from the seat and patrimony of St.
 Peter; declared his resolution of founding a new capital in the East; and resigned to the popes the free and perpetual sovereignty of Rome, Italy, and the provinces of the West.
 (69) This fiction was productive of the most beneficial effects.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes were convicted of the guilt of usurpation; and the revolt of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> was the claim of his lawful inheritance.
 The popes were delivered from their debt of gratitude; and the nominal gifts of the <NORP>Carlovingians</NORP> were no more than the just and irrevocable restitution of a scanty portion of the ecclesiastical state.
 The sovereignty of <GPE>Rome</GPE> no longer depended on the choice of a fickle people; and the successors of St.
 Peter and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were invested with the purple and prerogatives of the Caesars.
 So deep was the ignorance and credulity of the times, that the most absurd of fables was received, with equal reverence, in <GPE>Greece</GPE> and in France, and is still enrolled among the decrees of the canon law.
 (70) The emperors, and the Romans, were incapable of discerning a forgery, that subverted their rights and freedom; and the only opposition proceeded from a <NORP>Sabine</NORP> monastery, which, in the beginning of the twelfth century, disputed the truth and validity of the donation of Constantine.
 (71) In the revival of letters and liberty, this fictitious deed was transpierced by the pen of Laurentius Valla, the pen of an eloquent critic and a <NORP>Roman</NORP> patriot.
 (72) His contemporaries of the fifteenth century were astonished at his sacrilegious boldness; yet such is the silent and irresistible progress of reason, that, before the end of the next age, the fable was rejected by the contempt of historians (73) and poets, (74) and the tacit or modest censure of the advocates of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church.
 (75) The popes themselves have indulged a smile at the credulity of the vulgar; (76) but a false and obsolete title still sanctifies their reign; and, by the same fortune which has attended the decretals and the <NORP>Sibylline</NORP> oracles, the edifice has subsisted after the foundations have been undermined.
 Restoration of images in the <LOC>East</LOC> by the empress Irene, A.
D.
 780, etc .
 While the popes established in <GPE>Italy</GPE> their freedom and dominion, the images, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> cause of their revolt, were restored in the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 (77) Under the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the Fifth, the union of civil and ecclesiastical power had overthrown the tree, without extirpating the root, of superstition.
 The idols (for such they were now held) were secretly cherished by the order and the sex most prone to devotion; and the fond alliance of the monks and females obtained a final victory over the reason and authority of man.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fourth</ORDINAL> maintained with less rigour the religion of his father and grandfather; but his wife, the fair and ambitious Irene, had imbibed the zeal of the Athenians, the heirs of the Idolatry, rather than the philosophy, of their ancestors.
 During the life of her husband, these sentiments were inflamed by danger and dissimulation, and she could only labor to protect and promote some favourite monks whom she drew from their caverns, and seated on the metropolitan thrones of the East.
 But as soon as she reigned in her own name and that of her son, <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> more seriously undertook the ruin of the Iconoclasts; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> step of her future persecution was a general edict for liberty of conscience.
 In the restoration of the monks, a thousand images were exposed to the public veneration; a thousand legends were inverted of their sufferings and miracles.
 By the opportunities of death or removal, the episcopal seats were judiciously filled the most eager competitors for earthly or celestial favour anticipated and flattered the judgment of their sovereign; and the promotion of her secretary <PERSON>Tarasius</PERSON> gave <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> the patriarch of Constantinople, and the command of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> church.
 But the decrees of a general council could only be repealed by a similar assembly: (78) the <NORP>Iconoclasts</NORP> whom she convened were bold in possession, and averse to debate; and the feeble voice of the bishops was reechoed by the more formidable clamour of the soldiers and people of Constantinople.
 VIIth general council, <ORG>IInd</ORG> of Nice, A.
D.
 787, Sept.
 24-Oct.
 <CARDINAL>23</CARDINAL> .
The delay and intrigues of a year, the separation of the disaffected troops, and the choice of <GPE>Nice</GPE> for a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> orthodox synod, removed these obstacles; and the episcopal conscience was again, after the <NORP>Greek</NORP> fashion, in the hands of the prince.
 No more than eighteen days were allowed for the consummation of this important work: the <NORP>Iconoclasts</NORP> appeared, not as judges, but as criminals or penitents: the scene was decorated by the legates of <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> and the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> patriarchs, (79) the decrees were framed by the president Taracius, and ratified by the acclamations and subscriptions of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> bishops.
 They unanimously pronounced, that the worship of images is agreeable to <WORK_OF_ART>Scripture</WORK_OF_ART> and reason, to the fathers and councils of the church: but they hesitate whether that worship be relative or direct; whether the Godhead, and the figure of Christ, be entitled to the same mode of adoration.
 Of this <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Nicene</PERSON> council the acts are still extant; a curious monument of superstition and ignorance, of falsehood and folly.
 I shall only notice the judgment of the bishops on the comparative merit of image-worship and morality.
 A monk had concluded a truce with the daemon of fornication, on condition of interrupting his <DATE>daily</DATE> prayers to a picture that hung in his cell.
 His scruples prompted him to consult the abbot.
 Final establishment of images by the empress Theodora, A.
D.
 842 For the honour of orthodoxy, at least the orthodoxy of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church, it is somewhat unfortunate, that the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes who convened the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> councils of <GPE>Nice</GPE> are both stained with the blood of their sons.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> of these assemblies was approved and rigorously executed by the despotism of Irene, and she refused her adversaries the toleration which at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> she had granted to her friends.
 During the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> succeeding reigns, a period of thirty-eight years, the contest was maintained, with unabated rage and various success, between the worshippers and the breakers of the images; but I am not inclined to pursue with minute diligence the repetition of the same events.
 <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> allowed a general liberty of speech and practice; and the only virtue of his reign is accused by the monks as the cause of his temporal and eternal perdition.
 Superstition and weakness formed the character of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the First, but the saints and images were incapable of supporting their votary on the throne.
 In the purple, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> asserted the name and religion of an Armenian; and the idols, with their seditious adherents, were condemned to a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> exile.
 Their applause would have sanctified the murder of an impious tyrant, but his assassin and successor, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Michael, was tainted from his birth with the <NORP>Phrygian</NORP> heresies: he attempted to mediate between the contending parties; and the intractable spirit of the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> insensibly cast him into the opposite scale.
 His moderation was guarded by timidity; but his son Theophilus, alike ignorant of fear and pity, was the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> and most cruel of the Iconoclasts.
 The enthusiasm of the times ran strongly against them; and the emperors who stemmed the torrent were exasperated and punished by the public hatred.
 After the death of Theophilus, the final victory of the images was achieved by a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> female, his widow Theodora, whom he left the guardian of the empire.
 Her measures were bold and decisive.
 The fiction of a tardy repentance absolved the fame and the soul of her deceased husband; the sentence of the <NORP>Iconoclast</NORP> patriarch was commuted from the loss of his eyes to a whipping of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> lashes: the bishops trembled, the monks shouted, and the festival of orthodoxy preserves the annual memory of the triumph of the images.
 A single question yet remained, whether they are endowed with any proper and inherent sanctity; it was agitated by the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> of the eleventh century; (81) and as this opinion has the strongest recommendation of absurdity, I am surprised that it was not more explicitly decided in the affirmative.
 In the West, <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> accepted and announced the decrees of the <PERSON>Nicene</PERSON> assembly, which is now revered by the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> as the <ORDINAL>seventh</ORDINAL> in rank of the general councils.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> were docile to the voice of their father; but the greatest part of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> <NORP>Christians</NORP> were far behind in the race of superstition.
 Reluctance of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and Charlemagne, A.
D.
 794, etc .
 The churches of France, Germany, England, and Spain, steered a middle course between the adoration and the destruction of images, which they admitted into their temples, not as objects of worship, but as lively and useful memorials of faith and history.
 An angry book of controversy was composed and published in the name of Charlemagne: (82) under his authority a synod of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> bishops was assembled at Frankfort: (83) they blamed the fury of the Iconoclasts, but they pronounced a more severe censure against the superstition of the Greeks, and the decrees of their pretended council, which was long despised by the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of the West.
 (84) Among them the worship of images advanced with a silent and insensible progress; but a large atonement is made for their hesitation and delay, by the gross idolatry of the ages which precede the reformation, and of the countries, both in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and America, which are still immersed in the gloom of superstition.
 Final separation of the popes from the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 774-800.
 It was after the <PERSON>Nycene</PERSON> synod, and under the reign of the pious Irene, that the popes consummated the separation of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Italy, by the translation of the empire to the less orthodox Charlemagne.
 They were compelled to choose between the rival nations: religion was not the sole motive of their choice; and while they dissembled the failings of their friends, they beheld, with reluctance and suspicion, the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> virtues of their foes.
 The difference of language and manners had perpetuated the enmity of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> capitals; and they were alienated from each other by the hostile opposition of seventy years.
 In that schism the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had tasted of freedom, and the popes of sovereignty: their submission would have exposed them to the revenge of a jealous tyrant; and the revolution of <GPE>Italy</GPE> had betrayed the impotence, as well as the tyranny, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors had restored the images, but they had not restored the <NORP>Calabrian</NORP> estates (85) and the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> diocese, (86) which the <NORP>Iconociasts</NORP> had torn away from the successors of St.
 Peter; and <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> threatens them with a sentence of excommunication unless they speedily abjure this practical heresy.
 (87) The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were now orthodox; but their religion might be tainted by the breath of the reigning monarch: the <NORP>Franks</NORP> were now contumacious; but a discerning eye might discern their approaching conversion, from the use, to the adoration, of images.
 The name of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> was stained by the polemic acrimony of his scribes; but the conqueror himself conformed, with the temper of a statesman, to the various practice of <GPE>France</GPE> and Italy.
 In his <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> pilgrimages or visits to the Vatican, he embraced the popes in the communion of friendship and piety; knelt before the tomb, and consequently before the image, of the apostle; and joined, without scruple, in all the prayers and processions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> liturgy.
 Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor? Had they a right to alienate his gift of the Exarchate? Had they power to abolish his government of Rome? The title of patrician was below the merit and greatness of Charlemagne; and it was only by reviving the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire that they could pay their obligations or secure their establishment.
 By this decisive measure they would finally eradicate the claims of the Greeks; from the debasement of a provincial town, the majesty of <GPE>Rome</GPE> would be restored: the <NORP>Latin</NORP> <NORP>Christians</NORP> would be united, under a supreme head, in their ancient metropolis; and the conquerors of the <LOC>West</LOC> would receive their crown from the successors of St.
 Peter.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> church would acquire a zealous and respectable advocate; and, under the shadow of the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> power, the bishop might exercise, with honour and safety, the government of the city.
 (88) Coronation of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> as emperor of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of the West, A.
D.
 800, Dec.
 <CARDINAL>25</CARDINAL> .
 Before the ruin of <NORP>Paganism</NORP> in Rome, the competition for a wealthy bishopric had often been productive of tumult and bloodshed.
 The people was less numerous, but the times were more savage, the prize more important, and the chair of St.
 Peter was fiercely disputed by the leading ecclesiastics who aspired to the rank of sovereign.
 The reign of <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> (89) surpasses the measure of past or succeeding ages; (90) the walls of Rome, the sacred patrimony, the ruin of the Lombards, and the friendship of Charlemagne, were the trophies of his fame: he secretly edified the throne of his successors, and displayed in a narrow space the virtues of a great prince.
 His memory was revered; but in the next election, a priest of the Lateran, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Third, was preferred to the nephew and the favourite of Adrian, whom he had promoted to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> dignities of the church.
 Their acquiescence or repentance disguised, above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, the blackest intention of revenge, till the day of a procession, when a furious band of conspirators dispersed the unarmed multitude, and assaulted with blows and wounds the sacred person of the pope.
 But their enterprise on his life or liberty was disappointed, perhaps by their own confusion and remorse.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> was left for dead on the ground: on his revival from the swoon, the effect of his loss of blood, he recovered his speech and sight; and this natural event was improved to the miraculous restoration of his eyes and tongue, of which he had been deprived, twice deprived, by the knife of the assassins.
 (91) From his prison he escaped to the Vatican: the duke of <GPE>Spoleto</GPE> hastened to his rescue, <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> sympathized in his injury, and in his camp of <GPE>Paderborn</GPE> in <GPE>Westphalia</GPE> accepted, or solicited, a visit from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> repassed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> with a commission of counts and bishops, the guards of his safety and the judges of his innocence; and it was not without reluctance, that the conqueror of the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> delayed till the ensuing year the personal discharge of this pious office.
 In his <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> pilgrimage, he was received at <GPE>Rome</GPE> with the due honours of king and patrician: <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> was permitted to purge himself by oath of the crimes imputed to his charge: his enemies were silenced, and the sacrilegious attempt against his life was punished by the mild and insufficient penalty of exile.
 On the festival of Christmas, the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> year of the eighth century, <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> appeared in the church of St.
 Peter; and, to gratify the vanity of Rome, he had exchanged the simple dress of his country for the habit of a patrician.
 (92) After the celebration of the holy mysteries, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> suddenly placed a precious crown on his head, (93) and the dome resounded with the acclamations of the people, The head and body of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> were consecrated by the royal unction: after the example of the Caesars, he was saluted or adored by the pontiff: his coronation oath represents a promise to maintain the faith and privileges of the church; and the first-fruits were paid in his rich offerings to the shrine of his apostle.
 In his familiar conversation, the emperor protested the ignorance of the intentions of Leo, which he would have disappointed by his absence on that memorable day.
 But the preparations of the ceremony must have disclosed the secret; and the journey of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> reveals his knowledge and expectation: he had acknowledged that the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> title was the object of his ambition, and a <NORP>Roman</NORP> synod had pronounced, that it was the only adequate reward of his merit and services.
 (94) Reign and character of Charlemagne, A.
D.
 768-814 .
 The appellation of great has been often bestowed, and sometimes deserved; but CHARLEMAGNE is the only prince in whose favour the title has been indissolubly blended with the name.
 That name, with the addition of saint, is inserted in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> calendar; and the saint, by a rare felicity, is crowned with the praises of the historians and philosophers of an enlightened age.
 (95) His real merit is doubtless enhanced by the barbarism of the nation and the times from which he emerged: but the apparent magnitude of an object is likewise enlarged by an unequal comparison; and the ruins of <LOC>Palmyra</LOC> derive a casual splendour from the nakedness of the surrounding desert.
 Without injustice to his fame, I may discern some blemishes in the sanctity and greatness of the restorer of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 Of his moral virtues, chastity is not the most conspicuous: (96) but the public happiness could not be materially injured by his <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> wives or concubines, the various indulgence of meaner or more transient amours, the multitude of his bastards whom he bestowed on the church, and the long celibacy and licentious manners of his daughters, (97) whom the father was suspected of loving with too fond a passion.
 I shall be scarcely permitted to accuse the ambition of a conqueror; but in a day of equal retribution, the sons of his brother Carloman, the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> princes of Aquitain, and the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <NORP>Saxons</NORP> who were beheaded on the same spot, would have something to allege against the justice and humanity of Charlemagne.
 His treatment of the vanquished <NORP>Saxons</NORP> (98) was an abuse of the right of conquest; his laws were not less sanguinary than his arms, and in the discussion of his motives, whatever is subtracted from bigotry must be imputed to temper.
 The sedentary reader is amazed by his incessant activity of mind and body; and his subjects and enemies were not less astonished at his sudden presence, at the moment when they believed him at the most distant extremity of the empire; neither peace nor war, nor summer nor winter, were a season of repose; and our fancy cannot easily reconcile the annals of his reign with the geography of his expeditions.
 But this activity was a national, rather than a personal, virtue; the vagrant life of a <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> was spent in the chase, in pilgrimage, in military adventures; and the journeys of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> were distinguished only by a more numerous train and a more important purpose.
 His military renown must be tried by the scrutiny of his troops, his enemies, and his actions.
 <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> conquered with the arms of Philip, but the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> heroes who preceded <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> bequeathed him their name, their examples, and the companions of their victories.
 At the head of his veteran and superior armies, he oppressed the savage or degenerate nations, who were incapable of confederating for their common safety: nor did he ever encounter an equal antagonist in numbers, in discipline, or in arms The science of war has been lost and revived with the arts of peace; but his campaigns are not illustrated by any siege or battle of singular difficulty and success; and he might behold, with envy, the <NORP>Saracen</NORP> trophies of his grandfather.
 After the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> expedition, his rear-guard was defeated in the <NORP>Pyrenaean</NORP> mountains; and the soldiers, whose situation was irretrievable, and whose valour was useless, might accuse, with their <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> breath, the want of skill or caution of their general.
 (99) I touch with reverence the laws of Charlemagne, so highly applauded by a respectable judge.
 They compose not a system, but a series, of occasional and minute edicts, for the correction of abuses, the reformation of manners, the economy of his farms, the care of his poultry, and even the sale of his eggs.
 He wished to improve the laws and the character of the Franks; and his attempts, however feeble and imperfect, are deserving of praise: the inveterate evils of the times were suspended or mollified by his government; (100) but in his institutions I can seldom discover the general views and the immortal spirit of a legislator, who survives himself for the benefit of posterity.
 The union and stability of his empire depended on the life of a single man: he imitated the dangerous practice of dividing his kingdoms among his sons; and after his numerous diets, the whole constitution was left to fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and despotism.
 His esteem for the piety and knowledge of the clergy tempted him to intrust that aspiring order with temporal dominion and civil jurisdiction; and his son Lewis, when he was stripped and degraded by the bishops, might accuse, in some measure, the imprudence of his father.
 His laws enforced the imposition of tithes, because the daemons had proclaimed in the air that the default of payment had been the cause of the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> scarcity.
 (101) The literary merits of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> are attested by the foundation of schools, the introduction of arts, the works which were published in his name, and his familiar connection with the subjects and strangers whom he invited to his court to educate both the prince and people.
 His own studies were tardy, laborious, and imperfect; if he spoke Latin, and understood Greek, he derived the rudiments of knowledge from conversation, rather than from books; and, in his mature age, the emperor strove to acquire the practice of writing, which every peasant now learns in his infancy.
 (102) The grammar and logic, the music and astronomy, of the times, were only cultivated as the handmaids of superstition; but the curiosity of the human mind must ultimately tend to its improvement, and the encouragement of learning reflects the purest and most pleasing lustre on the character of Charlemagne.
 (103) The dignity of his person, (104) the length of his reign, the prosperity of his arms, the vigour of his government, and the reverence of distant nations, distinguish him from the royal crowd; and <LOC>Europe</LOC> dates a new aera from his restoration of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 Extent of his empire.
 That empire was not unworthy of its title; (105) and some of the fairest kingdoms of <LOC>Europe</LOC> were the patrimony or conquest of a prince, who reigned at the same time in France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Hungary.
 (106) France.
 I.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> province of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> had been transformed into the name and monarchy of France; but, in the decay of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> line, its limits were contracted by the independence of the <NORP>Britons</NORP> and the revolt of Aquitain.
 <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> pursued, and confined, the <NORP>Britons</NORP> on the shores of the ocean; and that ferocious tribe, whose origin and language are so different from the French, was chastised by the imposition of tribute, hostages, and peace.
 After a long and evasive contest, the rebellion of the dukes of <GPE>Aquitain</GPE> was punished by the forfeiture of their province, their liberty, and their lives.
 Harsh and rigorous would have been such treatment of ambitious governors, who had too faithfully copied the mayors of the palace.
 But a recent discovery (107) has proved that these unhappy princes were the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> and lawful heirs of the blood and sceptre of Clovis, and younger branch, from the brother of Dagobert, of the <NORP>Merovingian</NORP> house.
 Their ancient kingdom was reduced to the duchy of Gascogne, to the counties of <GPE>Fesenzac</GPE> and Armagnac, at the foot of the Pyrenees: their race was propagated till the beginning of the sixteenth century; and after surviving their <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> tyrants, they were reserved to feel the injustice, or the favours, of a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> dynasty.
 By the reunion of Aquitain, <GPE>France</GPE> was enlarged to its present boundaries, with the additions of the <GPE>Netherlands</GPE> and Spain, as far as the Rhine.
 <GPE>Spain</GPE> .
 II.
 The <NORP>Saracens</NORP> had been expelled from <GPE>France</GPE> by the grandfather and father of Charlemagne; but they still possessed the greatest part of SPAIN, from the rock of <GPE>Gibraltar</GPE> to the Pyrenees.
 Amidst their civil divisions, an <NORP>Arabian</NORP> emir of <PERSON>Saragossa</PERSON> implored his protection in the diet of Paderborn.
 <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> undertook the expedition, restored the emir, and, without distinction of faith, impartially crushed the resistance of the Christians, and rewarded the obedience and services of the Mahometans.
 In his absence he instituted the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> march, (108) which extended from the <LOC>Pyrenees</LOC> to the River Ebro: <GPE>Barcelona</GPE> was the residence of the <NORP>French</NORP> governor: he possessed the counties of <GPE>Rousillon</GPE> and Catalonia; and the infant kingdoms of <GPE>Navarre</GPE> and <GPE>Arragon</GPE> were subject to his jurisdiction.
 III.
 <GPE>Italy</GPE> .
As king of the Lombards, and patrician of Rome, he reigned over the greatest part of ITALY, (109) a tract of a thousand miles from the <LOC>Alps</LOC> to the borders of Calabria.
 The duchy of Beneventum, a <PERSON>Lombard</PERSON> fief, had spread, at the expense of the Greeks, over the modern kingdom of Naples.
 But Arrechis, the reigning duke, refused to be included in the slavery of his country; assumed the independent title of prince; and opposed his sword to the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> monarchy.
 His defence was firm, his submission was not inglorious, and the emperor was content with an easy tribute, the demolition of his fortresses, and the acknowledgement, on his coins, of a supreme lord.
 The artful flattery of his son <PERSON>Grimoald</PERSON> added the appellation of father, but he asserted his dignity with prudence, and <PERSON>Benventum</PERSON> insensibly escaped from the <NORP>French</NORP> yoke.
 (110) IV.
 <GPE>Germany</GPE> .
Charlemagne was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who united <GPE>GERMANY</GPE> under the same sceptre.
 The name of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> <GPE>France</GPE> is preserved in the circle of Franconia; and the people of <GPE>Hesse</GPE> and <GPE>Thuringia</GPE> were recently incorporated with the victors, by the conformity of religion and government.
 The Alemanni, so formidable to the Romans, were the faithful vassals and confederates of the Franks; and their country was inscribed within the modern limits of Alsace, Swabia, and Switzerland.
 The Bavarians, with a similar indulgence of their laws and manners, were less patient of a master: the repeated treasons of <PERSON>Tasillo</PERSON> justified the abolition of their hereditary dukes; and their power was shared among the counts, who judged and guarded that important frontier.
 But the north of Germany, from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and beyond the Elbe, was still hostile and Pagan; nor was it till after a war of thirty-three years that the <NORP>Saxons</NORP> bowed under the yoke of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and of Charlemagne.
 The idols and their votaries were extirpated: the foundation of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> bishoprics, of Munster, Osnaburgh, Paderborn, and Minden, of Bremen, Verden, Hildesheim, and Halberstadt, define, on either side of the Weser, the bounds of ancient <GPE>Saxony</GPE> these episcopal seats were the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> schools and cities of that savage land; and the religion and humanity of the children atoned, in some degree, for the massacre of the parents.
 Beyond the Elbe, the Slavi, or Sclavonians, of similar manners and various denominations, overspread the modern dominions of Prussia, Poland, and Bohemia, and some transient marks of obedience have tempted the <NORP>French</NORP> historian to extend the empire to the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> and the Vistula.
 The conquest or conversion of those countries is of a more recent age; but the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> union of <GPE>Bohemia</GPE> with the <NORP>Germanic</NORP> body may be justly ascribed to the arms of Charlemagne.
 V.
 <GPE>Hungary</GPE> .
 He retaliated on the Avars, or <NORP>Huns</NORP> of Pannonia, the same calamities which they had inflicted on the nations.
 Their rings, the wooden fortifications which encircled their districts and villages, were broken down by the triple effort of a <NORP>French</NORP> army, that was poured into their country by land and water, through the Carpathian mountains and along the plain of the Danube.
 After a bloody conflict of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> years, the loss of some <NORP>French</NORP> generals was avenged by the slaughter of the most noble Huns: the relics of the nation submitted the royal residence of the chagan was left desolate and unknown; and the treasures, the rapine of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years, enriched the victorious troops, or decorated the churches of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Gaul.
 (111) After the reduction of Pannonia, the empire of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> was bounded only by the conflux of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> with the <NORP>Teyss</NORP> and the Save: the provinces of Istria, Liburnia, and Dalmatia, were an easy, though unprofitable, accession; and it was an effect of his moderation, that he left the maritime cities under the real or nominal sovereignty of the Greeks.
 But these distant possessions added more to the reputation than to the power of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> emperor; nor did he risk any ecclesiastical foundations to reclaim the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> from their vagrant life and idolatrous worship.
 Some canals of communication between the rivers, the <LOC>Saone</LOC> and the Meuse, the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and the Danube, were faintly attempted.
 (112) Their execution would have vivified the empire; and more cost and labor were often wasted in the structure of a cathedral.
 His neighbours and enemies .
 If we retrace the outlines of this geographical picture, it will be seen that the empire of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> extended, between east and west, from the <LOC>Ebro</LOC> to the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> or Vistula; between the north and south, from the duchy of <GPE>Beneventum</GPE> to the River Eyder, the perpetual boundary of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Denmark.
 The personal and political importance of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> was magnified by the distress and division of the rest of Europe.
 The islands of Great Britain and <GPE>Ireland</GPE> were disputed by a crowd of princes of <NORP>Saxon</NORP> or <NORP>Scottish</NORP> origin: and, after the loss of Spain, the <NORP>Christian</NORP> and <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kingdom of <GPE>Alphonso</GPE> the <GPE>Chaste</GPE> was confined to the narrow range of the Asturian mountains.
 These petty sovereigns revered the power or virtue of the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> monarch, implored the honour and support of his alliance, and styled him their common parent, the sole and supreme emperor of the West.
 (113) He maintained a more equal intercourse with the caliph Harun al Rashid, (114) whose dominion stretched from <LOC>Africa</LOC> to India, and accepted from his ambassadors a tent, a water-clock, an elephant, and the keys of the Holy Sepulchre.
 It is not easy to conceive the private friendship of a <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> and an Arab, who were strangers to each other's person, and language, and religion: but their public correspondence was founded on vanity, and their remote situation left no room for a competition of interest.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> thirds of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were subject to Charlemagne, and the deficiency was amply supplied by his command of the inaccessible or invincible nations of Germany.
 But in the choice of his enemies, we may be reasonably surprised that he so often preferred the poverty of the north to the riches of the south.
 The <CARDINAL>three-and-thirty</CARDINAL> campaigns laboriously consumed in the woods and morasses of <GPE>Germany</GPE> would have sufficed to assert the amplitude of his title by the expulsion of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> from <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> from Spain.
 The weakness of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> would have insured an easy victory; and the holy crusade against the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> would have been prompted by glory and revenge, and loudly justified by religion and policy.
 Perhaps, in his expeditions beyond the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and the Elbe, he aspired to save his monarchy from the fate of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, to disarm the enemies of civilized society, and to eradicate the seed of future emigrations.
 But it has been wisely observed, that, in a light of precaution, all conquest must be ineffectual, unless it could be universal, since the increasing circle must be involved in a larger sphere of hostility.
 (115) The subjugation of <GPE>Germany</GPE> withdrew the veil which had so long concealed the continent or islands of <LOC>Scandinavia</LOC> from the knowledge of Europe, and awakened the torpid courage of their barbarous natives.
 The fiercest of the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> idolaters escaped from the <NORP>Christian</NORP> tyrant to their brethren of the North; the <LOC>Ocean</LOC> and <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> were covered with their piratical fleets; and <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> beheld with a sigh the destructive progress of the Normans, who, in less than seventy years, precipitated the fall of his race and monarchy.
 His successors.
 A.
D.
 814-887 in Italy; <CARDINAL>911</CARDINAL> in Germany; <CARDINAL>987</CARDINAL> in <GPE>France</GPE> .
 Had the pope and the <NORP>Romans</NORP> revived the primitive constitution, the titles of emperor and <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> were conferred on <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> for the term of his life; and his successors, on each vacancy, must have ascended the throne by a formal or tacit election.
 But the association of his son <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> the <PERSON>Pious</PERSON> asserts the independent right of monarchy and conquest, and the emperor seems on this occasion to have foreseen and prevented the latent claims of the clergy.
 A.
D.
 813.
 The royal youth was commanded to take the crown from the altar, and with his own hands to place it on his head, as a gift which he held from God, his father, and the nation.
 (116) The same ceremony was repeated, though with less energy, in the subsequent associations of <GPE>Lothaire</GPE> and <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> the Second: the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> sceptre was transmitted from father to son in a lineal descent of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> generations; and the ambition of the popes was reduced to the empty honour of crowning and anointing these hereditary princes, who were already invested with their power and dominions.
 <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> the Pious, A.
D.
 814-840 .
The pious <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> survived his brothers, and embraced the whole empire of Charlemagne; but the nations and the nobles, his bishops and his children, quickly discerned that this mighty mass was no longer inspired by the same soul; and the foundations were undermined to the centre, while the external surface was yet fair and entire.
 After a war, or battle, which consumed <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> thousand Franks, the empire was divided by treaty between his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons, who had violated every filial and fraternal duty.
 <GPE>Lothaire</GPE> I A.
D.
 840-856 .
 The kingdoms of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and <GPE>France</GPE> were forever separated; the provinces of Gaul, between the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> and the Alps, the <FAC>Meuse</FAC> and the Rhine, were assigned, with Italy, to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity of Lothaire.
 In the partition of his share, <PERSON>Lorraine</PERSON> and Arles, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> recent and transitory kingdoms, were bestowed on the younger children; <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> II.
 A.
D.
 856-875 and <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> the Second, his eldest son, was content with the realm of Italy, the proper and sufficient patrimony of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 On his death without any male issue, the vacant throne was disputed by his uncles and cousins, and the popes most dexterously seized the occasion of judging the claims and merits of the candidates, and of bestowing on the most obsequious, or most liberal, the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> office of advocate of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church.
 The dregs of the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> race no longer exhibited any symptoms of virtue or power, and the ridiculous epithets of the bald, the stammerer, the fat, and the simple, distinguished the tame and uniform features of a crowd of kings alike deserving of oblivion.
 Division of the empire, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>888</CARDINAL> .
 By the failure of the collateral branches, the whole inheritance devolved to <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the Fat, the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> emperor of his family: his insanity authorized the desertion of Germany, Italy, and France: he was deposed in a diet, and solicited his <DATE>daily</DATE> bread from the rebels by whose contempt his life and liberty had been spared.
 According to the measure of their force, the governors, the bishops, and the lords, usurped the fragments of the falling empire; and some preference was shown to the female or illegitimate blood of Charlemagne.
 Of the greater part, the title and possession were alike doubtful, and the merit was adequate to the contracted scale of their dominions.
 Those who could appear with an army at the gates of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were crowned emperors in the Vatican; but their modesty was more frequently satisfied with the appellation of kings of Italy: and the whole term of seventy-four years may be deemed a vacancy, from the abdication of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the Fat to the establishment of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the First.
 <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> king of <GPE>Germany</GPE> restores and appropriates the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>962</CARDINAL> .
 <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> (117) was of the noble race of the dukes of Saxony; and if he truly descended from Witikind, the adversary and proselyte of Charlemagne, the posterity of a vanquished people was exalted to reign over their conquerors.
 His father, <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Fowler, was elected, by the suffrage of the nation, to save and institute the kingdom of Germany.
 Its limits (118) were enlarged on every side by his son, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and greatest of the Othos.
 A portion of Gaul, to the west of the Rhine, along the banks of the <FAC>Meuse</FAC> and the Moselle, was assigned to the Germans, by whose blood and language it has been tinged since the time of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Tacitus.
 Between the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Alps, the successors of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> acquired a vain supremacy over the broken kingdoms of <PERSON>Burgundy</PERSON> and Arles.
 In the North, <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was propagated by the sword of Otho, the conqueror and apostle of the <NORP>Slavic</NORP> nations of the <LOC>Elbe</LOC> and Oder: the marches of <GPE>Brandenburgh</GPE> and <LOC>Sleswick</LOC> were fortified with <NORP>German</NORP> colonies; and the king of Denmark, the dukes of <GPE>Poland</GPE> and Bohemia, confessed themselves his tributary vassals.
 At the head of a victorious army, he passed the Alps, subdued the kingdom of Italy, delivered the pope, and forever fixed the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crown in the name and nation of Germany.
 From that memorable aera, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> maxims of public jurisprudence were introduced by force and ratified by time.
 I.
 That the prince, who was elected in the <NORP>German</NORP> diet, acquired, from that instant, the subject kingdoms of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome.
 II.
 But that he might not legally assume the titles of emperor and Augustus, till he had received the crown from the hands of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff.
 (119) Transactions of the <NORP>Western</NORP> and <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empires .
 The <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> was announced to the <LOC>East</LOC> by the alteration of his style; and instead of saluting his fathers, the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors, he presumed to adopt the more equal and familiar appellation of brother.
 (120) Perhaps in his connection with <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> he aspired to the name of husband: his embassy to <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> spoke the language of peace and friendship, and might conceal a treaty of marriage with that ambitious princess, who had renounced the most sacred duties of a mother.
 The nature, the duration, the probable consequences of such a union between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> distant and dissonant empires, it is impossible to conjecture; but the unanimous silence of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> may teach us to suspect, that the report was invented by the enemies of Irene, to charge her with the guilt of betraying the church and state to the strangers of the West.
 (121) The <NORP>French</NORP> ambassadors were the spectators, and had nearly been the victims, of the conspiracy of Nicephorus, and the national hatred.
 <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was exasperated by the treason and sacrilege of ancient Rome: a proverb, "That the <NORP>Franks</NORP> were good friends and bad neighbours," was in every one's mouth; but it was dangerous to provoke a neighbour who might be tempted to reiterate, in the church of St.
 Sophia, the ceremony of his <NORP>Imperial</NORP> coronation.
 After a tedious journey of circuit and delay, the ambassadors of <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> found him in his camp, on the banks of the River Sala; and <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> affected to confound their vanity by displaying, in a <NORP>Franconian</NORP> village, the pomp, or at least the pride, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace.
 (122) The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were successively led through <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> halls of audience: in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> they were ready to fall prostrate before a splendid personage in a chair of state, till he informed them that he was only a servant, the constable, or master of the horse, of the emperor.
 The same mistake, and the same answer, were repeated in the apartments of the count palatine, the steward, and the chamberlain; and their impatience was gradually heightened, till the doors of the presence-chamber were thrown open, and they beheld the genuine monarch, on his throne, enriched with the foreign luxury which he despised, and encircled with the love and reverence of his victorious chiefs.
 A treaty of peace and alliance was concluded between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> empires, and the limits of the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> were defined by the right of present possession.
 But the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> (123) soon forgot this humiliating equality, or remembered it only to hate the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> by whom it was extorted.
 During the short union of virtue and power, they respectfully saluted the august Charlemagne, with the acclamations of basileus, and emperor of the Romans.
 As soon as these qualities were separated in the person of his pious son, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> letters were inscribed, When both power and virtue were extinct, they despoiled <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> of his hereditary title, and with the barbarous appellation of rex or rega, degraded him among the crowd of <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes.
 His reply (124) is expressive of his weakness: he proves, with some learning, that, both in sacred and profane history, the name of king is synonymous with the <NORP>Greek</NORP> word basileus: if, at Constantinople, it were assumed in a more exclusive and imperial sense, he claims from his ancestors, and from the popes, a just participation of the honours of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> purple.
 The same controversy was revived in the reign of the Othos; and their ambassador describes, in lively colours, the insolence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court.
 (125) The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> affected to despise the poverty and ignorance of the <NORP>Franks</NORP> and Saxons; and in their <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> decline refused to prostitute to the kings of <GPE>Germany</GPE> the title of <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors.
 Authority of the emperors in the elections of the popes, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>800-1060</CARDINAL> .
 These emperors, in the election of the popes, continued to exercise the powers which had been assumed by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> and <NORP>Grecian</NORP> princes; and the importance of this prerogative increased with the temporal estate and spiritual jurisdiction of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church.
 In the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aristocracy, the principal members of the clergy still formed a senate to assist the administration, and to supply the vacancy, of the bishop.
 <GPE>Rome</GPE> was divided into <CARDINAL>twenty-eight</CARDINAL> parishes, and each parish was governed by a cardinal priest, or presbyter, a title which, however common or modest in its origin, has aspired to emulate the purple of kings.
 Their number was enlarged by the association of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> deacons of the most considerable hospitals, the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> palatine judges of the Lateran, and some dignitaries of the church.
 This ecclesiastical senate was directed by the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> cardinal-bishops of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> province, who were less occupied in the suburb dioceses of Ostia, Porto, Velitrae, Tusculum, Praeneste, Tibur, and the Sabines, than by their <DATE>weekly</DATE> service in the Lateran, and their superior share in the honours and authority of the apostolic see.
 On the death of the pope, these bishops recommended a successor to the suffrage of the college of cardinals, (126) and their choice was ratified or rejected by the applause or clamour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 But the election was imperfect; nor could the pontiff be legally consecrated till the emperor, the advocate of the church, had graciously signified his approbation and consent.
 The royal commissioner examined, on the spot, the form and freedom of the proceedings; nor was it till after a previous scrutiny into the qualifications of the candidates, that he accepted an oath of fidelity, and confirmed the donations which had successively enriched the patrimony of St.
 Peter.
 In the frequent schisms, the rival claims were submitted to the sentence of the emperor; and in a synod of bishops he presumed to judge, to condemn, and to punish, the crimes of a guilty pontiff.
 <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> imposed a treaty on the senate and people, who engaged to prefer the candidate most acceptable to his majesty: (127) his successors anticipated or prevented their choice: they bestowed the <NORP>Roman</NORP> benefice, like the bishoprics of <GPE>Cologne</GPE> or Bamberg, on their chancellors or preceptors; and whatever might be the merit of a <PERSON>Frank</PERSON> or Saxon, his name sufficiently attests the interposition of foreign power.
 These acts of prerogative were most speciously excused by the vices of a popular election.
 The competitor who had been excluded by the cardinals appealed to the passions or avarice of the multitude; the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> were stained with blood; and the most powerful senators, the marquises of <GPE>Tuscany</GPE> and the counts of Tusculum, held the apostolic see in a long and disgraceful servitude.
 Disorders .
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiffs, of the ninth and tenth centuries, were insulted, imprisoned, and murdered, by their tyrants; and such was their indigence, after the loss and usurpation of the ecclesiastical patrimonies, that they could neither support the state of a prince, nor exercise the charity of a priest.
 (128) The influence of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sister prostitutes, <PERSON>Marozia</PERSON> and Theodora, was founded on their wealth and beauty, their political and amorous intrigues: the most strenuous of their lovers were rewarded with the <NORP>Roman</NORP> mitre, and their reign (129) may have suggested to the darker ages (130) the fable (131) of a female pope.
 (132) The bastard son, the grandson, and the great-grandson of Marozia, a rare genealogy, were seated in the chair of St.
 Peter, and it was at the age of nineteen years that the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> of these became the head of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church.
 His youth and manhood were of a suitable complexion; and the nations of pilgrims could bear testimony to the charges that were urged against him in a <NORP>Roman</NORP> synod, and in the presence of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the Great.
 As John XII.
 had renounced the dress and decencies of his profession, the soldier may not perhaps be dishonoured by the wine which he drank, the blood that he spilt, the flames that he kindled, or the licentious pursuits of gaming and hunting.
 His open simony might be the consequence of distress; and his blasphemous invocation of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> and Venus, if it be true, could not possibly be serious.
 But we read, with some surprise, that the worthy grandson of <PERSON>Marozia</PERSON> lived in public adultery with the matrons of Rome; that the <NORP>Lateran</NORP> palace was turned into a school for prostitution, and that his rapes of virgins and widows had deterred the female pilgrims from visiting the tomb of St.
 Peter, lest, in the devout act, they should be violated by his successor.
 (133) The <NORP>Protestants</NORP> have dwelt with malicious pleasure on these characters of Antichrist; but to a philosophic eye, the vices of the clergy are far less dangerous than their virtues.
 Reformation and claims of the church, A.
D.
 1073, etc.
 After a long series of scandal, the apostolic see was reformed and exalted by the austerity and zeal of <PERSON>Gregory</PERSON> VII.
 That ambitious monk devoted his life to the execution of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> projects.
 I.
 To fix in the college of cardinals the freedom and independence of election, and forever to abolish the right or usurpation of the emperors and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 II.
 To bestow and resume the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire as a fief or benefice (134) of the church, and to extend his temporal dominion over the kings and kingdoms of the earth.
 After a contest of <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> years, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these designs was accomplished by the firm support of the ecclesiastical order, whose liberty was connected with that of their chief.
 But the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> attempt, though it was crowned with some partial and apparent success, has been vigorously resisted by the secular power, and finally extinguished by the improvement of human reason.
 Authority of the emperors in <GPE>Rome</GPE> .
 In the revival of the empire of empire of Rome, neither the bishop nor the people could bestow on <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> or <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the provinces which were lost, as they had been won, by the chance of arms.
 But the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were free to choose a master for themselves; and the powers which had been delegated to the patrician, were irrevocably granted to the <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Saxon</NORP> emperors of the West.
 The broken records of the times (135) preserve some remembrance of their palace, their mint, their tribunal, their edicts, and the sword of justice, which, as late as the thirteenth century, was derived from <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> to the praefect of the city.
 (136) Between the arts of the popes and the violence of the people, this supremacy was crushed and annihilated.
 Content with the titles of emperor and Augustus, the successors of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> neglected to assert this local jurisdiction.
 In the hour of prosperity, their ambition was diverted by more alluring objects; and in the decay and division of the empire, they were oppressed by the defence of their hereditary provinces.
 Revolt of Alberic, A.
D.
 932 Amidst the ruins of Italy, the famous <PERSON>Marozia</PERSON> invited <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the usurpers to assume the character of her <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> husband; and Hugh, king of <PERSON>Burgundy</PERSON> was introduced by her faction into the mole of <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> or <PERSON>Castle</PERSON> of St.
 Angelo, which commands the principal bridge and entrance of Rome.
 Her son by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> marriage, Alberic, was compelled to attend at the nuptial banquet; but his reluctant and ungraceful service was chastised with a blow by his new father.
 The blow was productive of a revolution.
 The alarum bell rang to arms in every quarter of the city: the <NORP>Burgundians</NORP> retreated with haste and shame; <PERSON>Marozia</PERSON> was imprisoned by her victorious son, and his brother, <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> John XI.
, was reduced to the exercise of his spiritual functions.
 With the title of prince, <PERSON>Alberic</PERSON> possessed above twenty years the government of Rome; and he is said to have gratified the popular prejudice, by restoring the office, or at least the title, of consuls and tribunes.
 His son and heir <PERSON>Octavian</PERSON> assumed, with the pontificate, the name of John XII.
: like his predecessor, he was provoked by the <PERSON>Lombard</PERSON> princes to seek a deliverer for the church and republic; and the services of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> were rewarded with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity.
 But the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> was imperious, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were impatient, the festival of the coronation was disturbed by the secret conflict of prerogative and freedom, and <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> commanded his sword-bearer not to stir from his person, lest he should be assaulted and murdered at the foot of the altar.
 (138)of pope John XII.
 A.
D.
 967.
 Before he repassed the Alps, the emperor chastised the revolt of the people and the ingratitude of John XII.
 The pope was degraded in a synod; the praefect was mounted on an ass, whipped through the city, and cast into a dungeon; <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> of the most guilty were hanged, others were mutilated or banished; and this severe process was justified by the ancient laws of <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> and Justinian.
 The voice of fame has accused the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> of a perfidious and bloody act, the massacre of the senators, whom he had invited to his table under the fair semblance of hospitality and friendship.
 (139) Of the consul Crescentius.
 A.
D.
 998.
 In the minority of his son <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the Third, <GPE>Rome</GPE> made a bold attempt to shake off the <NORP>Saxon</NORP> yoke, and the consul <PERSON>Crescentius</PERSON> was the <PERSON>Brutus</PERSON> of the republic.
 From the condition of a subject and an exile, he twice rose to the command of the city, oppressed, expelled, and created the popes, and formed a conspiracy for restoring the authority of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors.
 In the fortress of St.
 Angelo, he maintained an obstinate siege, till the unfortunate consul was betrayed by a promise of safety: his body was suspended on a gibbet, and his head was exposed on the battlements of the castle.
 By a reverse of fortune, Otho, after separating his troops, was besieged <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days, without food, in his palace; and a disgraceful escape saved him from the justice or fury of the Romans.
 The senator <PERSON>Ptolemy</PERSON> was the leader of the people, and the widow of <PERSON>Crescentius</PERSON> enjoyed the pleasure or the fame of revenging her husband, by a poison which she administered to her <NORP>Imperial</NORP> lover.
 It was the design of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> to abandon the ruder countries of the North, to erect his throne in Italy, and to revive the institutions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarchy.
 But his successors only once in their lives appeared on the banks of the Tyber, to receive their crown in the Vatican.
 (140) Their absence was contemptible, their presence odious and formidable.
 They descended from the Alps, at the head of their barbarians, who were strangers and enemies to the country; and their transient visit was a scene of tumult and bloodshed.
 (141) A faint remembrance of their ancestors still tormented the Romans; and they beheld with pious indignation the succession of Saxons, Franks, Swabians, and Bohemians, who usurped the purple and prerogatives of the Caesars.
 The kingdom of Italy, A.
D.
 774-1250 .
 There is nothing perhaps more adverse to nature and reason than to hold in obedience remote countries and foreign nations, in opposition to their inclination and interest.
 A torrent of <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> may pass over the earth, but an extensive empire must be supported by a refined system of policy and oppression; in the centre, an absolute power, prompt in action and rich in resources; a swift and easy communication with the extreme parts; fortifications to check the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> effort of rebellion; a regular administration to protect and punish; and a well-disciplined army to inspire fear, without provoking discontent and despair.
 Far different was the situation of the <NORP>German</NORP> Caesars, who were ambitious to enslave the kingdom of Italy.
 Their patrimonial estates were stretched along the Rhine, or scattered in the provinces; but this ample domain was alienated by the imprudence or distress of successive princes; and their revenue, from minute and vexatious prerogative, was scarcely sufficient for the maintenance of their household.
 Their troops were formed by the legal or voluntary service of their feudal vassals, who passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> with reluctance, assumed the license of rapine and disorder, and capriciously deserted before the end of the campaign.
 Whole armies were swept away by the pestilential influence of the climate: the survivors brought back the bones of their princes and nobles, (142) and the effects of their own intemperance were often imputed to the treachery and malice of the Italians, who rejoiced at least in the calamities of the Barbarians.
 This irregular tyranny might contend on equal terms with the petty tyrants of Italy; nor can the people, or the reader, be much interested in the event of the quarrel.
 But in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> rekindled the flame of industry and freedom; and the generous example was at length imitated by the republics of Tuscany.
 In the <NORP>Italian</NORP> cities a municipal government had never been totally abolished; and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> privileges were granted by the favour and policy of the emperors, who were desirous of erecting a plebeian barrier against the independence of the nobles.
 But their rapid progress, the <DATE>daily</DATE> extension of their power and pretensions, were founded on the numbers and spirit of these rising communities.
 (143) Each city filled the measure of her diocese or district: the jurisdiction of the counts and bishops, of the marquises and counts, was banished from the land; and the proudest nobles were persuaded or compelled to desert their solitary castles, and to embrace the more honourable character of freemen and magistrates.
 The legislative authority was inherent in the general assembly; but the executive powers were intrusted to <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> consuls, annually chosen from the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> orders of captains, valvassors, (144) and commons, into which the republic was divided.
 Under the protection of equal law, the labours of agriculture and commerce were gradually revived; but the martial spirit of the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> was nourished by the presence of danger; and as often as the bell was rung, or the standard (145) erected, the gates of the city poured forth a numerous and intrepid band, whose zeal in their own cause was soon guided by the use and discipline of arms.
 At the foot of these popular ramparts, the pride of the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> was overthrown; and the invincible genius of liberty prevailed over the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Frederics, the greatest princes of the middle age; the first, superior perhaps in military prowess; the second, who undoubtedly excelled in the softer accomplishments of peace and learning.
 <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the first, A.
D.
 1152-1190.
 Ambitious of restoring the splendour of the purple, <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> invaded the republics of Lombardy, with the arts of a statesman, the valour of a soldier, and the cruelty of a tyrant.
 The recent discovery of the <PERSON>Pandects</PERSON> had renewed a science most favourable to despotism; and his venal advocates proclaimed the emperor the absolute master of the lives and properties of his subjects.
 His royal prerogatives, in a less odious sense, were acknowledged in the diet of Roncaglia; and the revenue of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was fixed at thirty thousand pounds of silver, (146) which were multiplied to an indefinite demand by the rapine of the fiscal officers.
 The obstinate cities were reduced by the terror or the force of his arms: his captives were delivered to the executioner, or shot from his military engines; and.
 after the siege and surrender of Milan, the buildings of that stately capital were razed to the ground, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> hostages were sent into Germany, and the inhabitants were dispersed in <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> villages, under the yoke of the inflexible conqueror.
 (147) But <GPE>Milan</GPE> soon rose from her ashes; and the league of <GPE>Lombardy</GPE> was cemented by distress: their cause was espoused by Venice, <PERSON>Pope</PERSON> <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> the Third, and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor: the fabric of oppression was overturned in a day; and in the treaty of Constance, <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> subscribed, with some reservations, the freedom of <CARDINAL>four-and-twenty</CARDINAL> cities.
 His grandson contended with their vigour and maturity; but <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> II.
, A.
D.
 1198-1250.
 <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> (148) was endowed with some personal and peculiar advantages.
 His birth and education recommended him to the Italians; and in the implacable discord of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions, the <NORP>Ghibelins</NORP> were attached to the emperor, while the <PERSON>Guelfs</PERSON> displayed the banner of liberty and the church.
 The court of <GPE>Rome</GPE> had slumbered, when his father <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Sixth was permitted to unite with the empire the kingdoms of <GPE>Naples</GPE> and Sicily; and from these hereditary realms the son derived an ample and ready supply of troops and treasure.
 Yet <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> was finally oppressed by the arms of the <PERSON>Lombards</PERSON> and the thunders of the Vatican: his kingdom was given to a stranger, and the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> of his family was beheaded at <GPE>Naples</GPE> on a public scaffold.
 During sixty years, no emperor appeared in Italy, and the name was remembered only by the ignominious sale of the <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> relics of sovereignty.
 Independence of the princes of Germany, A.
D.
 814-1250,etc .
 The <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> conquerors of the <LOC>West</LOC> were pleased to decorate their chief with the title of emperor; but it was not their design to invest him with the despotism of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Justinian.
 The persons of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> were free, their conquests were their own, and their national character was animated by a spirit which scorned the servile jurisprudence of the new or the ancient Rome.
 It would have been a vain and dangerous attempt to impose a monarch on the armed freemen, who were impatient of a magistrate; on the bold, who refused to obey; on the powerful, who aspired to command.
 The empire of <PERSON>Charlemagne</PERSON> and <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> was distributed among the dukes of the nations or provinces, the counts of the smaller districts, and the margraves of the marches or frontiers, who all united the civil and military authority as it had been delegated to the lieutenants of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Caesars.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> governors, who, for the most part, were soldiers of fortune, seduced their mercenary legions, assumed the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, and either failed or succeeded in their revolt, without wounding the power and unity of government.
 If the dukes, margraves, and counts of Germany, were less audacious in their claims, the consequences of their success were more lasting and pernicious to the state.
 Instead of aiming at the supreme rank, they silently labored to establish and appropriate their provincial independence.
 Their ambition was seconded by the weight of their estates and vassals, their mutual example and support, the common interest of the subordinate nobility, the change of princes and families, the minorities of <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> and <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Fourth, the ambition of the popes, and the vain pursuit of the fugitive crowns of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Rome.
 All the attributes of regal and territorial jurisdiction were gradually usurped by the commanders of the provinces; the right of peace and war, of life and death, of coinage and taxation, of foreign alliance and domestic economy.
 Whatever had been seized by violence, was ratified by favour or distress, was granted as the price of a doubtful vote or a voluntary service; whatever had been granted to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> could not, without injury, be denied to his successor or equal; and every act of local or temporary possession was insensibly moulded into the constitution of the <NORP>Germanic</NORP> kingdom.
 In every province, the visible presence of the duke or count was interposed between the throne and the nobles; the subjects of the law became the vassals of a private chief; and the standard which he received from his sovereign, was often raised against him in the field.
 The temporal power of the clergy was cherished and exalted by the superstition or policy of the <NORP>Carlovingian</NORP> and <NORP>Saxon</NORP> dynasties, who blindly depended on their moderation and fidelity; and the bishoprics of <GPE>Germany</GPE> were made equal in extent and privilege, superior in wealth and population, to the most ample states of the military order.
 As long as the emperors retained the prerogative of bestowing on every vacancy these ecclesiastic and secular benefices, their cause was maintained by the gratitude or ambition of their friends and favourites.
 But in the quarrel of the investitures, they were deprived of their influence over the episcopal chapters; the freedom of election was restored, and the sovereign was reduced, by a solemn mockery, to his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> prayers, the recommendation, once in his reign, to a single prebend in each church.
 The secular governors, instead of being recalled at the will of a superior, could be degraded only by the sentence of their peers.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age of the monarchy, the appointment of the son to the duchy or county of his father, was solicited as a favour; it was gradually obtained as a custom, and extorted as a right: the lineal succession was often extended to the collateral or female branches; the states of the empire (their popular, and at length their legal, appellation) were divided and alienated by testament and sale; and all idea of a public trust was lost in that of a private and perpetual inheritance.
 The emperor could not even be enriched by the casualties of forfeiture and extinction: within the term of a year, he was obliged to dispose of the vacant fief; and, in the choice of the candidate, it was his duty to consult either the general or the provincial diet.
 The <NORP>Germanic</NORP> constitution, A.
D.
 1250.
 After the death of <PERSON>Frederic</PERSON> the Second, <GPE>Germany</GPE> was left a monster with a <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> heads.
 A crowd of princes and prelates disputed the ruins of the empire: the lords of innumerable castles were less prone to obey, than to imitate, their superiors; and, according to the measure of their strength, their incessant hostilities received the names of conquest or robbery.
 Such anarchy was the inevitable consequence of the laws and manners of Europe; and the kingdoms of <GPE>France</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> were shivered into fragments by the violence of the same tempest.
 But the <NORP>Italian</NORP> cities and the <NORP>French</NORP> vassals were divided and destroyed, while the union of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> has produced, under the name of an empire, a great system of a federative republic.
 In the frequent and at <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> the perpetual institution of diets, a national spirit was kept alive, and the powers of a common legislature are still exercised by the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> branches or colleges of the electors, the princes, and the free and <NORP>Imperial</NORP> cities of Germany.
 I.
 <CARDINAL>Seven</CARDINAL> of the most powerful feudatories were permitted to assume, with a distinguished name and rank, the exclusive privilege of choosing the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor; and these electors were the king of Bohemia, the duke of Saxony, the margrave of Brandenburgh, the count palatine of the Rhine, and the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> archbishops of Mentz, of Treves, and of Cologne.
 II.
 The college of princes and prelates purged themselves of a promiscuous multitude: they reduced to <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> representative votes the long series of independent counts, and excluded the nobles or equestrian order, sixty thousand of whom, as in the <NORP>Polish</NORP> diets, had appeared on horseback in the field of election.
 III.
 The pride of birth and dominion, of the sword and the mitre, wisely adopted the commons as the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> branch of the legislature, and, in the progress of society, they were introduced about the same aera into the national assemblies of <GPE>France</GPE> England, and Germany.
 The Hanseatic League commanded the trade and navigation of the north: the confederates of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> secured the peace and intercourse of the inland country; the influence of the cities has been adequate to their wealth and policy, and their negative still invalidates the acts of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> superior colleges of electors and princes.
 (149) Weakness and poverty of the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> IV.
 A.
D.
 1347-1378 .
 It is in the fourteenth century that we may view in the strongest light the state and contrast of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire of Germany, which no longer held, except on the borders of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> and Danube, a single province of <GPE>Trajan</GPE> or Constantine.
 Their unworthy successors were the counts of Hapsburgh, of Nassau, of Luxemburgh, and Schwartzenburgh: the emperor <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the Seventh procured for his son the crown of Bohemia, and his grandson <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fourth</ORDINAL> was born among a people strange and barbarous in the estimation of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> themselves.
 (150) After the excommunication of <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> of Bavaria, he received the gift or promise of the vacant empire from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiffs, who, in the exile and captivity of Avignon, affected the dominion of the earth.
 The death of his competitors united the electoral college, and <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> was unanimously saluted king of the Romans, and future emperor; a title which, in the same age, was prostituted to the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Greece.
 The <NORP>German</NORP> emperor was no more than the elective and impotent magistrate of an aristocracy of princes, who had not left him a village that he might call his own.
 His best prerogative was the right of presiding and proposing in the national senate, which was convened at his summons; and his native kingdom of Bohemia, less opulent than the adjacent city of Nuremberg, was the firmest seat of his power and the richest source of his revenue.
 A.
D.
 1355 The army with which he passed the <LOC>Alps</LOC> consisted of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> horse.
 In the cathedral of St.
 Ambrose, <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> was crowned with the iron crown, which tradition ascribed to the <PERSON>Lombard</PERSON> monarchy; but he was admitted only with a peaceful train; the gates of the city were shut upon him; and the king of <GPE>Italy</GPE> was held a captive by the arms of the Visconti, whom he confirmed in the sovereignty of Milan.
 In the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> he was again crowned with the golden crown of the empire; but, in obedience to a secret treaty, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor immediately withdrew, without reposing a single night within the walls of Rome.
 The eloquent Petrarch, (151) whose fancy revived the visionary glories of the Capitol, deplores and upbraids the ignominious flight of the Bohemian; and even his contemporaries could observe, that the sole exercise of his authority was in the lucrative sale of privileges and titles.
 The gold of <GPE>Italy</GPE> secured the election of his son; but such was the shameful poverty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor, that his person was arrested by a butcher in the streets of Worms, and was detained in the public inn, as a pledge or hostage for the payment of his expenses.
 His ostentation, A.
D.
 1356 .
 From this humiliating scene, let us turn to the apparent majesty of the same <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> in the diets of the empire.
 The golden bull, which fixes the <NORP>Germanic</NORP> constitution, is promulgated in the style of a sovereign and legislator.
 A <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> princes bowed before his throne, and exalted their own dignity by the voluntary honours which they yielded to their chief or minister.
 At the royal banquet, the hereditary great officers, the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> electors, who in rank and title were equal to kings, performed their solemn and domestic service of the palace.
 The seals of the triple kingdom were borne in state by the archbishops of Mentz, Cologne, and Treves, the perpetual arch-chancellors of Germany, Italy, and Arles.
 The great marshal, on horseback, exercised his function with a silver measure of oats, which he emptied on the ground, and immediately dismounted to regulate the order of the guests The great steward, the count palatine of the Rhine, place the dishes on the table.
 The great chamberlain, the margrave of Brandenburgh, presented, after the repast, the golden ewer and basin, to wash.
 The king of Bohemia, as great cup-bearer, was represented by the emperor's brother, the duke of <NORP>Luxemburgh</NORP> and Brabant; and the procession was closed by the great huntsmen, who introduced a boar and a stag, with a loud chorus of horns and hounds.
 (152) Nor was the supremacy of the emperor confined to <GPE>Germany</GPE> alone: the hereditary monarchs of <LOC>Europe</LOC> confessed the preeminence of his rank and dignity: he was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> princes, the temporal head of the great republic of the West: (153) to his person the title of majesty was long appropriated; and he disputed with the pope the sublime prerogative of creating kings and assembling councils.
 The oracle of the civil law, the learned Bartolus, was a pensioner of <PERSON>Charles</PERSON> the Fourth; and his school resounded with the doctrine, that the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor was the rightful sovereign of the earth, from the rising to the setting sun.
 The contrary opinion was condemned, not as an error, but as a heresy, since even the gospel had pronounced, Contrast of the power and modesty of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> .
 If we annihilate the interval of time and space between <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Charles, strong and striking will be the contrast between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Caesars; the <NORP>Bohemian</NORP> who concealed his weakness under the mask of ostentation, and the Roman, who disguised his strength under the semblance of modesty.
 At the head of his victorious legions, in his reign over the sea and land, from the <LOC>Nile</LOC> and <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> to the Atlantic Ocean, <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> professed himself the servant of the state and the equal of his fellow-citizens.
 The conqueror of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and her provinces assumed a popular and legal form of a censor, a consul, and a tribune.
 His will was the law of mankind, but in the declaration of his laws he borrowed the voice of the senate and people; and from their decrees their master accepted and renewed his temporary commission to administer the republic.
 In his dress, his domestics, (155) his titles, in all the offices of social life, <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> maintained the character of a private Roman; and his most artful flatterers respected the secret of his absolute and perpetual monarchy.
