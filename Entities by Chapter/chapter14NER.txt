Period of civil wars and confusion A.
D.
 305-323 THE balance of power established by <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> subsisted no longer than while it was sustained by the firm and dexterous hand of the founder.
 It required such a fortunate mixture of different tempers and abilities as could scarcely be found, or even expected, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors without jealousy, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <ORG>Caesars</ORG> without ambition and the same general interest invariably pursued by <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> independent princes.
 The abdication of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> was succeeded by eighteen <DATE>years</DATE> of discord and confusion.
 The empire was afflicted by <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> civil wars; and the remainder of the time was not so much a state of tranquillity as a suspension of arms between several hostile monarchs, who, viewing each other with an eye of fear and hatred, strove to increase their respective forces at the expense of their subjects.
 Character and situation of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> As soon as <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> had resigned the purple, their station, according to the rules of the new constitution, was filled by the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Caesars, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> and Galerius, who immediately assumed the title of Augustus.
 (1) The honours of seniority and precedence were allowed to the former of those princes, and he continued under a new appellation to administer his ancient department of Gaul, Spain, and Britain.
 The government of those ample provinces was sufficient to exercise his talents and to satisfy his ambition.
 Clemency, temperance, and moderation distinguished the amiable character of Constantius, and his fortunate subjects had frequently occasion to compare the virtues of their sovereign with the passions of Maximian, and even with the arts of Diocletian.
 (2) Instead of imitating their eastern pride and magnificence, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> preserved the modesty of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> prince.
 He declared, with unaffected sincerity, that his most valued treasure was in the hearts of his people; and that, whenever the dignity of the throne or the danger of the state required any extraordinary supply, he could depend with confidence on their gratitude and liberality.
 (3) The provincials of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, sensible of his worth, and of their own happiness, reflected with anxiety on the declining health of the emperor Constantius, and the tender age of his numerous family, the issue of his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> marriage with the daughter of Maximian.
 Of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> The stern temper of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> was cast in a very different mould; and while he commanded the esteem of his subjects, he seldom condescended to solicit their affections.
 His fame in arms, and, above all, the success of the Persian war, had elated his haughty mind, which was naturally impatient of a superior, or even of an equal.
 If it were possible to rely on the partial testimony of an injudicious writer, we might ascribe the abdication of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> to the menaces of Galerius, and relate the particulars of a private conversation between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes, in which the former discovered as much pusillanimity as the latter displayed ingratitude and arrogance.
 (4) But these obscure anecdotes are sufficiently refuted by an impartial view of the character and conduct of Diocletian.
 Whatever might otherwise have been his intentions, if he had apprehended any danger from the violence of Galerius, his good sense would have instructed him to prevent the ignominious contest; and as he had held the sceptre with glory, he would have resigned it without disgrace.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> Caesars, <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> After the elevation of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> to the rank of Augusti, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> new <ORG>Caesars</ORG> were required to supply their place, and to complete the system of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> government.
 <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> was sincerely desirous of withdrawing himself from the world; he considered Galerius, who had married his daughter, as the firmest support of his family and of the empire; and he consented, without reluctance, that his successor should assume the merit as well as the envy of the important nomination.
 It was fixed without consulting the interest or inclination of the princes of the West.
 Each of them had a son who was arrived at the age of manhood, and who might have been deemed the most natural candidates for the vacant honour.
 But the impotent resentment of <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> was no longer to be dreaded; and the moderate Constantius, though he might despise the dangers, was humanely apprehensive of the calamities, of civil war.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> persons whom <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> promoted to the rank of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> were much better suited to serve the views of his ambition; and their principal recommendation seems to have consisted in the want of merit or personal consequence.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these was Daza, or, as he was afterwards called, Maximin, whose mother was the sister of Galerius.
 The inexperienced youth still betrayed by his manners and language his rustic education, when, to his own astonishment, as well as that of the world, he was invested by <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> with the purple, exalted to the dignity of Caesar, and intrusted with the sovereign command of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Syria.
 (5) At the same time Severus, a faithful servant, addicted to pleasure but not incapable of business, was sent to <GPE>Milan</GPE> to receive from the reluctant hands of <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> the <NORP>Caesarian</NORP> ornaments and the possession of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Africa.
 (6) According to the forms of the constitution, <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> acknowledged the supremacy of the western emperor; but he was absolutely devoted to the commands of his benefactor Galerius, who, reserving to himself the intermediate countries from the confines of <GPE>Italy</GPE> to those of Syria, firmly established his power over three-fourths of the monarchy.
 In the full confidence that the approaching death of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> would leave him sole master of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world we are assured that he had arranged in his mind a long succession of future princes, and that he meditated his own retreat from public life after he should have accomplished a glorious reign of about twenty years.
 (7) Ambition of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> disappointed by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> revolutions But, within less than eighteen months, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> unexpected revolutions overturned the ambitious schemes of Galerius.
 The hopes of uniting the western provinces to his empire were disappointed by the elevation of Constantine; whilst <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> were lost by the successful revolt of Maxentius.
 Birth, education and escape of Constantine.
 A.
D.
 274 I.
 The fame of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> has rendered posterity attentive to the most minute circumstances of his life and actions.
 The place of his birth, as well as the condition of his mother Helena, have been the subject not only of literary but of national disputes.
 Notwithstanding the recent tradition which assigns for her father a <NORP>British</NORP> king, (8) we are obliged to confess that <PERSON>Helena</PERSON> was the daughter of an innkeeper; but at the same time we may defend the legality of her marriage against those who have represented her as the concubine of Constantius.
 (9) The great <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was most probably born at Naissus, in Dacia; (10) and it is not surprising that, in a family and province distinguished only by the profession of arms, the youth should discover very little inclination to improve his mind by the acquisition of knowledge.
 (11) He was about eighteen <DATE>years</DATE> of age when his father was promoted to the rank of Caesar; but that fortunate event was attended with his mother's divorce; and the splendour of an <NORP>Imperial</NORP> alliance reduced the son of <PERSON>Helena</PERSON> to a state of disgrace and humiliation.
 Instead of following <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in the West, he remained in the service of Diocletian, signalising his valour in the wars of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Persia, and gradually rose to the honourable station of a tribune of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> order.
 The figure of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was tall and majestic; he was dexterous in all his exercises, intrepid in war, affable in peace; in his whole conduct the active spirit of youth was tempered by habitual prudence; and while his mind was engrossed by ambition, he appeared cold and insensible to the allurements of pleasure.
 The favour of the people and soldiers, who had named him as a worthy candidate for the rank of Caesar, served only to exasperate the jealousy of Galerius; and though prudence might restrain him from exercising any open violence, an absolute monarch is seldom at a loss how to execute a sure and secret revenge.
 (12) Every hour increased the danger of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and the anxiety of his father, who, by repeated letters, expressed the warmest desire of embracing his son.
 For some time the policy of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> supplied him with delays and excuses, but it was impossible long to refuse so natural a request of his associate without maintaining his refusal by arms.
 The permission of the journey was reluctantly granted, and, whatever precautions the emperor might have taken to intercept a return, the consequences of which he with so much reason apprehended, they were effectually disappointed by the incredible diligence of Constantine.
 (13) Leaving the palace of <GPE>Nicomedia</GPE> in the night, he travelled post through Bithynia, Thrace, Dacia, Pannonia, Italy, and, amidst the joyful acclamations of the people, reached the port of <GPE>Boulogne</GPE> in the very moment when his father was preparing to embark for Britain.
 (14) Death of Constantius, and elevation of Constantine.
A.
D.
 306 July 25.
 The <NORP>British</NORP> expedition, and an easy victory over the barbarians of Caledonia, were the last exploits of the reign of Constantius.
 He ended his life in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> palace of York, fifteen months after he had received the title of Augustus, and almost fourteen <DATE>years</DATE> and a <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> after he had been promoted to the rank of Caesar.
 His death was immediately succeeded by the elevation of Constantine.
 The ideas of inheritance and succession are so very familiar that the generality of mankind consider them as founded not only in reason but in nature itself.
 Our imagination readily transfers the same principles from private property to public dominion: and whenever a virtuous father leaves behind him a son whose merit seems to justify the esteem, or even the hopes, of the people, the joint influence of prejudice and of affection operates with irresistible weight.
 The flower of the western armies had followed <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> into Britain, and the national troops were reinforced by a numerous body of Alemanni, who obeyed the orders of Crocus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their hereditary chieftains.
 (15) The opinion of their own importance, and the assurance that Britain, Gaul, and <GPE>Spain</GPE> would acquiesce in their nomination, were diligently inculcated to the legions by the adherents of Constantine.
 The soldiers were asked whether they could hesitate a moment between the honour of placing at their head the worthy son of their beloved emperor and the ignominy of tamely expecting the arrival of some obscure stranger, on whom it might please the sovereign of <LOC>Asia</LOC> to bestow the armies and provinces of the West? It was insinuated to them that gratitude and liberality held a distinguished place among the virtues of Constantine; nor did that artful prince show himself to the troops till they were prepared to salute him with the names of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Emperor.
 The throne was the object of his desires; and had he been less actuated by ambition, it was his only means of safety.
 He was well acquainted with the character and sentiments of Galerius, and sufficiently apprised that, if he wished to live, he must determine to reign.
 The decent, and even obstinate, resistance which he chose to affect (16) was contrived to justify his usurpation; nor did he yield to the acclamations of the army till he had provided the proper materials for a letter, which he immediately despatched to the emperor of the East.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> informed him of the melancholy event of his father's death, modestly asserted his natural claim to the succession, and respectfully lamented that the affectionate violence of his troops had not permitted him to solicit the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple in the regular and constitutional manner.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emotions of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> were those of surprise, disappointment, and rage; and, as he could seldom restrain his passions, he loudly threatened that he would commit to the flames both the letter and the messenger.
 He is acknowledged by Galerius, who gives him only the title of Caesar, and that of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> to <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> But his resentment insensibly subsided; and when he recollected the doubtful chance of war, when he had weighed the character and strength of his adversary, he consented to embrace the honourable accommodation which the prudence of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had left open to him.
 Without either condemning or ratifying the choice of the <NORP>British</NORP> army, <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> accepted the son of his deceased colleague as the sovereign of the provinces beyond the Alps; but he gave him only the title of Caesar, and the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> rank among the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes, whilst he conferred the vacant place of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> on his favourite Severus.
 The apparent harmony of the empire was still preserved, and Constantine, who already possessed the substance, expected, without impatience, an opportunity of obtaining the honours of supreme power.
 (17) The brothers and sisters of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> The children of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> by his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> marriage were <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> in number, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> of either sex, and whose <NORP>Imperial</NORP> descent might have solicited a preference over the meaner extraction of the son of Helena.
 But <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was in the thirty-second year of his age, in the full vigour both of mind and body, at the time when the eldest of his brothers could not possibly be more than thirteen <DATE>years</DATE> old.
 His claim of superior merit had been allowed and ratified by the dying emperor.
 (18) In his last moments <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> bequeathed to his eldest son the care of the safety, as well as greatness, of the family; conjuring him to assume both the authority and the sentiments of a father with regard to the children of Theodora.
 Their liberal education, advantageous marriages, the secure dignity of their lives, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> honours of the state with which they were invested, attest the fraternal affection of Constantine; and, as those princes possessed a mild and grateful disposition, they submitted without reluctance to the superiority of his genius and fortune.
 (19) Discontent of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> at the apprehension of taxes II.
 The ambitious spirit of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> was scarcely reconciled to the disappointment of his views upon the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> provinces before the unexpected loss of <GPE>Italy</GPE> wounded his pride as well as power in a still more sensible part.
 The long absence of the emperors had filled <GPE>Rome</GPE> with discontent and indignation; and the people gradually discovered that the preference given to <GPE>Nicomedia</GPE> and <GPE>Milan</GPE> was not to be ascribed to the particular inclination of Diocletian, but to the permanent form of government which he had instituted.
 It was in vain that, a few months after his abdication, his successors dedicated, under his name, those magnificent baths whose ruins still supply the ground as well as the materials for so many churches and convents.
 (20) The tranquillity of those elegant recesses of ease and luxury was disturbed by the impatient murmurs of the Romans, and a report was insensibly circulated that the sums expended in erecting those buildings would soon be required at their hands.
 About that time the avarice of Galerius, or perhaps the exigencies of the state, had induced him to make a very strict and rigorous inquisition into the property of his subjects for the purpose of a general taxation, both on their lands and on their persons.
 A very minute survey appears to have been taken of their real estates; and, wherever there was the slightest suspicion of concealment, torture was very freely employed to obtain a sincere declaration of their personal wealth.
 (21) The privileges which had exalted <GPE>Italy</GPE> above the rank of the provinces were no longer regarded: and the officers of the revenue already began to number the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, and to settle the proportion of the new taxes.
 Even when the spirit of freedom had been utterly extinguished, the tamest subjects have sometimes ventured to resist an unprecedented invasion of their property; but on this occasion the injury was aggravated by the insult, and the sense of private interest was quickened by that of national honour.
 The conquest of Macedonia, as we have already observed, had delivered the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people from the weight of personal taxes.
 Though they had experienced every form of despotism, they had now enjoyed that exemption near <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred years; nor could they patiently brook the insolence of an <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> peasant, who, from his distant residence in Asia, presumed to number <GPE>Rome</GPE> among the tributary cities of his empire.
 The rising fury of the people was encouraged by the authority, or at least the connivance, of the senate; and the feeble remains of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards, who had reason to apprehend their own dissolution, embraced so honourable a pretence, and declared their readiness to draw their swords in the service of their oppressed country.
 It was the wish, and it soon became the hope, of every citizen that, after expelling from <GPE>Italy</GPE> their foreign tyrants, they should elect a prince who, by the place of his residence, and by his maxims of government, might once more deserve the title of <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor.
 The name, as well as the situation of Maxentius, determined in his favour the popular enthusiasm.
 <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> declared emperor at Rome.
 A.
D.
 306 28th October <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> was the son of the emperor Maximian, and he had married the daughter of Galerius.
 His birth and alliance seemed to offer him the fairest promise of succeeding to the empire; but his vices and incapacity procured him the same exclusion from the dignity of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> which <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had deserved by a dangerous superiority of merit.
 The policy of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> preferred such associates as would never disgrace the choice, nor dispute the commands, of their benefactor.
 An obscure stranger was therefore raised to the throne of Italy, and the son of the late emperor of the <LOC>West</LOC> was left to enjoy the luxury of a private fortune in a villa a few miles distant from the capital.
 The gloomy passions of his soul, shame, vexation, and rage, were inflamed by envy on the news of Constantine's success; but the hopes of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> revived with the public discontent, and he was easily persuaded to unite his personal injury and pretensions with the cause of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> tribunes and a commissary of provisions undertook the management of the conspiracy; and, as every order of men was actuated by the same spirit, the immediate event was neither doubtful nor difficult.
 The praefect of the city and a few magistrates, who maintained their fidelity to Severus, were massacred by the guards; and Maxentius, invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ornaments, was acknowledged, by the applauding senate and people, as the protector of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> freedom and dignity.
 <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> re-assumes the purple It is uncertain whether <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> was previously acquainted with the conspiracy; but as soon as the standard of rebellion was erected at Rome, the old emperor broke from the retirement where the authority of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> had condemned him to pass a life of melancholy solitude, and concealed his returning ambition under the disguise of paternal tenderness.
 At the request of his son and of the senate he condescended to reassume the purple.
 His ancient dignity, his experience, and his fame in arms added strength as well as reputation to the party of Maxentius.
 (22) Defeat and death of <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> According to the advice, or rather the orders, of his colleague, the emperor <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> immediately hastened to Rome, in the full confidence that, by his unexpected celerity, he should easily suppress the tumult of an unwarlike populace, commanded by a licentious youth.
 But he found on his arrival the gates of the city shut against him, the walls filled with men and arms, an experienced general at the head of the rebels, and his own troops without spirit or affection.
 A large body of <NORP>Moors</NORP> deserted to the enemy, allured by the promise of a large donative ; and, if it be true that they had been levied by <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> in his African war, preferring the natural feelings of gratitude to the artificial ties of allegiance.
 Anulinus, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect, declared himself in favour of Maxentius, and drew after him the most considerable part of the troops accustomed to obey his commands.
 Rome, according to the expression of an orator, recalled her armies, and the unfortunate Severus, destitute of force and of counsel, retired, or rather fled, with precipitation to Ravenna.
 Here he might for some time have been safe.
 The fortifications of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> were able to resist the attempts, and the morasses that surrounded the town were sufficient to prevent the approach, of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> army.
 Thesea, which <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> commanded with a powerful fleet, secured him an inexhaustible supply of provisions, and gave a free entrance to the legions which, on the return of spring, would advance to his assistance from <GPE>Illyricum</GPE> and the East.
 Maximian, who conducted the siege in person, was soon convinced that he might waste his time and his army in the fruitless enterprise, and that he had nothing to hope either from force or famine.
 With an art more suitable to the character of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> than to his own, he directed his attack not so much against the walls of <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> as against the mind of Severus.
 The treachery which he had experienced disposed that unhappy prince to distrust the most sincere of his friends and adherents.
 The emissaries of <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> easily persuaded his credulity that a conspiracy was formed to betray the town, and prevailed upon his fears not to expose himself to the discretion of an irritated conqueror, but to accept the faith of an honourable capitulation.
 He was at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> received with humanity and treated with respect.
 <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> conducted the captive emperor to Rome, and gave him the most solemn assurances that he had secured his life by the resignation of the purple.
 But <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> could obtain only an easy death and an <NORP>Imperial</NORP> funeral.
 When the sentence was signified to him, the manner of executing it was left to his own choice; he preferred the favourite mode of the ancients, that of opening his veins; and, as soon as he expired, his body was carried to the sepulchre which had been constructed for the family of Gallienus.
 (23) <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> gives his daughter Fausta, and the title of Augustus, to Constantine.
A.
D.
 307.
 31st <DATE>March</DATE> Though the characters of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> had very little affinity with each other, their situation and interest were the same, and prudence seemed to require that they should unite their forces against the common enemy.
 Notwithstanding the superiority of his age and dignity, the indefatigable <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> passed the Alps, and, courting a personal interview with the sovereign of Gaul, carried with him his daughter <PERSON>Fausta</PERSON> as the pledge of the new alliance.
 The marriage was celebrated at <GPE>Arles</GPE> with every circumstance of magnificence; and the ancient colleague of Diocletian, who again asserted his claim to the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, conferred on his son-in-law and ally the title of Augustus.
 By consenting to receive that honour from Maximian, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> seemed to embrace the cause of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of the senate; but his professions were ambiguous, and his assistance slow and ineffectual.
 He considered with attention the approaching contest between the masters of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the emperor of the East, and was prepared to consult his own safety or ambition in the event of the war.
 (24) <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> invades <GPE>Italy</GPE> The importance of the occasion called for the presence and abilities of Galerius.
 At the head of a powerful army collected from <GPE>Illyricum</GPE> and the East, he entered Italy, resolved to revenge the death of <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> and to chastise the rebellious Romans; or, as he expressed his intentions, in the furious language of a barbarian, to extirpate the senate, and to destroy the people by the sword.
 But the skill of <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> had concerted a prudent system of defence.
 The invader found every place hostile, fortified, and inaccessible; and though he forced his way as far as Narni, within sixty miles of Rome, his dominion in <GPE>Italy</GPE> was confined to the narrow limits of his camp.
 Sensible of the increasing difficulties of his enterprise, the haughty <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> made the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> advances towards a reconciliation, and despatched <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of his most considerable officers to tempt the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes by the offer of a conference, and the declaration of his paternal regard for Maxentius, who might obtain much more from his liberality than he could hope from the doubtful chance of war.
 (25) The offers of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> were rejected with firmness, his perfidious friendship refused with contempt, and it was not long before he discovered that unless he provided for his safety by a timely retreat, he had some reason to apprehend the fate of Severus.
 The wealth which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> defended against his rapacious tyranny they freely contributed for his destruction.
 The name of Maximian, the popular arts of his son, the secret distribution of large sums, and the promise of still more liberal rewards, checked the ardour and corrupted the fidelity of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> legions; and when <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> at length gave the signal of the retreat, it was with some difficulty that he could prevail on his veterans not to desert a banner which had so often conducted them to victory and honour.
 A contemporary writer assigns <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> other causes for the failure of the expedition; but they are both of such a nature that a cautious historian will scarcely venture to adopt them.
 We are told that <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> who had formed a very imperfect notion of the greatness of <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the cities of the <LOC>East</LOC> with which he was acquainted, found his forces inadequate to the siege of that immense capital.
 But the extent of a city serves only to render it more accessible to the enemy: <GPE>Rome</GPE> had long since been accustomed to submit on the approach of a conqueror; nor could the temporary enthusiasm of the people have long contended against the discipline and valour of the legions.
 We are likewise informed that the legions themselves were struck with horror and remorse, and that those pious sons of the republic refused to violate the sanctity of their venerable parent.
 (26) But when we recollect with how much ease, in the more ancient civil wars, the zeal of party and the habits of military obedience had converted the native citizens of <GPE>Rome</GPE> into her most implacable enemies, we shall be inclined to distrust this extreme delicacy of strangers and barbarians who had never beheld <GPE>Italy</GPE> till they entered it in a hostile manner.
 Had they not been restrained by motives of a more interested nature, they would probably have answered <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> in the words of Caesar's veterans: These are indeed the expressions of a poet; but of a poet who has been distinguished, and even censured, for his strict adherence to the truth of history.
 (27)His retreat The legions of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> exhibited a very melancholy proof of their disposition by the ravages which they committed in their retreat.
 They murdered, they ravished, they plundered, they drove away the flocks and herds of the Italians; they burnt the villages through which they passed, and they endeavoured to destroy the country which it had not been in their power to subdue.
 During the whole march <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> hung on their rear, but he very prudently declined a general engagement with those brave and desperate veterans.
 His father had undertaken a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> journey into Gaul, with the hope of persuading Constantine, who had assembled an army on the frontier, to join the pursuit, and to complete the victory.
 But the actions of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were guided by reason, and not by resentment.
 He persisted in the wise resolution of maintaining a balance of power in the divided empire, and he no longer hated <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> when that aspiring prince had ceased to be an object of terror.
 (28) Elevation of Licius to the rank of Augustus;A.
d.
 307.
 Nov 11.
 The mind of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> was the most susceptible of the sterner passions, but it was not, however, incapable of a sincere and lasting friendship.
 Licinius, whose manners as well as character were not unlike his own, seems to have engaged both his affection and esteem.
 Their intimacy had commenced in the happier period, perhaps, of their youth and obscurity.
 It had been cemented by the freedom and dangers of a military life; they had advanced almost by equal steps through the successive honours of the service; and as soon as <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> was invested with the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> dignity, he seems to have conceived the design of raising his companion to the same rank with himself.
 During the short period of his prosperity, he considered the rank of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> as unworthy of the age and merit of Licinius, and rather chose to reserve for him the place of Constantius, and the empire of the West.
 While the emperor was employed in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> war, he intrusted his friend with the defence of the Danube; and immediately after his return from that unfortunate expedition he invested <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> with the vacant purple of Severus, resigning to his immediate command the provinces of Illyricum.
 (29)and of MaximinThe news of his promotion was no sooner carried into the East, than Maximin, who governed, or rather oppressed, the countries of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Syria, betrayed his envy and discontent, disdained the inferior name of Caesar, and, notwithstanding the prayers as well as arguments of Galerius, exacted, almost by violence, the equal title of Augustus.
 (30) For the first, and indeed for the last time, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world was administered by <CARDINAL>Six</CARDINAL> emperors.
 A.
D.
 308six emperors.
 In the West, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> affected to reverence their father Maximian.
 In the East, <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> honoured with more real consideration their benefactor Galerius.
 The opposition of interest, and the memory of a recent war, divided the empire into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great hostile powers; but their mutual fears produced an apparent tranquillity, and even a feigned reconciliation, till the death of the elder princes, of Maximian, and more particularly of Galerius, gave a new direction to the views and passions of their surviving associates.
 Misfortunes of <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> When <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> had reluctantly abdicated the empire, the venal orators of the times applauded his philosophic moderation.
 When his ambition excited, or at least encouraged, a civil war, they returned thanks to his generous patriotism, and gently censured that love of ease and retirement which had withdrawn him from the public service.
 (31) But it was impossible that minds like those of <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> and his son could long possess in harmony an undivided power.
 <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> considered himself as the legal sovereign of Italy, elected by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate and people; nor would he endure the control of his father, who arrogantly declared that by his name and abilities the rash youth had been established on the throne.
 The cause was solemnly pleaded before the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards; and those troops, who dreaded the severity of the old emperor, espoused the party of Maxentius.
 (32) The life and freedom of <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> were, however, respected, and he retired from <GPE>Italy</GPE> into Illyricum, affecting to lament his past conduct, and secretly contriving new mischiefs.
 But Galerius, who was well acquainted with his character, soon obliged him to leave his dominions, and the last refuge of the disappointed <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> was the court of his son-in-law Constantine.
 (33) He was received with respect by that artful prince, and with the appearance of filial tenderness by the empress Fausta.
 That he might remove every suspicion, he resigned the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time, (34) professing himself at length convinced of the vanity of greatness and ambition.
 Had he persevered in this resolution, he might have ended his life with less dignity, indeed, than in his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> retirement, yet, however, with comfort and reputation.
 But the near prospect of a throne brought back to his remembrance the state from whence he was fallen, and he resolved, by a desperate effort, either to reign or to perish.
 An incursion of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> had summoned Constantine, with a part of his army, to the banks of the Rhine, the remainder of the troops were stationed in the southern provinces of Gaul, which lay exposed to the enterprises of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> emperor, and a considerable treasure was deposited in the city of Arles.
 <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> either craftily invented, or hastily credited, a vain report of the death of Constantine.
 Without hesitation he ascended the throne, seized the treasure, and, scattering it with his accustomed profusion among the soldiers, endeavoured to awake in their minds the memory of his ancient dignity and exploits.
 Before he could establish his authority, or finish the negotiation which he appears to have entered into with his son Maxentius, the celerity of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> defeated all his hopes.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> news of his perfidy and ingratitude, that prince returned by rapid marches from the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> to the Saone, embarked on the last-mentioned river at Chalons, and, at <PERSON>Lyons</PERSON> trusting himself to the rapidity of the Rhone, arrived at the gates of <GPE>Arles</GPE> with a military force which it was impossible for <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> to resist, and which scarcely permitted him to take refuge in the neighbouring city of Marseilles.
 The narrow neck of land which joined that place to the continent was fortified against the besiegers, whilst the sea was open, either for the escape of Maximian, or for the succours of Maxentius, if the latter should choose to disguise his invasion of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> under the honourable pretence of defending a distressed, or, as he might allege, an injured father.
 Apprehensive of the fatal consequences of delay, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> gave orders for an immediate assault; but the scaling-ladders were found too short for the height of the walls, and <GPE>Marseilles</GPE> might have sustained as long a siege as it formerly did against the arms of Caesar, if the garrison, conscious either of their fault or of their danger, had not purchased their pardon by delivering up the city and the person of Maximian.
 His death.
 A.
D.
 310.
 <DATE>February</DATE> A secret but irrevocable sentence of death was pronounced against the usurper he obtained only the same favour which he had indulged to Severus, and it was published to the world that, oppressed by the remorse of his repeated crimes, he strangled himself with his own hands.
 After he had lost the assistance, and disdained the moderate counsels, of Diocletian, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> period of his active life was a series of public calamities and personal mortifications, which were terminated, in about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, by an ignominious death.
 He deserved his fate; but we should find more reason to applaud the humanity of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> if he had spared an old man, the benefactor of his father and the father of his wife.
 During the whole of this melancholy transaction, it appears that <PERSON>Fausta</PERSON> sacrificed the sentiments of nature to her conjugal duties.
 (35) Death of Galerius.
 A.
D.
 311.
 May The last <DATE>years</DATE> of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> were less shameful and unfortunate; and though he had filled with more glory the subordinate station of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> than the superior rank of Augustus, he preserved, till the moment of his death, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> place among the princes of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 He survived his retreat from <GPE>Italy</GPE> about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years; and, wisely relinquishing his views of universal empire, he devoted the remainder of his life to the enjoyment of pleasure and to the execution of some works of public utility, among which we may distinguish the discharging into the <LOC>Danube</LOC> the superfluous waters of the lake Pelso, and the cutting down the immense forests that encompassed it: an operation worthy of a monarch, since it gave an extensive country to the agriculture of his <NORP>Pannonian</NORP> subjects.
 (36) His death was occasioned by a very painful and lingering disorder.
 His body, swelled by an intemperate course of life to an unwieldy corpulence, was covered with ulcers, and devoured by innumerable swarms of those insects who have given their name to a most loathsome disease; (37) but as <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> had offended a very zealous and powerful party among his subjects, his sufferings, instead of exciting their compassion, have been celebrated as the visible effects of divine justice.
 (38) His dominion shared between <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> and <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> He had no sooner expired in his palace of <GPE>Nicomedia</GPE> than the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors, who were indebted for their purple to his favour, began to collect their forces, with the intention either of disputing or of dividing the dominions which he had left without a master.
 They were persuaded, however, to desist from the former design, and to agree in the latter.
 The provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> fell to the share of Maximin, and those of <LOC>Europe</LOC> augmented the portion of Licinius.
 The <PRODUCT>Hellespont</PRODUCT> and the Thracian <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> formed their mutual boundary, and the banks of those narrow seas, which flowed in the midst of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, were covered with soldiers, with arms and with fortifications.
 The deaths of <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> and of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> reduced the number of emperors to four.
 The sense of their true interest soon connected <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> and Constantine; a secret alliance was concluded between <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> and Maxentius, and their unhappy subjects expected with terror the bloody consequences of their inevitable dissensions, which were no longer restrained by the fear or the respect which they had entertained for Galerius.
 (39) Administration of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> in Gaul.
 A.
D.
 306-312 Among so many crimes and misfortunes, occasioned by the passions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes, there is some pleasure in discovering a single action which may be ascribed to their virtue.
 In the sixth year of his reign <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> visited the city of Autun, and generously remitted the arrears of tribute, reducing at the same time the proportion of their assessment from <CARDINAL>twenty-five</CARDINAL> to eighteen thousand heads, subject to the real and personal capitation.
 (40) Yet even this indulgence affords the most unquestionable proof of the public misery.
 This tax was so extremely oppressive, either in itself or in the mode of collecting it, that, whilst the revenue was increased by extortion, it was diminished by despair: a considerable part of the territory of <GPE>Autun</GPE> was left uncultivated; and great numbers of the provincials rather chose to live as exiles and outlaws than to support the weight of civil society.
 It is but too probable that the bountiful emperor relieved, by a partial act of liberality, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> among the many evils which he had caused by his general maxims of administration.
 But even those maxims were less the effect of choice than of necessity.
 And if we except the death of Maximian, the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> in <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> seems to have been the most innocent and even virtuous period of his life.
 The provinces were protected by his presence from the inroads of the barbarians, who either dreaded or experienced his active valour.
 After a signal victory over the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni, several of their princes were exposed by his order to the wild beasts in the amphitheatre of Treves, and the people seem to have enjoyed the spectacle, without discovering, in such a treatment of royal captives, anything that was repugnant to the laws of nations or of humanity.
 (41) Tyranny of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Africa.
 A.
D.
 306-312 The virtues of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were rendered more illustrious by the vices of Maxentius.
 Whilst the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> provinces enjoyed as much happiness as the condition of the times was capable of receiving, <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> groaned under the dominion of a tyrant as contemptible as he was odious.
 The zeal of flattery and faction has indeed too frequently sacrificed the reputation of the vanquished to the glory of their successful rivals; but even those writers who have revealed, with the most freedom and pleasure, the faults of Constantine, unanimously confess that <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> was cruel, rapacious, and profligate.
 (42) He had the good fortune to suppress a slight rebellion in Africa.
 The governor and a few adherents had been guilty; the province suffered for their crime.
 The flourishing cities of <GPE>Cirtha</GPE> and Carthage, and the whole extent of that fertile country, were wasted by fire and sword.
 The abuse of victory was followed by the abuse of law and justice.
 A formidable army of sycophants and delators invaded Africa; the rich and the noble were easily convicted of a connection with the rebels, and those among them who experienced the emperor's clemency were only punished by the confiscation of their estates.
 (43) So signal a victory was celebrated by a magnificent triumph, and <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> exposed to the eyes of the people the spoils and captives of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> province.
 The state of the capital was no less deserving of compassion than that of Africa.
 The wealth of <GPE>Rome</GPE> supplied an inexhaustible fund for his vain and prodigal expenses, and the ministers of his revenue were skilled in the arts of rapine.
 It was under his reign that the method of exacting a free gift from the senators was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> invented; and as the sum was insensibly increased, the pretences of levying it, a victory, a birth, a marriage, or an <NORP>Imperial</NORP> consulship, were proportionately multiplied.
 (44) <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> had imbibed the same implacable aversion to the senate which had characterised most of the former tyrants of Rome; nor was it possible for his ungrateful temper to forgive the generous fidelity which had raised him to the throne and supported him against all his enemies.
 The lives of the senators were exposed to his jealous suspicions, the dishonour of their wives and daughters heightened the gratification of his sensual passions.
 (45) It may be presumed that an <NORP>Imperial</NORP> lover was seldom reduced to sigh in vain; but whenever persuasion proved ineffectual, he had recourse to violence; and there remains <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> memorable example of a noble matron who preserved her chastity by a voluntary death.
 The soldiers were the only order of men whom he appeared to respect, or studied to please.
 He filled <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> with armed troops, connived at their tumults, suffered them with impunity to plunder, and even to massacre, the defenceless people; (46) and indulging them in the same licentiousness which their emperor enjoyed, <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> often bestowed on his military favourites the splendid villa, or the beautiful wife, of a senator.
 A prince, of such a character, alike incapable of governing either in peace or in war, might purchase the support, but he could never obtain the esteem, of the army.
 Yet his pride was equal to his other vices.
 Whilst he passed his indolent life, either within the walls of his palace or in the neighbouring gardens of Sallust, he was repeatedly heard to declare that he alone was emperor, and that the other princes were no more than his lieutenants, on whom he had devolved the defence of the frontier provinces, that he might enjoy without interruption the elegant luxury of the capital.
 Rome, which had so long regretted the absence, lamented, during the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> of his reign, the presence of her sovereign.
 (47) Civil war between <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Maxentius.
 A.
D.
 312.
 Though <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> might view the conduct of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> with abhorrence, and the situation of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> with compassion, we have no reason to presume that he would have taken up arms to punish the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> or to relieve the other.
 But the tyrant of <GPE>Italy</GPE> rashly ventured to provoke a formidable enemy whose ambition had been hitherto restrained by considerations of prudence rather than by principles of justice.
 (48) After the death of Maximian, his titles according to the established custom, had been erased, and his statues thrown down with ignominy.
 His son, who had persecuted and deserted him when alive, affected to display the most pious regard for his memory, and gave orders that a similar treatment should be immediately inflicted on all the statues that had been erected in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> to the honour of Constantine.
 That wise prince, who sincerely wished to decline a war, with the difficulty and importance of which he was sufficiently acquainted, at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> dissembled the insult, and sought for redress by the milder expedients of negotiation, till he was convinced that the hostile and ambitious designs of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> emperor made it necessary for him to arm in his own defence.
 Maxentius, who openly avowed his pretensions to the whole monarchy of the West, had already prepared a very considerable force to invade the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> provinces on the side of Rhaetia; and though he could not expect any assistance from Licinius, he was flattered with the hope that the legions of Illyricum, allured by his presents and promises, would desert the standard of that prince and unanimously declare themselves his soldiers and subjects.
 (49) <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> no longer hesitated.
 He had deliberated with caution, he acted with vigour.
 He gave a private audience to the ambassadors who, in the name of the senate and people, conjured him to deliver <GPE>Rome</GPE> from a detested tyrant; and, without regarding the timid remonstrances of his council, he resolved to prevent the enemy, and to carry the war into the heart of Italy.
 (50) Preparations The enterprise was as full of danger as of glory; and the unsuccessful event of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former invasions was sufficient to inspire the most serious apprehensions.
 The veteran troops, who revered the name of Maximian, had embraced in both those wars the party of his son, and were now restrained by a sense of honour, as well as of interest, from entertaining an idea of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> desertion.
 Maxentius, who considered the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards as the firmest defence of his throne, had increased them to their ancient establishment; and they composed, including the rest of the <NORP>Italians</NORP> who were enlisted into his service, a formidable body of four-score thousand men.
 Forty thousand <NORP>Moors</NORP> and <NORP>Carthaginians</NORP> had been raised since the reduction of Africa.
 Even <GPE>Sicily</GPE> furnished its proportion of troops; and the armies of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> amounted to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and seventy thousand foot and eighteen thousand horse.
 The wealth of <GPE>Italy</GPE> supplied the expenses of the war; and the adjacent provinces were exhausted to form immense magazines of corn and every other kind of provisions.
 The whole force of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> consisted of ninety thousand foot and eight thousand horse (51) and as the defence of the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> required an extraordinary attention during the absence of the emperor, it was not in his power to employ above <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> his troops in the <NORP>Italian</NORP> expedition, unless he sacrificed the public safety to his private quarrel.
 (52) At the head of about forty thousand soldiers, he marched to encounter an enemy whose numbers were at least <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> times superior to his own.
 But the armies of Rome, placed at a secure distance from danger, were enervated by indulgence and luxury.
 Habituated to the baths and theatres of Rome, they took the field with reluctance, and were chiefly composed of veterans who had almost forgotten, or of new levies who had never acquired, the use of arms and the practice of war.
 The hardy legions of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> had long defended the frontiers of the empire against the barbarians of the North; and in the performance of that laborious service their valour was exercised and their discipline confirmed.
 There appeared the same difference between the leaders as between the armies.
 Caprice or flattery had tempted <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> with the hopes of conquest; but these aspiring hopes soon gave way to the habits of pleasure and the consciousness of his inexperience.
 The intrepid mind of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had been trained from his earliest youth to war, to action, and to military command.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> passes the <LOC>Alps</LOC> When <PERSON>Hannibal</PERSON> marched from <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> into Italy, he was obliged <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to discover and then to open a way over mountains, and through savage nations that had never yielded a passage to a regular army.
 (53) The <LOC>Alps</LOC> were then guarded by nature, they are now fortified by art.
 Citadels, constructed with no less skill than labour and expense, command every avenue into the plain, and on that side render <GPE>Italy</GPE> almost inaccessible to the enemies of the king of Sardinia.
 (54) But in the course of the intermediate period, the generals who have attempted the passage have seldom experienced any difficulty or resistance.
 In the age of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the peasants of the mountains were civilised and obedient subjects; the country was plentifully stocked with provisions, and the stupendous highways which the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had carried over the <LOC>Alps</LOC> opened several communications between <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> and Italy.
 (55) <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> preferred the road of the Cottian Alps, or, as it is now called, of Mount Cenis, and led his troops with such active diligence, that he descended into the plain of <GPE>Piedmont</GPE> before the court of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> had received any certain intelligence of his departure from the banks of the Rhine.
 The city of Susa, however, which is situated at the foot of Mount Cenis, was surrounded with walls, and provided with a garrison sufficiently numerous to check the progress of an invader; but the impatience of Constantine's troops disdained the tedious forms of a siege.
 The same day that they appeared before <PERSON>Susa</PERSON> they applied fire to the gates and ladders to the walls; and mounting to the assault amidst a shower of stones and arrows, they entered the place sword in hand, and cut in pieces the greatest part of the garrison.
 The flames were extinguished by the care of Constantine, and the remains of <PERSON>Susa</PERSON> preserved from total destruction.
 About forty miles from thence a more severe contest awaited him.
 Battle of <GPE>TurinA</GPE> numerous army of <NORP>Italians</NORP> was assembled, under the lieutenants of Maxentius, in the plains of Turin.
 Its principal strength consisted in a species of heavy cavalry, which the Romans, since the decline of their discipline, had borrowed from the nations of the East.
 The horses, as well as the men, were clothed in complete armour, the joints of which were artfully adapted to the motions of their bodies.
 The aspect of this cavalry was formidable, their weight almost irresistible; and as, on this occasion, their generals had drawn them up in a compact column or wedge, with a sharp point, and with spreading flanks, they flattered themselves that they should easily break and trample down the army of Constantine.
 They might, perhaps, have succeeded in their design, had not their experienced adversary embraced the same method of defence which in similar circumstances had been practised by Aurelian.
 The skilful evolutions of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> divided and baffled this massy column of cavalry.
 The troops of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> fled in confusion towards Turin; and as the gates of the city were shut against them, very few escaped the sword of the victorious pursuers.
 By this important service <GPE>Turin</GPE> deserved to experience the clemency and even favour of the conqueror.
 He made his entry into the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> palace of Milan, and almost all the cities of <GPE>Italy</GPE> between the <LOC>Alps</LOC> and the <PERSON>Po</PERSON> not only acknowledged the power, but embraced with zeal the party of Constantine.
 (56) Siege and battle of <GPE>Verona</GPE> From <GPE>Milan</GPE> to Rome, the <NORP>Emilian</NORP> and <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> highways offered an easy march of about <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred miles; but though <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was impatient to encounter the tyrant, he prudently directed his operations against another army of Italians, who, by their strength and position, might either oppose his progress, or, in case of a misfortune, might intercept his retreat.
 Ruricius Pompeianus, a general distinguished by his valour and ability, had under his command the city of Verona, and all the troops that were stationed in the province of Venetia.
 As soon as he was informed that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was advancing towards him, he detached a large body of cavalry, which was defeated in an engagement near Brescia, and pursued by the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> legions as far as the gates of Verona.
 The necessity, the importance, and the difficulties of the siege of Verona, immediately presented themselves to the sagacious mind of Constantine.
 (57) The city was accessible only by a narrow peninsula towards the west, as the other <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sides were surrounded by the Adige, a rapid river, which covered the province of Venetia, from whence the besieged derived an inexhaustible supply of men and provisions.
 It was not without great difficulty, and after several fruitless attempts, that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> found means to pass the river at some distance above the city, and in a place where the torrent was less violent.
 He then encompassed <GPE>Verona</GPE> with strong lines, pushed his attacks with prudent vigour, and repelled a desperate sally of Pompeianus.
 That intrepid general, when he had used every means of defence that the strength of the place or that of the garrison could afford, secretly escaped from Verona, anxious not for his own but for the public safety.
 With indefatigable diligence he soon collected an army sufficient either to meet <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> in the field, or to attack him if he obstinately remained within his lines.
 The emperor, attentive to the motions, and informed of the approach of so formidable an enemy, left a part of his legions to continue the operations of the siege, whilst, at the head of those troops on whose valour and fidelity he more particularly depended, he advanced in person to engage the general of Maxentius.
 The army of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was drawn up in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> lines, according to the usual practice of war; but their experienced leader, perceiving that the numbers of the <NORP>Italians</NORP> far exceeded his own, suddenly changed his disposition, and, reducing the second, extended the front of his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> line to a just proportion with that of the enemy Such evolutions, which only veteran troops can execute without confusion in a moment of danger, commonly prove decisive; but as this engagement began towards the close of the day, and was contested with great obstinacy during the whole night, there was less room for the conduct of the generals than for the courage of the soldiers.
 The return of light displayed the victory of Constantine, and a field of carnage covered with many <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the vanquished Italians.
 Their general, Pompeianus, was found among the slain; <GPE>Verona</GPE> immediately surrendered at discretion, and the garrison was made prisoners of war.
 (58) When the officers of the victorious army congratulated their master on this important success, they ventured to add some respectful complaints, of such a nature, however, as the most jealous monarchs will listen to without displeasure.
 They represented to <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> that, not contented with performing all the duties of a commander, he had exposed his own person with an excess of valour which almost degenerated into rashness; and they conjured him for the future to pay more regard to the preservation of a life in which the safety of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of the empire was involved.
 (59) Indolence and fears of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> While <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> signalised his conduct and valour in the field, the sovereign of <GPE>Italy</GPE> appeared insensible of the calamities and danger of a civil war which raged in the heart of his dominions.
 Pleasure was still the only business of Maxentius.
 Concealing, or at least attempting to conceal, from the public knowledge the misfortunes of his arms, (60) he indulged himself in a vain confidence, which deferred the remedies of the approaching evil without deferring the evil itself.
 (61) The rapid progress of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> (62) was scarcely sufficient to awaken him from this fatal security; he flattered himself that his well-known liberality and the majesty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name, which had already delivered him from <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> invasions, would dissipate with the same facility the rebellious army of Gaul.
 The officers of experience and ability who had served under the banners of <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> were at length compelled to inform his effeminate son of the imminent danger to which he was reduced; and, with a freedom that at once surprised and convinced him, to urge the necessity of preventing his ruin by a vigorous exertion of his remaining power.
 The resources of Maxentius, both of men and money, were still considerable.
 The <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards felt how strongly their own interest and safety were connected with his cause; and a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> army was soon collected, more numerous than those which had been lost in the battles of <GPE>Turin</GPE> and Verona.
 It was far from the intention of the emperor to lead his troops in person.
 A stranger to the exercises of war, he trembled at the apprehension of so dangerous a contest; and, as fear is commonly superstitious, he listened with melancholy attention to the rumours of omens and presages which seemed to menace his life and empire.
 Shame at length supplied the place of courage, and forced him to take the field.
 He was unable to sustain the contempt of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 The circus resounded with their indignant clamours, and they tumultuously besieged the gates of the palace, reproaching the pusillanimity of their indolent sovereign, and celebrating the heroic spirit of Constantine.
 (63) Before <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> left <GPE>Rome</GPE> he consulted the <PERSON>Sibylline</PERSON> books.
 The guardians of these ancient oracles were as well versed in the arts of this world as they were ignorant of the secrets of fate; and they returned him a very prudent answer, which might adapt itself to the event, and secure their reputation, whatever should be the chance of arms.
 (64) Victory of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> near Rome.
A.
D.
 312.
 28th Oct.
 The celerity of Constantine's march has been compared to the rapid conquest of <GPE>Italy</GPE> by the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the Caesars; nor is the flattering parallel repugnant to the truth of history, since no more than fifty-eight days elapsed between the surrender of <GPE>Verona</GPE> and the final decision of the war.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had always apprehended that the tyrant would consult the dictates of fear, and perhaps of prudence; and that, instead of risking his last hopes in a general engagement, he would shut himself up within the walls of Rome.
 His ample magazines secured him against the danger of famine; and as the situation of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> admitted not of delay, he might have been reduced to the sad necessity of destroying with fire and sword the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> city, the noblest reward of his victory, and the deliverance of which had been the motive, or rather indeed the pretence, of the civil war.
 (65) It was with equal surprise and pleasure that, on his arrival at a place called Saxa Rubra, about nine miles from Rome, (66) he discovered the army of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> prepared to give him battle.
 (67) Their long front filled a very spacious plain, and their deep array reached to the banks of the Tiber, which covered their rear, and forbade their retreat.
 We are informed, and we may believe, that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> disposed his troops with consummate skill, and that he chose for himself the post of honour and danger.
 Distinguished by the splendour of his arms, he charged in person the cavalry of his rival; and his irresistible attack determined the fortune of the day.
 The cavalry of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> was principally composed either of unwieldy cuirassiers or of light <NORP>Moors</NORP> and Numidians.
 They yielded to the vigour of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> horse, which possessed more activity than the one, more firmness than the other.
 The defeat of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> wings left the infantry without any protection on its flanks, and the undisciplined <NORP>Italians</NORP> fled without reluctance from the standard of a tyrant whom they had always hated, and whom they no longer feared.
 The Praetorians, conscious that their offences were beyond the reach of mercy, were animated by revenge and despair.
 Notwithstanding their repeated efforts, those brave veterans were unable to recover the victory; they obtained, however, an honourable death; and it was observed that their bodies covered the same ground which had been occupied by their ranks.
 (68) The confusion then became general, and the dismayed troops of Maxentius, pursued by an implacable enemy, rushed by <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> into the deep and rapid stream of the Tiber.
 The emperor himself attempted to escape back into the city over the Milvian bridge, but the crowds which pressed together through that narrow passage forced him into the river, where he was immediately drowned by the weight of his armour.
 (69) His body, which had sunk very deep into the mud, was found with some difficulty the next day.
 The sight of his head, when it was exposed to the eyes of the people, convinced them of their deliverance, and admonished them to receive with acclamations of loyalty and gratitude the fortunate Constantine, who thus achieved by his valour and ability the most splendid enterprise of his life.
 (70) His reception In the use of victory <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> neither deserved the praise of clemency nor incurred the censure of immoderate rigour.
 (71) He inflicted the same treatment to which a defeat would have exposed his own person and family, put to death the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons of the tyrant, and carefully extirpated his whole race.
 The most distinguished adherents of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> must have expected to share his fate, as they had shared his prosperity and his crimes; but when the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people loudly demanded a greater number of victims, the conqueror resisted, with firmness and humanity, those servile clamours, which were dictated by flattery as well as by resentment.
 Informers were punished and discouraged, the innocent who had suffered under the late tyranny were recalled from exile, and restored to their estates.
 A general act of oblivion quieted the minds and settled the property of the people both in <GPE>Italy</GPE> and in Africa.
 (72) The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> honoured the senate with his presence he recapitulated his own services and exploits in a modest oration, assured that illustrious order of his sincere regard, and promised to re-establish its ancient duty and privileges.
 The grateful senate repaid these unmeaning professions by the empty titles of honour which it was yet in their power to bestow; and, without presuming to ratify the authority of Constantine, they passed a decree to assign him the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rank among the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <NORP>Augusti</NORP> who governed the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 (73) Games and festivals were instituted to preserve the fame of his victory, and several edifices, raised at the expense of Maxentius, were dedicated to the honour of his successful rival.
 The triumphal arch of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> still remains a melancholy proof of the decline of the arts, and a singular testimony of the meanest vanity.
 As it was not possible to find in the capital of the empire a sculptor who was capable of adorning that public monument, the arch of Trajan, without any respect either for his memory or for the rules of propriety, was stripped of its most elegant figures.
 The difference of times and persons, of actions and characters, was totally disregarded.
 The <NORP>Parthian</NORP> captives appear prostrate at the feet of a prince who never carried his arms beyond the Euphrates; and curious antiquarians can still discover the head of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> on the trophies of Constantine.
 The new ornaments which it was necessary to introduce between the vacancies of ancient sculpture are executed in the rudest and most unskilful manner.
 (74) And conduct at <GPE>Rome</GPE> The final abolition of the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> guards was a measure of prudence as well as of revenge.
 Those haughty troops, whose numbers and privileges had been restored, and even augmented, by Maxentius, were forever suppressed by Constantine.
 Their fortified camp was destroyed, and the few <NORP>Praetorians</NORP> who had escaped the fury of the sword were dispersed among the legions and banished to the frontiers of the empire, where they might be serviceable without again becoming dangerous.
 (75) By suppressing the troops which were usually stationed in Rome, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> gave the fatal blow to the dignity of the senate and people, and the disarmed capital was exposed, without protection, to the insults or neglect of its distant master.
 We may observe that, in this last effort to preserve their expiring freedom, the Romans, from the apprehension of a tribute, had raised <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> to the throne.
 He exacted that tribute from the senate under the name of a free gift.
 They implored the assistance of Constantine.
 He vanquished the tyrant, and converted the free gift into a perpetual tax.
 The senators, according to the declaration which was required of their property, were divided into several classes.
 The most opulent paid annually eight pounds of gold, the next class paid four, the last two, and those whose poverty might have claimed an exemption were assessed however, at <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> pieces of gold.
 Besides the regular members of the senate, their sons, their descendants, and even their relations, enjoyed the vain privileges and supported the heavy burdens of the senatorial order; nor will it any longer excite our surprise that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> should be attentive to increase the number of persons who were included under so useful a description.
 (76) After the defeat of <PERSON>Maxentius</PERSON> the victorious emperor passed no more than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> months in Rome, which he visited twice during the remainder of his life to celebrate the solemn festivals of the tenth and of the twentieth <DATE>years</DATE> of his reign.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was almost perpetually in motion, to exercise the legions or to inspect the state of the provinces.
 Treves, Milan, Aquileia, Sirmium, <GPE>Naissus</GPE> and <GPE>Thessalonica</GPE> were the occasional places of his residence till he founded a NEW ROME on the confines of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia.
 (77) His alliance with Licinius.
 A.

 313.
 <DATE>March</DATE> Before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> marched into <GPE>Italy</GPE> he had secured the friendship, or at least the neutrality, of Licinius, the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> emperor.
 He had promised his sister <PERSON>Constantia</PERSON> in marriage to that prince; but the celebration of the nuptials was deferred till after the conclusion of the war, and the interview of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors at Milan, which was appointed for that purpose, appeared to cement the union of their families and interests.
 (78) In the midst of the public festivity they were suddenly obliged to take leave of each other.
 An inroad of the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> summoned <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to the Rhine, and the hostile approach of the sovereign of <LOC>Asia</LOC> demanded the immediate presence of Licinius.
 War between <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> and Licinius.
 A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>313</CARDINAL> <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> had been the secret ally of Maxentius, and, without being discouraged by his fate, he resolved to try the fortune of a civil war.
 He moved out of Syria, towards the frontiers of Bithynia, in the depth of winter.
 The season was severe and tempestuous; great numbers of men as well as horses perished in the snow; and as the roads were broken up by incessant rains, he was obliged to leave behind him a considerable part of the heavy baggage, which was unable to follow the rapidity of his forced marches.
 By this extraordinary effort of diligence, he arrived, with a harassed but formidable army, on the banks of the Thracian <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> before the lieutenants of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> were apprised of his hostile intentions.
 <GPE>Byzantium</GPE> surrendered to the power of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> after a siege of eleven days.
 He was detained some days under the walls of Heraclea; and he had no sooner taken possession of that city than he was alarmed by the intelligence that <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> had pitched his camp at the distance of only eighteen miles.
 After a fruitless negotiation, in which the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes attempted to seduce the fidelity of each other's adherents, they had recourse to arms.
 the defeat, April 30,The emperor of the <LOC>East</LOC> commanded a disciplined and veteran army of above seventy thousand men; and Licinius, who had collected about thirty thousand Illyrians, was at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> oppressed by the superiority of numbers.
 His military skill and the firmness of his troops restored the day and obtained a decisive victory.
 The incredible speed which <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> exerted in his flight is much more celebrated than his prowess in the battle.
 Twenty-four hours afterwards he was seen pale, trembling, and without his <NORP>Imperial</NORP> ornaments, at Nicomedia, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty miles from the place of his defeat.
 The wealth of <LOC>Asia</LOC> was yet unexhausted; and though the flower of his veterans had fallen in the late action, he had still power, if he could obtain time, to draw very numerous levies from <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Egypt.
 But he survived his misfortune only <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> months.
 and death of the former August.
His death, which happened at Tarsus, was variously ascribed to despair, to poison, and to the divine justice.
 As <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> was alike destitute of abilities and of virtue, he was lamented neither by the people nor by the soldiers.
 The provinces of the East, delivered from the terrors of civil war, cheerfully acknowledged the authority of Licinius.
 (79) Cruelty of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> The vanquished emperor left behind him <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> children, a boy of about eight, and a girl of about seven, <DATE>years</DATE> old.
 Their inoffensive age might have excited compassion; but the compassion of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> was a very feeble resource, nor did it restrain him from extinguishing the name and memory of his adversary.
 The death of <PERSON>Severianus</PERSON> will admit of less excuse, as it was dictated neither by revenge nor by policy.
 The conqueror had never received any injury from the father of that unhappy youth, and the short and obscure reign of Severus, in a distant part of the empire, was already forgotten.
 But the execution of <PERSON>Candidianus</PERSON> was an act of the blackest cruelty and ingratitude.
 He was the natural son of Galerius, the friend and benefactor of Licinius.
 The prudent father had judged him too young to sustain the weight of a diadem; but he hoped that, under the protection of princes who were indebted to his favour for the imperial purple, <PERSON>Candidianus</PERSON> might pass a secure and honourable life.
 He was now advancing towards the twentieth year of his age, and the royalty of his birth, though unsupported either by merit or ambition, was sufficient to exasperate the jealous mind of Licinius.
 (80) To these innocent and illustrious victims of his tyranny we must add the wife and daughter of the emperor Diocletian.
 When that prince conferred on <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> the title of Caesar, he had given him in marriage his daughter Valeria, Unfortunate fate of the empress <PERSON>Valeria</PERSON> and her motherwhose melancholy adventures might furnish a very singular subject for tragedy.
 She had fulfilled and even surpassed the duties of a wife.
 As she had not any children herself, she condescended to adopt the illegitimate son of her husband, and invariably displayed towards the unhappy <PERSON>Candidianus</PERSON> the tenderness and anxiety of a real mother.
 After the death of Galerius, her ample possessions provoked the avarice, and her personal attractions excited the desires, of his successor, Maximin.
 (81) He had a wife still alive; but divorce was permitted by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> law, and the fierce passions of the tyrant demanded an immediate gratification.
 The answer of <PERSON>Valeria</PERSON> was such as became the daughter and widow of emperors; but it was tempered by the prudence which her defenceless condition compelled her to observe.
 She represented to the persons whom <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> had employed on this occasion, On this repulse, the love of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> was converted into fury; and as witnesses and judges were always at his disposal, it was easy for him to cover his fury with an appearance of legal proceedings, and to assault the reputation as well as the happiness of Valeria.
 Her estates were confiscated, her eunuchs and domestics devoted to the most inhuman tortures; and several innocent and respectable matrons, who were honoured with her friendship, suffered death, on a false accusation of adultery.
 The empress herself, together with her mother Prisca, was condemned to exile; and as they were ignominiously hurried from place to place before they were confined to a sequestered village in the deserts of Syria, they exposed their shame and distress to the provinces of the East, which, during thirty years, had respected their august dignity.
 <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> made several ineffectual efforts to alleviate the misfortunes of his daughter; and, as the last return that he expected for the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, which he had conferred upon Maximin, he entreated that <PERSON>Valeria</PERSON> might be permitted to share his retirement of Salona, and to close the eyes of her afflicted father.
 (83) He entreated; but as he could no longer threaten, his prayers were received with coldness and disdain; and the pride of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> was gratified in treating <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> as a suppliant, and his daughter as a criminal.
 The death of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> seemed to assure the empresses of a favourable alteration in their fortune.
 The public disorders relaxed the vigilance of their guard, and they easily found means to escape from the place of their exile, and to repair, though with some precaution, and in disguise, to the court of Licinius.
 His behaviour, in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> days of his reign, and the honourable reception which he gave to young Candidianus, inspired <PERSON>Valeria</PERSON> with a secret satisfaction, both on her own account, and on that of her adopted son.
 But these grateful prospects were soon succeeded by horror and astonishment; and the bloody executions which stained the palace of <GPE>Nicomedia</GPE> sufficiently convinced her that the throne of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> was filled by a tyrant more inhuman than himself.
 <PERSON>Valeria</PERSON> consulted her safety by a hasty flight, and, still accompanied by her mother Prisca, they wandered above fifteen months (84) through the provinces, concealed in the disguise of plebeian habits.
 They were at length discovered at Thessalonica; and as the sentence of their death was already pronounced, they were immediately beheaded, and their bodies thrown into the sea.
 The people gazed on the melancholy spectacle; but their grief and indignation were suppressed by the terrors of a military guard.
 Such was the unworthy fate of the wife and daughter of Diocletian.
 We lament their misfortunes, we cannot discover their crimes; and whatever idea we may justly entertain of the cruelty of Licinius, it remains a matter of surprise that he was not contented with some more secret and decent method of revenge.
 (85) Quarrel between <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Licinius.
 A.
D.
 314 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> world was now divided between <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Licinius, the former of whom was master of the West, and the latter of the East.
 It might perhaps have been expected that the conquerors, fatigued with civil war, and connected by a private as well as public alliance, would have renounced, or at least would have suspended, any farther designs of ambition.
 And yet a year had scarcely elapsed after the death of <PERSON>Maximin</PERSON> before the victorious emperors turned their arms against each other.
 The genius, the success, and the aspiring temper of Constantine, may seem to mark him out as the aggressor; but the perfidious character of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> justifies the most unfavourable suspicions, and by the faint light which history reflects on this transaction (86) we may discover a conspiracy fomented by his arts against the authority of his colleague.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had lately given his sister <PERSON>Anastasia</PERSON> in marriage to Bassianus, a man of a considerable family and fortune, and had elevated his new kinsman to the rank of Caesar.
 According to the system of government instituted by Diocletian, Italy, and perhaps Africa, were designed for his department in the empire.
 But the performance of the promised favour was either attended with so much delay, or accompanied with so many unequal conditions, that the fidelity of <PERSON>Bassianus</PERSON> was alienated rather than secured by the honourable distinction which he had obtained.
 His nomination had been ratified by the consent of Licinius; and that artful prince, by the means of his emissaries, soon contrived to enter into a secret and dangerous correspondence with the new Caesar, to irritate his discontents, and to urge him to the rash enterprise of extorting by violence what he might in vain solicit from the justice of Constantine.
 But the vigilant emperor discovered the conspiracy before it was ripe for execution; and, after solemnly renouncing the alliance of Bassianus, despoiled him of the purple, and inflicted the deserved punishment on his treason and ingratitude.
 The haughty refusal of Licinius, when he was required to deliver up the criminals who had taken refuge in his dominions, confirmed the suspicions already entertained of his perfidy; and the indignities offered at Almona, on the frontiers of Italy, to the statues of Constantine, became the signal of discord between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes.
 (87) <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> civil war between them.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> battle was fought near Cibalis, a city of Pannonia, situated on the river Save, about fifty miles above Sirmium.
 (88) From the inconsiderable forces which in this important contest <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> such powerful monarchs brought into the field, it may be inferred that the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> was suddenly provoked, and that the other was unexpectedly surprised.
 Battle of Cibalis.
 A.
D.
 315.
 8th OctThe emperor of the <LOC>West</LOC> had only twenty thousand, and the sovereign of the <LOC>East</LOC> no more than five-and-thirty thousand, men.
 The inferiority of number was, however, compensated by the advantage of the ground.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had taken post in a defile about <CARDINAL>half</CARDINAL> a mile in breadth, between a steep hill and a deep morass, and in that situation he steadily expected and repulsed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attack of the enemy.
 He pursued his success and advanced into the plain.
 But the veteran legions of <GPE>Illyricum</GPE> rallied under the standard of a leader who had been trained to arms in the school of <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> and Diocletian.
 The missile weapons on both sides were soon exhausted; the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies, with equal valour, rushed to a closer engagement of swords and spears, and the doubtful contest had already lasted from the dawn of the day to a late hour of the evening, when the right wing, which <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> led in person, made a vigorous and decisive charge.
 The judicious retreat of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> saved the remainder of his troops from a total defeat; but when he computed his loss, which amounted to more than twenty thousand men, he thought it unsafe to pass the <TIME>night</TIME> in the presence of an active and victorious enemy.
 Abandoning his camp and magazines, he marched away with secrecy and diligence at the head of the greatest part of his cavalry, and was soon removed beyond the danger of a pursuit.
 His diligence preserved his wife, his son, and his treasures, which he had deposited at Sirmium.
 <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> passed through that city, and, breaking down the bridge on the Save, hastened to collect a new army in <PRODUCT>Dacia</PRODUCT> and Thrace.
 In his flight he bestowed the precarious title of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> on Valens, his general of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> frontier.
 (89) Battle of <PERSON>Mardia</PERSON> The plain of <PERSON>Mardia</PERSON> in <LOC>Thrace</LOC> was the theatre of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> battle no less obstinate and bloody than the former.
 The troops on both sides displayed the same valour and discipline; and the victory was once more decided by the superior abilities of Constantine, who directed a body of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> thousand men to gain an advantageous height, from whence, during the heat of the action, they attacked the rear of the enemy, and made a very considerable slaughter.
 The troops of Licinius, however, presenting a double front, still maintained their ground till the approach of <TIME>night</TIME> put an end to the combat, and secured their retreat towards the mountains of Macedonia.
 (90) The loss of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles, and of his bravest veterans, reduced the fierce spirit of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> to sue for peace.
 His ambassador, Mistrianus, was admitted to the audience of Constantine: he expatiated on the common topics of moderation and humanity, which are so familiar to the eloquence of the vanquished; represented in the most insinuating language that the event of the war was still doubtful, whilst its inevitable calamities were alike pernicious to both the contending parties; and declared that he was authorised to propose a lasting and honourable peace in the name of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors his masters.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> received the mention of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> with indignation and contempt.
 It was necessary to accept this humiliating condition; and the unhappy Valens, after a reign of a few days, was deprived of the purple and of his life.
 As soon as this obstacle was removed, the tranquillity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world was easily restored.
 The successive defeats of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> had ruined his forces, but they had displayed his courage and abilities.
 His situation was almost desperate, but the efforts of despair are sometimes formidable, and the good sense of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> preferred a great and certain advantage to a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> trial of the chance of arms.
 Treaty of peace.
 DecemberHe consented to leave his rival, or, as he again styled Licinius, his friend and brother, in the possession of Thrace, <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, Syria, and Egypt; but the provinces of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Dacia, Macedonia, and <GPE>Greece</GPE> were yielded to the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, and the dominions of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> now extended from the confines of <GPE>Caledonia</GPE> to the extremity of Peloponnesus.
 It was stipulated by the same treaty that <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> royal youths, the sons of the emperors, should be called to the hopes of the succession.
 <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> and the young <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were soon afterwards declared <ORG>Caesars</ORG> in the West, while the younger <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> was invested with the same dignity in the East.
 In this double proportion of honours, the conqueror asserted the superiority of his arms and power.
 (92) General peace and laws of Constantine.
 A.
D.
 315-323 The reconciliation of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Licinius, though it was embittered by resentment and jealousy, by the remembrance of recent injuries, and by the apprehension of future dangers, maintained, however, above eight years, the tranquillity of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 As a very regular series of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> laws commences about this period, it would not be difficult to transcribe the civil regulations which employed the leisure of Constantine.
 But the most important of his institutions are intimately connected with the new system of policy and religion, which was not perfectly established till the last and peaceful <DATE>years</DATE> of his reign.
 There are many of his laws which, as far as they concern the rights of property of individuals, and the practice of the bar, are more properly referred to the private than to the public jurisprudence of the empire; and he published many edicts of so local and temporary a nature that they would ill deserve the notice of a general history.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> laws, however, may be selected from the crowd; the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> for its importance, the other for its singularity; the former for its remarkable benevolence, the latter for its excessive severity.
 1.
 The horrid practice, so familiar to the ancients, of exposing or murdering their newborn infants, was becoming every day more frequent in the provinces, and especially in Italy.
 It was the effect of distress; and the distress was principally occasioned by the intolerable burden of taxes, and by the vexatious as well as cruel prosecutions of the officers of the revenue against their insolvent debtors.
 The less opulent or less industrious part of mankind, instead of rejoicing in an increase of family deemed it an act of paternal tenderness to release their children from the impending miseries of a life which they themselves were unable to support.
 The humanity of Constantine, moved, perhaps, by some recent and extraordinary instances of despair, engaged him to address an edict to all the cities of Italy, and afterwards of Africa, directing immediate and sufficient relief to be given to those parents who should produce before the magistrates the children whom their own poverty would not allow them to educate.
 But the promise was too liberal, and the provision too vague, to effect any general or permanent benefit.
 (93) The law, though it may merit some praise, served rather to display than to alleviate the public distress.
 It still remains an authentic monument to contradict and confound those venal orators who were too well satisfied with their own situation to discover either vice or misery under the government of a generous sovereign.
 (94) 2.
 The laws of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> against rapes were dictated with very little indulgence for the most amiable weaknesses of human nature; since the description of that crime was applied not only to the brutal violence which compelled, but even to the gentle seduction which might persuade, an unmarried woman, under the age of twenty-five, to leave the house of her parents.
 The successful ravisher was punished with death; and as if simple death was inadequate to the enormity of his guilt, he was either burnt alive, or torn in pieces by wild beasts in the amphitheatre.
 The virgin's declaration that she had been carried away with her own consent, instead of saving her lover, exposed her to share his fate.
 The duty of a public prosecution was intrusted to the parents of the guilty or unfortunate maid; and if the sentiments of nature prevailed on them to dissemble the injury, and to repair by a subsequent marriage the honour of their family, they were themselves punished by exile and confiscation.
 The slaves, whether male or female, who were convicted of having been accessary to the rape or seduction, were burnt alive, or put to death by the ingenious torture of pouring down their throats a quantity of melted lead.
 As the crime was of a public kind, the accusation was permitted even to strangers.
 The commencement of the action was not limited to any term of years, and the consequences of the sentence were extended to the innocent offspring of such an irregular union.
 (95) But whenever the offence inspires less horror than the punishment, the rigour of penal law is obliged to give way to the common feelings of mankind.
 The most odious parts of this edict were softened or repealed in the subsequent reigns; (96) and even <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> himself very frequently alleviated, by partial acts of mercy, the stern temper of his general institutions.
 Such, indeed, was the singular humour of that emperor, who showed himself as indulgent, and even remiss, in the execution of his laws, as he was severe, and even cruel, in the enacting of them.
 It is scarcely possible to observe a more decisive symptom of weakness, either in the character of the prince, or in the constitution of the government.
 (97) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war.
 A.
D.
 322 The civil administration was sometimes interrupted by the military defence of the empire.
 Crispus, a youth of the most amiable character, who had received with the title of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> the command of the Rhine, distinguished his conduct as well as valour in several victories over the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and Alemanni, and taught the barbarians of that frontier to dread the eldest son of Constantine, and the grandson of Constantius.
 (98) The emperor himself had assumed the more difficult and important province of the Danube.
 The Goths, who in the time of <PERSON>Claudius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Aurelian</PERSON> had felt the weight of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms, respected the power of the empire, even in the midst of its intestine divisions.
 But the strength of that warlike nation was now restored by a peace of near fifty years; a new generation had arisen, who no longer remembered the misfortunes of ancient days: the <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> of the lake <PERSON>Maeotis</PERSON> followed the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> standard either as subjects or as allies, and their united force was poured upon the countries of Illyricum.
 Campona, Margus, and Bononia, appear to have been the scenes of several memorable sieges and battles; (99) and though <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> encountered a very obstinate resistance, he prevailed at length in the contest, and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were compelled to purchase an ignominious retreat by restoring the booty and prisoners which they had taken.
 Nor was this advantage sufficient to satisfy the indignation of the emperor.
 He resolved to chastise as well as to repulse the insolent barbarians who had dared to invade the territories of Rome.
 At the head of his legions he passed the Danube, after repairing the bridge which had been constructed by Trajan, penetrated into the strongest recesses of Dacia, (100) and, when he had inflicted a severe revenge, condescended to give peace to the suppliant Goths, on condition that, as often as they were required, they should supply his armies with a body of forty thousand soldiers.
 (101) Exploits like these were no doubt honourable to <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and beneficial to the state; but it may surely be questioned whether they can justify the exaggerated assertion of Eusebius, that ALL SCYTHIA, as far as the extremity of the North, divided as it was into so many names and nations of the most various and savage manners, had been added by his victorious arms to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (102) <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> civil war between <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Licinius.
 A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>323</CARDINAL> In this exalted state of glory it was impossible that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> should any longer endure a partner in the empire.
 Confiding in the superiority of his genius and military power, he determined, without any previous injury, to exert them for the destruction of Licinius, whose advanced age and unpopular vices seemed to offer a very easy conquest.
 (103) But the old emperor, awakened by the approaching danger, deceived the expectations of his friends as well as of his enemies.
 Calling forth that spirit and those abilities by which he had deserved the friend ship of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> purple, he prepared himself for the contest, collected the forces of the East, and soon filled the plains of <PERSON>Hadrianople</PERSON> with his troops, and the Straits of the <PRODUCT>Hellespont</PRODUCT> with his fleet.
 The army consisted of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and fifty thousand foot and fifteen thousand horse, and as the cavalry was drawn, for the most part, from <GPE>Phrygia</GPE> and Cappadocia, we may conceive a more favourable opinion of the beauty of the horses than of the courage and dexterity of their riders.
 The fleet was composed of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred and fifty galleys of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ranks of oars.
 An hundred and thirty of these were furnished by <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and the adjacent coast of Africa.
 An hundred and ten sailed from the ports of <GPE>Phoenicia</GPE> and the isle of Cyprus; and the maritime countries of Bithynia, Ionia, and <GPE>Caria</GPE> were likewise obliged to provide an hundred and ten galleys.
 The troops of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were ordered to rendezvous at Thessalonica; they amounted to above an hundred and twenty thousand horse and foot.
 (104) Their emperor was satisfied with their martial appearance, and his army contained more soldiers, though fewer men, than that of his eastern competitor.
 The legions of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were levied in the warlike provinces of Europe; action had confirmed their discipline, victory had elevated their hopes, and there were among them a great number of veterans, who, after <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> glorious campaigns under the same leader, prepared themselves to deserve an honourable dismission by a last effort of their valour.
 (105) But the naval preparations of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were in every respect much inferior to those of Licinius.
 The maritime cities of <GPE>Greece</GPE> sent their respective quotas of men and ships to the celebrated harbour of <GPE>Piraeus</GPE> and their united forces consisted of no more than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred small vessels; a very feeble armament, if it is compared with those formidable fleets which were equipped and maintained by the republic of <GPE>Athens</GPE> during the Peloponnesian war.
 (106) Since <GPE>Italy</GPE> was no longer the seat of government, the naval establishments of <GPE>Misenum</GPE> and <GPE>Ravenna</GPE> had been gradually neglected; and as the shipping and mariners of the empire were supported by commerce rather than by war, it was natural that they should the most abound in the industrious provinces of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Asia.
 It is only surprising that the eastern emperor, who possessed so great a superiority at sea, should have neglected the opportunity of carrying an offensive war into the centre of his rival's dominions.
 Battle of Hadrianople.
 A.
D.
 323.
 July 3.
 Instead of embracing such an active resolution, which might have changed the whole face of the war, the prudent <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> expected the approach of his rival in a camp near Hadrianople, which he had fortified with an anxious care that betrayed his apprehension of the event.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> directed his march from <GPE>Thessallica</GPE> towards that part of Thrace, till he found himself stopped by the broad and rapid stream of the Hebrus, and discovered the numerous army of Licinius, which filled the steep ascent of the hill, from the river to the city of Hadrianople.
 Many days were spent in doubtful and distant skirmishes; but at length the obstacles of the passage and of the attack were removed by the intrepid conduct of Constantine.
 In this place we might relate a wonderful exploit of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> which, though it can scarcely be paralleled either in poetry or romance, is celebrated, not by a venal orator devoted to his fortune, but by an historian, the partial enemy of his fame.
 We are assured that the valiant emperor threw himself into the river <GPE>Hebrus</GPE> accompanied only by <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> horsemen, and that by the effort or terror of his invincible arm, he broke, slaughtered, and put to flight a host of an hundred and fifty thousand men.
 The credulity of <PERSON>Zosimus</PERSON> prevailed so strongly over his passion that, among the events of the memorable battle of Hadrianople, he seems to have selected and embellished, not the most important, but the most marvellous.
 The valour and danger of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> are attested by a slight wound which he received in the thigh; but it may be discovered, even from an imperfect narration, and perhaps a corrupted text, that the victory was obtained no less by the conduct of the general than by the courage of the hero; that a body of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> thousand archers marched round to occupy a thick wood in the rear of the enemy, whose attention was diverted by the construction of a bridge; and that Licinius, perplexed by so many artful evolutions, was reluctantly drawn from his advantageous post to combat on equal ground in the plain.
 The contest was no longer equal.
 His confused multitude of new levies was easily vanquished by the experienced veterans of the West.
 Thirty-four thousand men are reported to have been slain.
 The fortified camp of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> was taken by assault the evening of the battle; the greater part of the fugitives, who had retired to the mountains, surrendered themselves the next day to the discretion of the conqueror; and his rival, who could no longer keep the field, confined himself within the walls of Byzantium.
 (107) Siege of Byzantium, and naval victory of <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> The siege of Byzantium, which was immediately undertaken by Constantine, was attended with great labour and uncertainty.
 In the late civil wars, the fortifications of that place, so justly considered as the key of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, had been repaired and strengthened; and as long as <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> remained master of the sea, the garrison was much less exposed to the danger of famine than the army of the besiegers.
 The naval commanders of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were summoned to his camp, and received his positive orders to force the passage of the Hellespont, as the fleet of Licinius, instead of seeking and destroying their feeble enemy, continued inactive in those narrow straits, where its superiority of numbers was of little use or advantage.
 Crispus, the emperor's eldest son, was intrusted with the execution of this daring enterprise, which he performed with so much courage and success, that he deserved the esteem, and most probably excited the jealousy, of his father.
 The engagement lasted <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days; and in the evening of the first, the contending fleets, after a considerable and mutual loss, retired into their respective harbours of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day about noon a strong south wind (108) sprang up, which carried the vessels of <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> against the enemy; and as the casual advantage was improved by his skilful intrepidity, he soon obtained a complete victory.
 An hundred and thirty vessels were destroyed, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> thousand men were slain, and Amandus, the admiral of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> fleet, escaped with the utmost difficulty to the shores of Chalcedon.
 As soon as the <PRODUCT>Hellespont</PRODUCT> was open, a plentiful convoy of provisions flowed into the camp of Constantine, who had already advanced the operations of the siege.
 He constructed artificial mounds of earth of an equal height with the ramparts of Byzantium.
 The lofty towers which were erected on that foundation galled the besieged with large stones and darts from the military engines, and the battering rams had shaken the walls in several places.
 If <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> persisted much longer in the defence, he exposed himself to be involved in the ruin of the place.
 Before he was surrounded, he prudently removed his person and treasures to <GPE>Chalcedon</GPE> in Asia; and as he was always desirous of associating companions to the hopes and dangers of his fortune, he now bestowed the title of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> on Martinianus, who exercised <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most important offices of the empire.
 (109) Battle of <GPE>Chrysopolis</GPE> Such were still the resources, and such the abilities, of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> that, after so many successive defeats, he collected in <GPE>Bithynia</GPE> a new army of fifty or sixty thousand men, while the activity of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was employed in the siege of Byzantium.
 The vigilant emperor did not, however, neglect the last struggles of his antagonist.
 A considerable part of his victorious army was transported over the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> in small vessels, and the decisive engagement was fought soon after their landing on the heights of Chrysopolis, or, as it is now called, of Scutari.
 The troops of Licinius, though they were lately raised, ill armed, and worse disciplined, made head against their conquerors with fruitless but desperate valour, till a total defeat, and the slaughter of five-and-twenty thousand men, irretrievably determined the fate of their leader.
 (110)Submission and death of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> He retired to Nicomedia, rather with the view of gaining some time for negotiation than with the hope of any effectual defence.
 Constantia, his wife, and the sister of Constantine, interceded with her brother in favour of her husband, and obtained from his policy, rather than from his compassion, a solemn promise, confirmed by an oath, that after the sacrifice of Martinianus, and the resignation of the purple, <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> himself should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in peace and affluence.
 The behaviour of Constantia, and her relation to the contending parties, naturally recalls the remembrance of that virtuous matron who was the sister of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and the wife of Antony.
 But the temper of mankind was altered, and it was no longer esteemed infamous for a <NORP>Roman</NORP> to survive his honour and independence.
 <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> solicited and accepted the pardon of his offences, laid himself and his purple at the feet of his lord and master, was raised from the ground with insulting pity, was admitted the same day to the imperial banquet, and soon afterwards was sent away to Thessalonica, which had been chosen for the place of his confinement.
 (111) His confinement was soon terminated by death, and it is doubtful whether a tumult of the soldiers, or a decree of the senate, was suggested as the motive for his execution.
 According to the rules of tyranny, he was accused of forming a conspiracy, and of holding a treasonable correspondence with the barbarians; but as he was never convicted, either by his own conduct or by any legal evidence, we may perhaps be allowed, from his weakness, to presume his innocence.
 (112) The memory of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> was branded with infamy, his statues were thrown down, and by a hasty edict, of such mischievous tendency that it was almost immediately corrected, all his laws and all the judicial proceedings of his reign were at once abolished.
 (113) Re-union of the empire.
 A.
D.
 324 By this victory of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world was again united under the authority of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> emperor, thirty-seven <DATE>years</DATE> after <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> had divided his power and provinces with his associate Maximian.
 The successive steps of the elevation of Constantine, from his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assuming the purple at York, to the resignation of <PERSON>Licinius</PERSON> at Nicomedia, have been related with some minuteness and precision, not only as the events are in themselves both interesting and important, but still more as they contributed to the decline of the empire by the expense of blood and treasure, and by the perpetual increase, as well of the taxes as of the military establishment.
 The foundation of Constantinople, and the establishment of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion, were the immediate and memorable consequences of this revolution.
