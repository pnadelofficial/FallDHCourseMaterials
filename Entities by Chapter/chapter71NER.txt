 Conclusion of the Whole Work.
 View and discourse of <NORP>Poggius</NORP> from the <NORP>Capitoline</NORP> hill, A.
D.
 1430 In the last days of Pope <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> the Fourth, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of his servants, the learned <NORP>Poggius</NORP> (1) and a friend, ascended the <NORP>Capitoline</NORP> hill; reposed themselves among the ruins of columns and temples; and viewed from that commanding spot the wide and various prospect of desolation.
 (2) The place and the object gave ample scope for moralizing on the vicissitudes of fortune, which spares neither man nor the proudest of his works, which buries empires and cities in a common grave; and it was agreed, that in proportion to her former greatness, the fall of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was the more awful and deplorable.
 His description of the ruins These relics are minutely described by Poggius, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> who raised his eyes from the monuments of legendary, to those of classic, superstition.
 (5) 1.
 Besides a bridge, an arch, a sepulchre, and the pyramid of Cestius, he could discern, of the age of the republic, a double row of vaults, in the salt-office of the Capitol, which were inscribed with the name and munificence of Catulus.
 2.
 <CARDINAL>Eleven</CARDINAL> temples were visible in some degree, from the perfect form of the Pantheon, to the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> arches and a marble column of the temple of Peace, which <NORP>Vespasian</NORP> erected after the civil wars and the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> triumph.
 3.
 Of the number, which he rashly defines, of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thermae, or public baths, none were sufficiently entire to represent the use and distribution of the several parts: but those of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and Antoninus Caracalla still retained the titles of the founders, and astonished the curious spectator, who, in observing their solidity and extent, the variety of marbles, the size and multitude of the columns, compared the labor and expense with the use and importance.
 Of the baths of Constantine, of Alexander, of Domitian, or rather of Titus, some vestige might yet be found.
 4.
 The triumphal arches of Titus, Severus, and Constantine, were entire, both the structure and the inscriptions; a falling fragment was honoured with the name of Trajan; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> arches, then extant, in the <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> way, have been ascribed to the baser memory of <PERSON>Faustina</PERSON> and Gallienus.
 5.
 After the wonder of the Coliseum, <NORP>Poggius</NORP> might have overlooked small amphitheatre of brick, most probably for the use of the praetorian camp: the theatres of <PERSON>Marcellus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> were occupied in a great measure by public and private buildings; and in the Circus, <PERSON>Agonalis</PERSON> and Maximus, little more than the situation and the form could be investigated.
 6.
 The columns of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Antonine</PERSON> were still erect; but the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> obelisks were broken or buried.
 A people of gods and heroes, the workmanship of art, was reduced to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> equestrian figure of gilt brass, and to <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> marble statues, of which the most conspicuous were the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> horses of <NORP>Phidias</NORP> and Praxiteles.
 7.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> mausoleums or sepulchres of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> could not totally be lost: but the former was only visible as a mound of earth; and the latter, the castle of St.
 Angelo, had acquired the name and appearance of a modern fortress.
 With the addition of some separate and nameless columns, such were the remains of the ancient city; for the marks of a more recent structure might be detected in the walls, which formed a circumference of ten miles, included <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred and seventy-nine turrets, and opened into the country by <CARDINAL>thirteen</CARDINAL> gates.
Gradual decay of Rome.
 This melancholy picture was drawn above <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> hundred years after the fall of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire, and even of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kingdom of Italy.
 A long period of distress and anarchy, in which empire, and arts, and riches had migrated from the banks of the Tyber, was incapable of restoring or adorning the city; and, as all that is human must retrograde if it do not advance, every successive age must have hastened the ruin of the works of antiquity.
 To measure the progress of decay, and to ascertain, at each aera, the state of each edifice, would be an endless and a useless labor; and I shall content myself with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> observations, which will introduce a short inquiry into the general causes and effects.
 1.
 Two hundred years before the eloquent complaint of Poggius, an anonymous writer composed a description of Rome.
 (6) His ignorance may repeat the same objects under strange and fabulous names.
 Yet this barbarous topographer had eyes and ears; he could observe the visible remains; he could listen to the tradition of the people; and he distinctly enumerates <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> theatres, <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> baths, <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> arches, and <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> palaces, of which many had disappeared before the time of Poggius.
 It is apparent, that many stately monuments of antiquity survived till a late period, (7) and that the principles of destruction acted with vigorous and increasing energy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.
 2.
 The same reflection must be applied to the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> last ages; and we should vainly seek the Septizonium of Severus; (8) which is celebrated by <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> and the antiquarians of the sixteenth century.
 While the <NORP>Roman</NORP> edifices were still entire, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> blows, however weighty and impetuous, were resisted by the solidity of the mass and the harmony of the parts; but the slightest touch would precipitate the fragments of arches and columns, that already nodded to their fall.
 <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> causes of destruction: After a diligent inquiry, I can discern <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> principal causes of the ruin of Rome, which continued to operate in a period of more than a thousand years.
 I.
 The injuries of time and nature.
 II.
 The hostile attacks of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> and Christians.
 III.
 The use and abuse of the materials.
 And, IV.
 The domestic quarrels of the Romans.
 The <ORG>Coliseum</ORG> or amphitheatre of <PERSON>Titus</PERSON> These general observations may be separately applied to the amphitheatre of Titus, which has obtained the name of the COLISEUM, (49) either from its magnitude, or from Nero's colossal statue; an edifice, had it been left to time and nature, which might perhaps have claimed an eternal duration.
 The curious antiquaries, who have computed the numbers and seats, are disposed to believe, that above the upper row of stone steps the amphitheatre was encircled and elevated with several stages of wooden galleries, which were repeatedly consumed by fire, and restored by the emperors.
 Whatever was precious, or portable, or profane, the statues of gods and heroes, and the costly ornaments of sculpture which were cast in brass, or overspread with leaves of silver and gold, became the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> prey of conquest or fanaticism, of the avarice of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> or the Christians.
 In the massy stones of the Coliseum, many holes are discerned; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most probable conjectures represent the various accidents of its decay.
 These stones were connected by solid links of brass or iron, nor had the eye of rapine overlooked the value of the baser metals; (50) the vacant space was converted into a fair or market; the artisans of the <ORG>Coliseum</ORG> are mentioned in an ancient survey; and the chasms were perforated or enlarged to receive the poles that supported the shops or tents of the mechanic trades.
 (51) Reduced to its naked majesty, the <NORP>Flavian</NORP> amphitheatre was contemplated with awe and admiration by the pilgrims of the North; and their rude enthusiasm broke forth in a sublime proverbial expression, which is recorded in the eighth century, in the fragments of the venerable Bede: In the modern system of war, a situation commanded by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hills would not be chosen for a fortress; but the strength of the walls and arches could resist the engines of assault; a numerous garrison might be lodged in the enclosure; and while <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> faction occupied the <FAC>Vatican</FAC> and the Capitol, the other was entrenched in the <LOC>Lateran</LOC> and the Coliseum.
 (53)Games of Rome.
 The abolition at <GPE>Rome</GPE> of the ancient games must be understood with some latitude; and the carnival sports, of the <NORP>Testacean</NORP> mount and the <FAC>Circus</FAC> Agonalis, (54) were regulated by the law (55) or custom of the city.
 The senator presided with dignity and pomp to adjudge and distribute the prizes, the gold ring, or the pallium, (56) as it was styled, of cloth or silk.
 A tribute on the <NORP>Jews</NORP> supplied the <DATE>annual</DATE> expense; (57) and the races, on foot, on horseback, or in chariots, were ennobled by a tilt and tournament of <CARDINAL>seventy-two</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> youth.
 A bull-feast in the Coliseum, (A.
D.
 1332, September 3.
) In the year <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred and thirty-two, a bull-feast, after the fashion of the <NORP>Moors</NORP> and Spaniards, was celebrated in the <ORG>Coliseum</ORG> itself; and the living manners are painted in a diary of the times.
 (58) A convenient order of benches was restored; and a general proclamation, as far as <GPE>Rimini</GPE> and Ravenna, invited the nobles to exercise their skill and courage in this perilous adventure.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> ladies were marshalled in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> squadrons, and seated in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> balconies, which, on this day, the third of September, were lined with scarlet cloth.
 The fair Jacova di Rovere led the matrons from beyond the Tyber, a pure and native race, who still represent the features and character of antiquity.
 The remainder of the city was divided as usual between the <NORP>Colonna</NORP> and Ursini: the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions were proud of the number and beauty of their female bands: the charms of Savella <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> are mentioned with praise; and the <NORP>Colonna</NORP> regretted the absence of the youngest of their house, who had sprained her ankle in the garden of Nero's tower.
 The lots of the champions were drawn by an old and respectable citizen; and they descended into the arena, or pit, to encounter the wild bulls, on foot as it should seem, with a single spear.
 Amidst the crowd, our annalist has selected the names, colours, and devices, of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> of the most conspicuous knights.
 Several of the names are the most illustrious of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the ecclesiastical state: Malatesta, Polenta, della Valle, Cafarello, Savelli, Capoccio, Conti, Annibaldi, Altieri, Corsi: the colours were adapted to their taste and situation; the devices are expressive of hope or despair, and breathe the spirit of gallantry and arms.
 "I am alone, like the youngest of the Horatii," the confidence of an intrepid stranger: "I live disconsolate," a weeping widower: "I burn under the ashes," a discreet lover: "I adore Lavinia, or Lucretia," the ambiguous declaration of a modern passion: "My faith is as pure," the motto of a white livery: "Who is stronger than myself?" of a lion's hide: "If am drowned in blood, what a pleasant death!" the wish of ferocious courage.
 The pride or prudence of the <PERSON>Ursini</PERSON> restrained them from the field, which was occupied by <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> of their hereditary rivals, whose inscriptions denoted the lofty greatness of the <NORP>Colonna</NORP> name: — intimating (says the contemporary writer) that while the other families were the subjects of the Vatican, they alone were the supporters of the Capitol.
 The combats of the amphitheatre were dangerous and bloody.
 Every champion successively encountered a wild bull; and the victory may be ascribed to the quadrupeds, since no more than <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> were left on the field, with the loss of <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> wounded and <CARDINAL>eighteen</CARDINAL> killed on the side of their adversaries.
 Some of the noblest families might mourn, but the pomp of the funerals, in the churches of St.
 John <LOC>Lateran</LOC> and St.
 Maria Maggiore, afforded a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> holiday to the people.
 Doubtless it was not in such conflicts that the blood of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> should have been shed; yet, in blaming their rashness, we are compelled to applaud their gallantry; and the noble volunteers, who display their magnificence, and risk their lives, under the balconies of the fair, excite a more generous sympathy than the <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of captives and malefactors who were reluctantly dragged to the scene of slaughter.
 (59)Injuries, This use of the amphitheatre was a rare, perhaps a singular, festival: the demand for the materials was a daily and continual want which the citizens could gratify without restraint or remorse.
 In the fourteenth century, a scandalous act of concord secured to both factions the privilege of extracting stones from the free and common quarry of the Coliseum; (60) and <NORP>Poggius</NORP> laments, that the greater part of these stones had been burnt to lime by the folly of the Romans.
 (61) To check this abuse, and to prevent the nocturnal crimes that might be perpetrated in the vast and gloomy recess, <PERSON>Eugenius</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fourth</ORDINAL> surrounded it with a wall; and, by a charter long extant, granted both the ground and edifice to the monks of an adjacent convent.
 (62) After his death, the wall was overthrown in a tumult of the people; and had they themselves respected the noblest monument of their fathers, they might have justified the resolve that it should never be degraded to private property.
 The inside was damaged: but in the middle of the sixteenth century, an aera of taste and learning, the exterior circumference of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> thousand six hundred and <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> feet was still entire and inviolate; a triple elevation of fourscore arches, which rose to the height of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and eight feet.
 Of the present ruin, the nephews of <PERSON>Paul</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> are the guilty agents; and consecration of the <ORG>Coliseum</ORG> and every traveller who views the <PERSON>Farnese</PERSON> palace may curse the sacrilege and luxury of these upstart princes.
 (63) A similar reproach is applied to the Barberini; and the repetition of injury might be dreaded from every reign, till the <ORG>Coliseum</ORG> was placed under the safeguard of religion by the most liberal of the pontiffs, Benedict the Fourteenth, who consecrated a spot which persecution and fable had stained with the blood of so many <NORP>Christian</NORP> martyrs.
 (64)Ignorance and barbarism of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> When <PERSON>Petrarch</PERSON> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> gratified his eyes with a view of those monuments, whose scattered fragments so far surpass the most eloquent descriptions, he was astonished at the supine indifference (65) of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> themselves; (66) he was humbled rather than elated by the discovery, that, except his friend Rienzi, and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the Colonna, a stranger of the <LOC>Rhone</LOC> was more conversant with these antiquities than the nobles and natives of the metropolis.
 (67) The ignorance and credulity of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> are elaborately displayed in the old survey of the city which was composed about the beginning of the thirteenth century; and, without dwelling on the manifold errors of name and place, the legend of the <ORG>Capitol</ORG> (68) may provoke a smile of contempt and indignation.
 A <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> example, of less importance, though of equal absurdity, may be drawn from the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> marble horses, led by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> naked youths, who have since been transported from the baths of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to the Quirinal hill.
 The groundless application of the names of <NORP>Phidias</NORP> and <PERSON>Praxiteles</PERSON> may perhaps be excused; but these <NORP>Grecian</NORP> sculptors should not have been removed above <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> hundred years from the age of <PERSON>Pericles</PERSON> to that of Tiberius; they should not have been transferred into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> philosophers or magicians, whose nakedness was the symbol of truth or knowledge, who revealed to the emperor his most secret actions; and, after refusing all pecuniary recompense, solicited the honour of leaving this eternal monument of themselves.
 (70) Thus awake to the power of magic, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were insensible to the beauties of art: no more than <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> statues were visible to the eyes of Poggius; and of the multitudes which chance or design had buried under the ruins, the resurrection was fortunately delayed till a safer and more enlightened age.
 (71) The <LOC>Nile</LOC> which now adorns the Vatican, had been explored by some labourers in digging a vineyard near the temple, or convent, of the Minerva; but the impatient proprietor, who was tormented by some visits of curiosity, restored the unprofitable marble to its former grave.
 (72) The discovery of a statue of Pompey, ten feet in length, was the occasion of a lawsuit.
 It had been found under a partition wall: the equitable judge had pronounced, that the head should be separated from the body to satisfy the claims of the contiguous owners; and the sentence would have been executed, if the intercession of a cardinal, and the liberality of a pope, had not rescued the <NORP>Roman</NORP> hero from the hands of his barbarous countrymen.
 (73)Restoration and ornaments of the city, A.
D.
 1420 etc.
 But the clouds of barbarism were gradually dispelled; and the peaceful authority of Martin the Fifth and his successors restored the ornaments of the city as well as the order of the ecclesiastical state.
 The improvements of Rome, since the fifteenth century, have not been the spontaneous produce of freedom and industry.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most natural root of a great city is the labor and populousness of the adjacent country, which supplies the materials of subsistence, of manufactures, and of foreign trade.
 But the greater part of the <GPE>Campagna</GPE> of <GPE>Rome</GPE> is reduced to a dreary and desolate wilderness: the overgrown estates of the princes and the clergy are cultivated by the lazy hands of indigent and hopeless vassals; and the scanty harvests are confined or exported for the benefit of a monopoly.
 A <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and more artificial cause of the growth of a metropolis is the residence of a monarch, the expense of a luxurious court, and the tributes of dependent provinces.
 Those provinces and tributes had been lost in the fall of the empire; and if some streams of the silver of <GPE>Peru</GPE> and the gold of <GPE>Brazil</GPE> have been attracted by the Vatican, the revenues of the cardinals, the fees of office, the oblations of pilgrims and clients, and the remnant of ecclesiastical taxes, afford a poor and precarious supply, which maintains, however, the idleness of the court and city.
 The population of Rome, far below the measure of the great capitals of Europe, does not exceed <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants; (74) and within the spacious enclosure of the walls, the largest portion of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hills is overspread with vineyards and ruins.
 The beauty and splendour of the modern city may be ascribed to the abuses of the government, to the influence of superstition.
 Each reign (the exceptions are rare) has been marked by the rapid elevation of a new family, enriched by the childish pontiff at the expense of the church and country.
 The palaces of these fortunate nephews are the most costly monuments of elegance and servitude: the perfect arts of architecture, sculpture, and painting, have been prostituted in their service; and their galleries and gardens are decorated with the most precious works of antiquity, which taste or vanity has prompted them to collect.
 The ecclesiastical revenues were more decently employed by the popes themselves in the pomp of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> worship; but it is superfluous to enumerate their pious foundations of altars, chapels, and churches, since these lesser stars are eclipsed by the sun of the Vatican, by the dome of St.
 Peter, the most glorious structure that ever has been applied to the use of religion.
 The fame of Julius the Second, Leo the Tenth, and Sixtus the Fifth, is accompanied by the superior merit of <PERSON>Bramante</PERSON> and Fontana, of <PERSON>Raphael</PERSON> and Michael Angelo; and the same munificence which had been displayed in palaces and temples was directed with equal zeal to revive and emulate the labours of antiquity.
 Prostrate obelisks were raised from the ground, and erected in the most conspicuous places; of the <CARDINAL>eleven</CARDINAL> aqueducts of the <PERSON>Caesars</PERSON> and consuls, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> were restored; the artificial rivers were conducted over a long series of old, or of new arches, to discharge into marble basins a flood of salubrious and refreshing waters: and the spectator, impatient to ascend the steps of St.
 Peter's, is detained by a column of <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> granite, which rises between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> lofty and perpetual fountains, to the height of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> feet.
 The map, the description, the monuments of ancient Rome, have been elucidated by the diligence of the antiquarian and the student: (75) and the footsteps of heroes, the relics, not of superstition, but of empire, are devoutly visited by a new race of pilgrims from the remote, and once savage countries of the North.
 Final Conclusion Of these pilgrims, and of every reader, the attention will be excited by a History of the Decline and Fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> Empire; the greatest, perhaps, and most awful scene in the history of mankind.
 The various causes and progressive effects are connected with many of the events most interesting in human annals: the artful policy of the Caesars, who long maintained the name and image of a free republic; the disorders of military despotism; the rise, establishment, and sects of Christianity; the foundation of Constantinople; the division of the monarchy; the invasion and settlements of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia; the institutions of the civil law; the character and religion of Mahomet; the temporal sovereignty of the popes; the restoration and decay of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire of Charlemagne; the crusades of the <NORP>Latins</NORP> in the East: the conquests of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> and Turks; the ruin of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire; the state and revolutions of <GPE>Rome</GPE> in the middle age.
 The historian may applaud the importance and variety of his subject; but while he is conscious of his own imperfections, he must often accuse the deficiency of his materials.
 It was among the ruins of the <ORG>Capitol</ORG> that I <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> conceived the idea of a work which has amused and exercised near <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years of my life, and which, however inadequate to my own wishes, I finally delivered to the curiosity and candour of the public.
