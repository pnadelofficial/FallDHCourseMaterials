Character of Constantine— <NORP>Gothic</NORP> War—Death of Constantine— Division of the Empire among His <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> Sons— <NORP>Persian</NORP> War— Tragic Deaths of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the Younger and Constans— Usurpation of Magnentius— Civil War— Victory of Constantius.
Character of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> THE character of the prince who removed the seat of empire, and introduced such important changes into the civil and religious constitution of his country, has fixed the attention, and divided the opinions of mankind By the grateful zeal of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> the deliverer of the church has been decorated with every attribute of a hero, and even of a saint; while the discontent of the vanquished party has compared <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to the most abhorred of those tyrants who, by their vice and weakness, dishonoured the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> purple.
 The same passions have, in some degree, been perpetuated to succeeding generations, and the character of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> is considered, even in the present age, as an object either of satire or of panegyric.
 By the impartial union of those defects which are confessed by his warmest admirers, and of those virtues which are acknowledged by his most implacable enemies, we might hope to delineate a just portrait of that extraordinary man, which the truth and candour of history should adopt without a blush.
(1) But it would soon appear that the vain attempt to blend such discordant colours, and to reconcile such inconsistent qualities, must produce a figure monstrous rather than human, unless it is viewed in its proper and distinct lights by a careful separation of the different periods of the reign of Constantine.
 His virtues The person, as well as the mind, of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had been enriched by nature with her choicest endowments.
 His stature was lofty, his countenance majestic, his deportment graceful; his strength and activity were displayed in every manly exercise, and, from his earliest youth to a very advanced season of life, he preserved the vigour of his constitution by a strict adherence to the domestic virtues of chastity and of temperance.
 He delighted in the social intercourse of familiar conversation; and though he might sometimes indulge his disposition to raillery with less reserve than was required by the severe dignity of his station, the courtesy and liberality of his manners gained the hearts of all who approached him.
 The sincerity of his friendship has been suspected; yet he showed, on some occasions, that he was not incapable of a warm and lasting attachment.
 The disadvantage of an illiterate education had not prevented him from forming a just estimate of the value of learning; and the arts and sciences derived some encouragement from the munificent protection of Constantine.
 In the despatch of business his diligence was indefatigable; and the active powers of his mind were almost continually exercised in reading, writing, or meditating, in giving audience to ambassadors, and in examining the complaints of his subjects.
 Even those who censured the propriety of his measures were compelled to acknowledge that he possessed magnanimity to conceive, and patience to execute, the most arduous designs, without being checked either by the prejudices of education or by the clamours of the multitude.
 In the field he infused his own intrepid spirit into the troops, whom he conducted with the talents of a consummate general; and to his abilities, rather than to his fortune, we may ascribe the signal victories which he obtained over the foreign and domestic foes of the republic.
 He loved glory as the reward, perhaps as the motive, of his labours.
 The boundless ambition which, from the moment of his accepting the purple at York, appears as the ruling passion of his soul, may be justified by the dangers of his own situation, by the character of his rivals, by the consciousness of superior merit, and by the prospect that his success would enable him to restore peace and order to the distracted empire.
 In his civil wars against <LOC>Maxentius</LOC> and <PRODUCT>Licinius</PRODUCT> he had engaged on his side the inclinations of the people, who compared the undissembled vices of those tyrants with the spirit of wisdom and justice which seemed to direct the general tenor of the administration of Constantine.
(2) His vices Had <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> fallen on the banks of the Tiber.
 or even in the plains of Hadrianople, such is the character which, with a few exceptions he might have transmitted to posterity.
 But the conclusion of his reign (according to the moderate and indeed tender sentence of a writer of the same age) degraded him from the rank which he had acquired among the most deserving of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes.
(3) In the life of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> we behold the tyrant of the republic converted almost by imperceptible degrees into the father of his country and of human kind.
 In that of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> we may contemplate a hero, who had so long inspired his subjects with love and his enemies with terror, degenerating into a cruel and dissolute monarch, corrupted by his fortune, or raised by conquest above the necessity of dissimulation.
 The general peace which he maintained during the last fourteen <DATE>years</DATE> of his A.
D.
 323-337 reign was a period of apparent splendour rather than of real prosperity; and the old age of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was disgraced by the opposite yet reconcilable vices of rapaciousness and prodigality.
 The accumulated treasures found in the palaces of <LOC>Maxentius</LOC> and <PRODUCT>Licinius</PRODUCT> were lavishly consumed; the various innovations introduced by the conqueror were attended with an increasing expense, the cost of his buildings, his court, and his festivals required an immediate and plentiful supply; and the oppression of the people was the only fund which could support the magnificence of the sovereign.
 (4) His unworthy favourites, enriched by the boundless liberality of their master, usurped with impunity the privilege of rapine and corruption.
(5) A secret but universal decay was felt in every part of the public administration, and the emperor himself, though he still retained the obedience, gradually lost the esteem, of his subjects.
 The dress and manners which, towards the decline of life, he chose to effect, served only to degrade him in the eyes of mankind.
 The <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> pomp which had been adopted by the pride of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> assumed an air of softness and effeminacy in the person of Constantine.
 He is represented with false hair of various colours, laboriously arranged by the skilful artists of the times; a diadem of a new and more expensive fashion; a profusion of gems and pearls, of collars and bracelets; and a variegated flowing robe of silk, most curiously embroidered with flowers of gold.
 In such apparel, scarcely to be excused by the youth and folly of Elagabalus, we are at a loss to discover the wisdom of an aged monarch and the simplicity of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> veteran.
 (6) A mind thus relaxed by prosperity and indulgence was incapable of rising to that magnanimity which disdains suspicion and dares to forgive.
 The deaths of <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> and <PRODUCT>Licinius</PRODUCT> may perhaps be justified by the maxims of policy as they are taught in the schools of tyrants; but an impartial narrative of the executions, or rather murders, which sullied the declining age of Constantine, will suggest to our most candid thoughts the idea of a prince who could sacrifice, without reluctance, the laws of justice and the feelings of nature to the dictates either of his passions or of his interest.
 His family The same fortune which so invariably followed the standard of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> seemed to secure the hopes and comforts of his domestic life.
 Those among his predecessors who had enjoyed the longest and most prosperous reigns, Augustus, Trajan, and Diocletian, had been disappointed of posterity; and the frequent revolutions had never allowed sufficient time for any imperial family to grow up and multiply under the shade of the purple.
 But the royalty of the <NORP>Flavian</NORP> line, which had been <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ennobled by the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Claudius, descended through several generations; and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> himself derived from his royal father the hereditary honours which he transmitted to his children.
 The emperor had been twice married.
 Minervina, the obscure but lawful object of his youthful attachment, (7) had left him only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> son, who was called Crispus.
 By Fausta, the daughter of Maximian, he had <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> daughters, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons known by the kindred names of Constantine, Constantius, and Constans.
 The unambitious brothers of the Great Constantine, <PERSON>Julius</PERSON> Constantius, Dalmatius, and Hannibalanus, (8) were permitted to enjoy the most honourable rank and the most affluent fortune that could be consistent with a private station.
 The youngest of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> lived without a name and did without posterity.
 His <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> elder brothers obtained in marriage the daughters of wealthy senators, and propagated new branches of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> race.
 <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> afterwards became the most illustrious of the children of <PERSON>Julius</PERSON> Constantius, the Patrician.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons of Dalmatius, who had been decorated with the vain title of Censor, were named <PERSON>Dalmatius</PERSON> and Hannibalianus.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sisters of the great Constantine, <PERSON>Anastasia</PERSON> and Eutropia, were bestowed on <NORP>Optatus</NORP> and Nepotianus, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> senators of noble birth and of consular dignity.
 His <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> sister, Constantia, was distinguished by her pre-eminence of greatness and of misery.
 She remained the widow of the vanquished Licinius; and it was by her entreaties that an innocent boy, the offspring of their marriage, preserved, for sometime, his life, the title of Caesar, and a precarious hope of the succession.
 Besides the females and the allies of the <NORP>Flavian</NORP> house, ten or twelve males, to whom the language of modern courts would apply the title of princes of the blood, seemed, according to the order of their birth, to be destined either to inherit or to support the throne of Constantine.
 But in less than thirty <DATE>years</DATE> this numerous and increasing family was reduced to the persons of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> and Julian, who alone had survived a series of crimes and calamities such as the tragic poets have deplored in the devoted lines of <PERSON>Pelops</PERSON> and of Cadmus.
 Virtues of <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> Crispus, the eldest son of Constantine, and the presumptive heir of the empire, is represented by impartial historians as an amiable and accomplished youth.
 The care of his education, or at least of his studies, was intrusted to Lactantius, the most eloquent of the Christians; a preceptor admirably qualified to form the taste and to excite the virtues of his illustrious disciple.
 (9) At the age of seventeen <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> was invested with the title of Caesar, and the administration of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> provinces, where the inroads of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> gave him an early occasion of signalising his military prowess.
 In the civil war which broke out soon afterwards, the father and son divided their powers; and this history has already celebrated the valour as well as conduct displayed by the latter in forcing the straits of the Hellespont, so obstinately defended by the superior fleet of Licinius.
 This naval victory contributed to determine the event of the war, and the names of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and of <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> were united in the joyful acclamations of their eastern subjects, who loudly proclaimed that the world had been subdued, and was now governed, by an emperor endowed with every virtue, and by his illustrious son, a prince beloved of Heaven, and the lively image of his father's perfections.
 The public favour, which seldom accompanies old age, diffused its lustre over the youth of Crispus.
 He deserved the esteem and he engaged the affections of the court, the army, and the people.
 The experienced merit of a reigning monarch is acknowledged by his subjects with reluctance, and frequently denied with partial and discontented murmurs; while, from the opening virtues of his successor, they fondly conceive the most unbounded hopes of private as well as public felicity.
(10) Jealousy of Constantine.
 A.
D.
 324, October 10.
 This dangerous popularity soon excited the attention of Constantine, who, both as a father and as a king, was impatient of an equal.
 Instead of attempting to secure the allegiance of his son by the generous ties of confidence and gratitude, he resolved to prevent the mischiefs which might be apprehended from dissatisfied ambition.
 <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> soon had reason to complain that, while his infant brother <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was sent with the title of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> to reign over his peculiar department of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> provinces,(11) he, a prince of mature years, who had performed such recent and signal services, instead of being raised to the superior rank of Augustus, was confined almost a prisoner to his father's court, and exposed, without power or defence, to every calumny which the malice of his enemies could suggest.
 Under such painful circumstances the royal youth might not always be able to compose his behaviour or suppress his discontent and we may be assured that he was encompassed by a train of indiscreet or perfidious followers, who assiduously studied to inflame, and who were perhaps instructed to betray, the unguarded warmth of his resentment.
A.
D.
 325, October 1 An edict of Constantine, published about this time, manifestly indicates his real or affected suspicions that a secret conspiracy had been formed against his person and government.
 By all the allurements of honours and rewards he invites informers of every degree to accuse, without exception, his magistrates or ministers, his friends or his most intimate favourites, protesting, with a solemn asseveration, that he himself will listen to the charge, that he himself will revenge his injuries; and concluding with a prayer, which discovers some apprehension of danger, that the providence of the Supreme Being may still continue to protect the safety of the emperor and of the empire.
(12) Disgrace and death of Crispus, A.
D.
 326, <DATE>July</DATE> The informers who complied with so liberal an invitation were sufficiently versed in the arts of courts to select the friends and adherents of <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> as the guilty persons; nor is there any reason to distrust the veracity of the emperor who had promised an ample measure of revenge and punishment.
 The policy of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> maintained, however, the same appearances of regard and confidence towards a son whom he began to consider as his most irreconcilable enemy.
 Medals were struck with the customary vows for the long and auspicious reign of the young Caesar;(13) and as the people who was not admitted into the secrets of the palace, still loved his virtues and respected his dignity, a poet, who solicits his recall from exile adores with equal devotion the majesty of the father and that of the son.
(14) The time was now arrived for celebrating the august ceremony of the twentieth year of the reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and the emperor, for that purpose, removed his court from <GPE>Nicomedia</GPE> to Rome, where the most splendid preparations had been made for his reception.
 Every eye and every tongue affected to express their sense of the general happiness, and the veil of ceremony and dissimulation was drawn for a while over the darkest designs of revenge and murder.
(15) In the midst of the festival the unfortunate <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> was apprehended by order of the emperor, who laid aside the tenderness of a father without assuming the equity of a judge.
 The examination was short and private;(16) and as it was thought decent to conceal the fate of the young prince from the eyes of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, he was sent under a strong guard to Pola, in Istria, where, soon afterwards, he was put to death, either by the hand of the executioner or by the more gentle operation of poison.
(17) The <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> Liciniuss, a youth of amiable manners, was involved in the ruin of Crispus,(18) and the stern jealousy of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was unmoved by the prayers and tears of his favourite sister, pleading for the life of a son whose rank was his only crime, and whose loss she did not long survive.
 The story of these unhappy princes, the nature and evidence of their guilt, the forms of their trial, and the circumstances of their death, were buried in mysterious obscurity, and the courtly bishop, who has celebrated in an elaborate work the virtues and piety of his hero, observes a prudent silence on the subject of these tragic events.
(19) Such haughty contempt for the opinion of mankind, whilst it imprints an indelible stain on the memory of Constantine, must remind us of the very different behaviour of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the greatest monarchs of the present age.
 The Czar Peter, in the full possession of despotic power, submitted to the judgment of Russia, of Europe, and of posterity, the reasons which had compelled him to subscribe the condemnation of a criminal, or at least of a degenerate, son.
 (20) The empress <PERSON>Fausta</PERSON> The innocence of <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> was so universally acknowledged that the modern Greeks, who adore the memory of their founder, are reduced to palliate the guilt of a parricide which the common feelings of human nature forbade them to justify.
 They pretend that, as soon as the afflicted father discovered the falsehood of the accusation by which his credulity had been so fatally misled, he published to the world his repentance and remorse; that he mourned forty days, during which he abstained from the use of the bath and all the ordinary comforts of life; and that, for the lasting instruction of posterity, he erected a golden statue of Crispus, with this memorable inscription, - TO MY SON, WHOM I UNJUSTLY CONDEMNED.
 (21) A tale so moral and so interesting would deserve to be supported by less exceptionable authority; but if we consult the more ancient and authentic writers, they will inform us that the repentance of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was manifested only in acts of blood and revenge, and that he atoned for the murder of an innocent son by the execution, perhaps, of a guilty wife.
 They ascribe the misfortunes of <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> to the arts of his stepmother, Fausta, whose implacable hatred or whose disappointed love renewed in the palace of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the ancient tragedy of <PERSON>Hippolytus</PERSON> and of Phaedra.
(22) Like the daughter of Minos, the daughter of <PERSON>Maximian</PERSON> accused her son-in-law of an incestuous attempt on the chastity of his father's wife and easily obtained, from the jealousy of the emperor, a sentence of death against a young prince whom she considered with reason as the most formidable rival of her own children.
 But Helena, the aged mother of Constantine, lamented and revenged the untimely fate of her grandson Crispus; nor was it long before a real or pretended discovery was made that <PERSON>Fausta</PERSON> herself entertained a criminal connection with a slave belonging to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> stables.
(23) Her condemnation and punishment were the instant consequences of the charge, and the adulteress was suffocated by the steam of a bath, which, for that purpose, had been heated to an extraordinary degree.
(24) By some it will perhaps be thought that the remembrance of a <NORP>Conjugal</NORP> union of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> years, and the honour of their common offspring, the destined heirs of the throne, might have softened the obdurate heart of Constantine, and persuaded him to suffer his wife, however guilty she might appear, to expiate her offences in a solitary prison.
 But it seems a superfluous labour to weight the propriety, unless we could ascertain the truth, of this singular event, which is attended with some circumstances of doubt and perplexity.
 Those who have attacked, and those who have defended, the character of Constantine, have alike disregarded <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> very remarkable passages of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> orations pronounced under the succeeding reign.
 The former celebrates the virtues, the beauty, and the fortune of the empress Fausta, the daughter, wife, sister, and mother of so many princes.
(25) The latter asserts, in explicit terms, that the mother of the younger Constantine, who was slain <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> after his father's death, survived to weep over the fate of her son.
 (26) Notwithstanding the positive testimony of several writers of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> as well as of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion, there may still remain some reason to believe, or at least to suspect, that <PERSON>Fausta</PERSON> escaped the blind and suspicious cruelty of her husband.
 The deaths of a son and of a nephew, with the execution of a great number of respectable and perhaps innocent friends,(27) who were involved in their fall, may be sufficient, however, to justify the discontent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people, and to explain the satirical verses affixed to the palace gate, comparing the splendid and bloody reigns of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> and Nero.
(28) The sons and nephews of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> By the death of <PERSON>Crispus</PERSON> the inheritance of the empire seemed to devolve on the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons of Fausta, who have been already mentioned under the names of Constantine, Constantius, and of Constans.
 These young princes were successively invested with the title of Caesar, and the dates of their promotion may be referred to the tenth, the twentieth, and the thirtieth <DATE>years</DATE> of the reign of their father.
(29) This conduct, though it tended to multiply the future masters of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, might be excused by the partiality of paternal affection; but it is not so easy to understand the motives of the emperor, when he endangered the safety both of his family and of his people by the unnecessary elevation of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nephews, <PERSON>Dalmatius</PERSON> and Hannibalianus.
 The former was raised, by the title of Caesar, to an equality with his cousins.
 In favour of the latter, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> invented the new and singular appellation of Nobilissimus, (30) to which he annexed the flattering distinction of a robe of purple and gold.
 But of the whole series of <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes in any age of the empire <PERSON>Hannibalianus</PERSON> alone was distinguished by the title of KING, a name which the subjects of <PERSON>Tiberius</PERSON> would have detested as the profane and cruel insult of capricious tyranny.
 The use of such a title, even as it appears under the reign of Constantine, is a strange and unconnected fact, which can scarcely be admitted on the joint authority of <ORG>Imperial</ORG> medals and contemporary writers.
(31) Their education The whole empire was deeply interested in the education of these <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> youths, the acknowledged successors of Constantine.
 The exercises of the body prepared them for the fatigues of war and the duties of active life.
 Those who occasionally mention the education or talents of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> allow that he excelled in the gymnastic arts of leaping and running; that he was a dexterous archer, a skilful horseman, and a master of all the different weapons used in the service either of the cavalry or of the infantry.
(32) The same assiduous cultivation was bestowed, though not perhaps with equal success, to improve the minds of the sons and nephews of Constantine.
(33) The most celebrated professors of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith, of the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> philosophy, and of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> jurisprudence, were invited by the liberality of the emperor, who reserved for himself the important task of instructing the royal youths in the science of government and the knowledge of mankind.
 But the genius of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> himself had been formed by adversity and experience.
 In the free intercourse of private life, and amidst the dangers of the court of Galerius, he had learned to command his own passions, to encounter those of his equals, and to depend for his present safety and future greatness on the prudence and firmness of his personal conduct.
 His destined successors had the misfortune of being born and educated in the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> purple.
 Incessantly surrounded with a train of flatterers, they passed their youth in the enjoyment of luxury and the expectation of a throne; nor would the dignity of their rank permit them to descend from that elevated station from whence the various characters of human nature appear to wear a smooth and uniform aspect.
 The indulgence of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> admitted them, at a very tender age, to share the administration of the empire; and they studied the art of reigning, at the expense of the people intrusted to their care.
 The younger <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was appointed to hold his court in Gaul; and his brother <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> exchanged that department, the ancient patrimony of their father, for the more opulent, but less martial, countries of the East.
 Italy, the Western Illyricum, and Africa, were accustomed to revere Constans, the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of his sons, as the representative of the great Constantine.
 He fixed <PERSON>Dalmatius</PERSON> on the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> frontier, to which he annexed the government of Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece.
 The city of <GPE>Caesarea</GPE> was chosen for the residence of Hannibalianus; and the provinces of Pontus, Cappadocia, and the Lesser Armenia, were designed to form the extent of his new kingdom.
 For each of these princes a suitable establishment was provided.
 A just proportion of guards, of legions, and of auxiliaries, was allotted for their respective dignity and defence.
 The ministers and generals who were placed about their persons were such as <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> could trust to assist, and even to control, these youthful sovereigns in the exercise of their delegated power.
 As they advanced in <DATE>years</DATE> and experience, the limits of their authority were insensibly enlarged: but the emperor always reserved for himself the title of Augustus; and while he showed the <ORG>Caesars</ORG> to the armies and provinces, he maintained every part of the empire in equal obedience to its supreme head.
 (34) The tranquillity of the last fourteen <DATE>years</DATE> of his reign was scarcely interrupted by the contemptible insurrection of a camel-driver in the island of Cyprus, (35) or by the active part which the policy of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> engaged him to assume in the wars of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and Sarmatians.
 Manners of the <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> Among the different branches of the human race, the <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> form a very remarkable shade; as they seem to unite the manners of the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> barbarians with the figure and complexion of the ancient inhabitants of Europe.
 According to the various accidents of peace and war, of alliance or conquest, the <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> were sometimes confined to the banks of the Tanais, and they sometimes spread themselves over the immense plains which lie between the <NORP>Vistula</NORP> and the Volga.
(36) The care of their numerous flocks and herds, the pursuit of game, and the exercise of war, or rather of rapine, directed the vagrant motions of the Sarmatians.
 The movable camps or cities, the ordinary residence of their wives and children, consisted only of large waggons drawn by oxen, and covered in the form of tents.
 The military strength of the nation was composed of cavalry; and the custom of their warriors to lead in their hand <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> spare horses enabled them to advance and to retreat with a rapid diligence, which surprised the security, and eluded the pursuit, of a distant enemy.
(37) Their poverty of iron prompted their rude industry to invent a sort of cuirass, which was capable of resisting a sword or javelin, though it was formed only of horses hoofs, cut into thin and polished slices, carefully laid over each other in the manner of scales or feathers, and strongly sewed upon an undergarment of coarse linen.
 (38) The offensive arms of the <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> were short daggers, long lances, and a weighty bow with a quiver of arrows.
 They were reduced to the necessity of employing fish-bones for the points of their weapons; but the custom of dipping them in a venomous liquor, that poisoned the wounds which they inflicted, is alone sufficient to prove the most savage manners; since a people impressed with a sense of humanity would have abhorred so cruel a practice, and a nation skilled in the arts of war would have disdained so impotent a resource.
(39) Whenever these barbarians issued from their deserts in quest of prey, their shaggy beards, uncombed locks, the furs with which they were covered from head to foot, and their fierce countenancess which seemed to express the innate cruelty of their minds, inspired the more civilised provincials of <GPE>Rome</GPE> with horror and dismay.
 Their settlement near the Danube.
 The tender Ovid, after a youth spent in the enjoyment of fame and luxury, was condemned to an hopeless exile on the frozen banks of the Danube, where he was exposed, almost without defence, to the fury of these monsters of the desert, with whose stern spirits he feared that his gentle shade might hereafter be confounded.
 In his pathetic, but sometimes unmanly lamentations, (40) he describes in the most lively colours the dress and manners, the arms and inroads; of the <NORP>Getae</NORP> and Sarmatians, who were associated for the purposes of destruction; and from the accounts of history there is some reason to believe that these <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> were the Jazygae, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most numerous and warlike tribes of the nation.
 The allurements of plenty engaged them to seek a permanent establishment on the frontiers of the empire.
 Soon after the reign of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> they obliged the Dacians, who subsisted by fishing on the banks of the river <GPE>Theiss</GPE> or Tibiscus, to retire into the hilly country, and to abandon to the victorious <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> the fertile plains of the Upper Hungary, which are bounded by the course of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the semicircular enclosure of the <NORP>Carpathian</NORP> mountains.
(41) In this advantageous position they watched or suspended the moment of attack, as they were provoked by injuries or appeased by presents; they gradually acquired the skill of using more dangerous weapons; and although the <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> did not illustrate their name by any memorable exploits, they occasionally assisted their eastern and western neighbours, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the Germans, with a formidable body of cavalry.
 They lived under the irregular aristocracy of their chieftains, (42) but after they had received into their bosom the fugitive <NORP>Vandals</NORP> who yielded to the pressure of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> power, they seem to have chosen a king from that nation, and from the illustrious race of the Astingi, who had formerly dwelt on the shores of the northern ocean.
 (43) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war, A.
lD.
 331.
 This motive of enmity must have inflamed the subjects of contention which perpetually arise on the confines of warlike and independent nations.
 The <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> princes were stimulated by fear and revenge; the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> kings aspired to extend their dominion from the <NORP>Euxine</NORP> to the frontiers of Germany; and the waters of the Maros, a small river which falls into the Theiss, were stained with the blood of the contending barbarians.
 After some experience of the superior strength and numbers of their adversaries, the <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> implored the protection of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarch, who beheld with pleasure the discord of the nations, but who was justly alarmed by the progress of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> arms.
 As soon as <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had declared himself in favour of the weaker party, the haughty Araric, king of the Goths, instead of expecting the attack of the legions, boldly passed the Danube, and spread terror and devastation through the province of Maesia.
 To oppose the inroad of this destroying host the aged emperor took the field in person; but on this occasion either his conduct or his fortune betrayed the glory which he had acquired in so many foreign and domestic wars.
 He had the mortification of seeing his troops fly before an inconsiderable detachment of the barbarians, who pursued them to the edge of their fortified camp, and obliged him to consult his safety by a precipitate and ignominious retreat.
 (44) The event of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and more successful action retrieved the honour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name; and the powers of art and discipline prevailed, after an obstinate contest, over the efforts of irregular valour.
 The broken army of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> abandoned the field of battle, the wasted province, and the passage of the Danube: and although the eldest of the sons of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was permitted to supply the place of his father, the A.
D.
 332, April 20.
 merit of the victory, which diffused universal joy, was ascribed to the auspicious counsels of the emperor himself.
 He contributed at least to improve this advantage by his negotiations with the free and warlike people of Chersonesus,(45) whose capital, situated on the western coast of the <LOC>Tauric</LOC> or Crimaean peninsula, still retained some vestiges of a <NORP>Grecian</NORP> colony, and was governed by a perpetual magistrate, assisted by a council of senators, emphatically styled the Fathers of the City.
 The <PERSON>Chersonites</PERSON> were animated against the <NORP>Goths</NORP> by the memory of the wars which, in the preceding century, they had maintained with unequal forces against the invaders of their country.
 They were connected with the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the mutual benefits of commerce; as they were supplied from the provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> with corn and manufactures, which they purchased with their only productions, salt, wax, and hides.
 Obedient to the requisition of Constantine, they prepared under the conduct of their magistrate Diogenes, a considerable army, of which the principal strength consisted in cross-bows and military chariots.
 The speedy march and intrepid attack of the Chersonites, by diverting the attention of the Goths, assisted the operations of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> generals.
 The Goths, vanquished on every side, were driven into the mountains, where, in the course of a severe campaign, above an hundred thousand were computed to have perished by cold and hunger.
 Peace was at length granted to their humble supplications; the eldest son of <PERSON>Araric</PERSON> was accepted as the most valuable hostage; and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> endeavoured to convince their chiefs, by a liberal distribution of honours and rewards, how far the friendship of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> was preferable to their enmity.
 In the expressions of his gratitude towards the faithful Chersonites, the emperor was still more magnificent.
 The pride of the nation was gratified by the splendid and almost royal decorations bestowed on their magistrate and his successors.
 A perpetual exemption from all duties was stipulated for their vessels which traded to the ports of the Black Sea.
 A regular subsidy was promised, of iron, corn, oil, and of every supply which could be useful either in peace or war.
 But it was thought that the <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> were sufficiently rewarded by their deliverance from impending ruin and the emperor, perhaps with too strict an economy, deducted some part of the expenses of the war from the customary gratifications which were allowed to that turbulent nation.
 Expulsion of the Sarmatians, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>334</CARDINAL> Exasperated by this apparent neglect, the <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> soon forgot, with the levity of barbarians, the services which they had so lately received, and the dangers which still threatened their safety.
 Their inroads on the territory of the empire provoked the indignation of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to leave them to their fate; and he no longer opposed the ambition of Geberic, a renowned warrior, who had recently ascended the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> throne.
 Wisumar, the <PERSON>Vandal</PERSON> king, whilst, alone and unassisted, he defended his dominions with undaunted courage, was vanquished and slain in a decisive battle which swept away the flower of the <NORP>Sarmatian</NORP> youth.
 The remainder of the nation embraced the desperate expedient of arming their slaves, a hardy race of hunters and herdsmen, by whose tumultuary aid they revenged their defeat, and expelled the invader from their confines.
 But they soon discovered that they had exchanged a foreign for a domestic enemy, more dangerous and more implacable.
 Enraged by their former servitude, elated by their present glory, the slaves, under the name of Limigantes, claimed and usurped the possession of the country which they had saved.
 Their masters, unable to withstand the ungoverned fury of the populace, preferred the hardships of exile to the tyranny of their servants.
 Some of the fugitive <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> solicited a less ignominious dependence under the hostile standard of the Goths.
 A more numerous band retired beyond the <NORP>Carpathian</NORP> mountains, among the Quadi, their <NORP>German</NORP> allies, and were easily admitted to share a superfluous waste of uncultivated land.
 But the far greater part of the distressed nation turned their eyes towards the fruitful provinces of Rome.
 Imploring the protection and forgiveness of the emperor, they solemnly promised, as subjects in peace, and as soldiers in war, the most inviolable fidelity to the empire which should graciously receive them into its bosom.
 According to the maxims adopted by <PERSON>Probus</PERSON> and his successors, the offers of this barbarian colony were eagerly accepted; and a competent portion of lands in the provinces of Pannonia, Thrace, Macedonia, and Italy, were immediately assigned for the habitation and subsistence of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred thousand Sarmatians.
(46) Death and funeral of Constantine, A.
D.
 335, <DATE>July</DATE> 25.
 By chastising the pride of the Goths, and by accepting the homage of a suppliant nation, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> asserted the majesty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire; and the ambassadors of Aethiopia, Persia, and the most remote countries of India, congratulated the peace and prosperity of his government.
(47) If he reckoned among the favours of fortune the death of his eldest son, of his nephew, and perhaps of his wife, he enjoyed an uninterrupted flow of private as well as public felicity till the thirtieth year of his reign; a period which none of his predecessors; since Augustus, had been permitted to celebrate.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> survived that solemn festival about ten months; and, at the mature age of A.
D.
 337, May 22.
sixty-four, after a short illness, he ended his memorable life at the palace of Aquyrion, in the suburbs of Nicomedia, whither he had retired for the benefit of the air, and with the hope of recruiting his exhausted strength by the use of the warm baths.
 The excessive demonstrations of grief, or at least of mourning, surpassed what ever had been practised on any former occasion.
 Notwithstanding the claims of the senate and people of ancient Rome, the corpse of the deceased emperor, according to his last request, was transported to the city which was destined to preserve the name and memory of its founder.
 The body of Constantine, adorned with the vain symbols of greatness, the purple and diadem, was deposited on a golden bed in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of he apartments of the palace, which for that purpose had been splendidly furnished and illuminated.
 The forms of the court were strictly maintained.
 Every day, at the appointed hours, the principal officers of the state, the army, and the household, approaching the person of their sovereign with bended knees and a composed countenance, offered their respectful homage as seriously as if he had been still alive.
 From motives of policy, this theatrical representation was for some time continued; nor could flattery neglect the opportunity of remarking that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> alone, by the peculiar indulgence of Heaven, had reigned after his death.
(48) Factions of the court.
 But this reign could subsist only in empty pageantry; and it was soon discovered that the will of the most absolute monarch is seldom obeyed when his subjects have no longer anything to hope from his favour, or to dread from is resentment.
 The same ministers and generals who bowed with such reverential awe before the inanimate corpse of their deceased sovereign were engaged in secret consultations to exclude his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nephews, <PERSON>Dalmatius</PERSON> and Hannialianus, from the share which he had assigned them in the succession of the empire.
 We are too imperfectly acquainted with the court of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to form any judgment of the real motives which influenced the leaders of the conspiracy; unless we should suppose that they were actuated by a spirit of jealousy and revenge against the praefect Ablavius, a proud favourite, who had long directed the counsels and abused the confidence of the late emperor.
 The arguments by which they solicited the concurrence of the soldiers and people are of a more obvious nature: and they might with decency, as well as truth, insist on the superior rank of the children of Constantine, the danger of multiplying the number of sovereigns, and the impending mischiefs which threatened the republic, from the discord of so many rival princes who were not connected by the tender sympathy of fraternal affection.
 The intrigue was conducted with zeal and secrecy, till a loud and unanimous declaration was procured from the troops that they would suffer none except the sons of their lamented monarch to reign over the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
(49) The younger Dalmatius, who was united with his collateral relations by the ties of friendship and interest, is allowed to have inherited a considerable share of the abilities of the great Constantine; but, on this occasion, he does not appear to have concerted any measures for supporting by arms the just claims which himself and his royal brother derived from the liberality of their uncle.
 Astonished and overwhelmed by the tide of popular fury, they seem to have remained, without the power of flight or of resistance, in the hands of their implacable enemies.
 Their fate was suspended till the arrival of Constantius, the second,(50) and perhaps the most favoured, of the sons of Constantine.
 Massacre of the princes.
 The voice of the dying emperor had recommended the care of his funeral to the piety of Constantius; and that prince, by the vicinity of his eastern station, could easily prevent the diligence of his brothers, who resided in their distant governments of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Gaul.
 As soon as he had taken possession of the palace of Constantinople, his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> care was to remove the apprehensions of his kinsmen, by a solemn oath which he pledged for their security.
 His next employment was to find some specious pretence which might release his conscience from the obligation of an imprudent promise.
 The arts of fraud were made subservient to the designs of cruelty; and a manifest forgery was attested by a person of the most sacred character.
 From the hands of the bishop of Nicomedia, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> received a fatal scroll, affirmed to be the genuine testament of his father; in which the emperor expressed his suspicions that he had been poisoned by his brothers; and conjured his sons to revenge his death, and to consult their own safety, by the punishment of the guilty.
 (51) Whatever reasons might have been alleged by these unfortunate princes to defend their life and honour against so incredible an accusation, they were silenced by the furious clamours of the soldiers, who declared themselves, at once, their enemies, their judges, and their executioners.
 The spirit, and even the forms, of legal proceedings were repeatedly violated in a promiscuous massacre; which involved the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> uncles of Constantius, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> of his cousins, of whom <PERSON>Dalmatius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Hannibalianus</PERSON> were the most illustrious, the <NORP>Patrician</NORP> Optatus, who had married a sister of the late emperor, and the praefect Ablavius, whose power and riches had inspired him with some hopes of obtaining the purple.
 If it were necessary to aggravate the horrors of this bloody scene, we might add that <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> himself had espoused the daughter of his uncle Julius, and that he had bestowed his sister in marriage on his cousin Hannibalianus.
 These alliances, which the policy of Constantine, regardless of the public prejudice,(52) had formed between the several branches of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> house, served only to convince mankind that these princes were as cold to the endearments of conjugal affection, as they were insensible to the ties of consanguinity and the moving entreaties of youth and innocence.
 Of so numerous a family, <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> alone, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> youngest children of <PERSON>Julius</PERSON> Constantius, were saved from the hands of the assassins, till their rage, satiated with slaughter, had in some measure subsided.
 The emperor Constantius, who, in the absence of his brothers, was the most obnoxious to guilt and reproach, discovered, on some future occasions, a faint and transient remorse for those cruelties which the perfidious counsels of his ministers and the irresistible violence of the troops, had extorted from his inexperienced youth.
(53) Division of the empire, A.
D.
 337, Sept.
 <CARDINAL>11</CARDINAL> The massacre of the <NORP>Flavian</NORP> race was succeeded by a new division of the provinces, which was ratified in a personal interview of the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> brothers.
 Constantine, the eldest of the Caesars, obtained, with a certain pre-eminence of rank, the possession of the new capital, which bore his own name and that of his father.
 <GPE>Thrace</GPE> and the countries of the <LOC>East</LOC> were allotted for the patrimony of Constantius; and <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> was acknowledged as the lawful sovereign of Italy, Africa, and the western Illyricum.
 The armies submitted to their hereditary right, and they condescended, after some delay, to accept from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> senate the title of Augustus.
 When they <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> assumed the reins of government, the eldest of these princes was twenty-one, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> twenty, and the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> only seventeen, <DATE>years</DATE> of age.
(54) <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> king of Persia, A.
D.
 310.
 While the martial nations of <LOC>Europe</LOC> followed the standards of his brothers, Constantius, at the head of the effeminate troops of Asia, was left to sustain the weight of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war.
 At the decease of Constantine, the throne of the <LOC>East</LOC> was filled by Sapor, son of Hormouz, or Hormisdas, and grandson of Narses, who, after the victory of Galerius, had humbly confessed the superiority of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> power.
 Although <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> was in the thirtieth year of his long reign, he was still in the vigour of youth, as the date of his accession, by a very strange fatality, had preceded that of his birth.
 The wife of <PERSON>Hormouz</PERSON> remained pregnant at the time of her husband's death, and the uncertainty of the sex, as well as of the event, excited the ambitious hopes of the princes of the house of Sassan.
 The apprehensions of civil war were at length removed by the positive assurance of the <PERSON>Magi</PERSON> that the widow of <PERSON>Hormouz</PERSON> had conceived, and would safely produce a son.
 Obedient to the voice of superstition, the <NORP>Persians</NORP> prepared, without delay, the ceremony of his coronation.
 A royal bed, on which the queen lay in state, was exhibited in the midst of the palace; the diadem was placed on the spot which might be supposed to conceal the future heir of Artaxerxes, and the prostrate satraps adored the majesty of their invisible and insensible sovereign.
(55) If any credit can be given to this marvellous tale, which seems, however, to be countenanced by the manners of the people and by the extraordinary duration of his reign, we must admire not only the fortune but the genius of Sapor.
 In the soft sequestered education of a <NORP>Persian</NORP> harem the royal youth could discover the importance of exercising the vigour of his mind and body, and by his personal merit deserved a throne on which he had been seated while he was yet unconscious of the duties and temptations of absolute power.
 His minority was exposed to the almost inevitable calamities of domestic discord; his capital was surprised and plundered by Thair, a powerful king of <GPE>Yemen</GPE> or Arabia, and the majesty of the royal family was degraded by the captivity of a princess, the sister of the deceased king.
 But as soon as <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> attained the age of manhood the presumptuous Thair, his nation, and his country, fell beneath the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> effort of the young warrior, who used his victory with so judicious a mixture of rigour and clemency that he obtained from the fears and gratitude of the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> the title of Dhoulacnaf, or protector of the nation.
(56) State of <GPE>Mesopotamia</GPE> and Armenia.
 The ambition of the Persian, to whom his enemies ascribe the virtues of a soldier and a statesman, was animated by the desire of revenging the disgrace of his fathers, and of wresting from the hands of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> provinces beyond the Tigris.
 The military fame of Constantine, and the real or apparent strength of his government, suspended the attack, and, while the hostile conduct of <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> provoked the resentment, his artful negotiations amused the patience of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court.
 The death of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was the signal of war,(57) and the actual condition of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> and <NORP>Armenian</NORP> frontier seemed to encourage the <NORP>Persians</NORP> by the prospect of a rich spoil and an easy conquest.
 The example of the massacres of the palace diffused a spirit of licentiousness and sedition among the troops of the East, who were no longer restrained by their habits of obedience to a veteran commander.
 By the prudence of Constantius, who, from the interview with his brothers in Pannonia, immediately hastened to the banks of the Euphrates, the legions were gradually restored to a sense of duty and discipline; but the season of anarchy had permitted <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> to form the siege of Nisibis, and to occupy several of the most important fortresses of Mesopotamia.
 (58) In <GPE>Armenia</GPE> the renowned <PERSON>Tiridates</PERSON> had long enjoyed the peace and glory which he deserved by his valour and fidelity to the cause of Rome.
 The firm alliance which he maintained with <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was productive of spiritual as well as of temporal benefits; by the conversion of <PERSON>Tiridates</PERSON> the character of a saint was applied to that of a hero, the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith was preached and established from the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> to the shores of the Caspian, and <GPE>Armenia</GPE> was attached to the empire by the double ties of policy and of religion.
 But as many of the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> nobles still refused to abandon the plurality of their gods and of their wives, the public tranquillity was disturbed by a discontented faction, which insulted the feeble age of their sovereign, and impatiently expected the A.
D.
 342.
 <TIME>hour</TIME> of his death.
 He died at length, after a reign of fifty-six years, and the fortune of the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> monarchy expired with Tiridates.
 His lawful heir was driven into exile, the <NORP>Christian</NORP> priests were either murdered or expelled from their churches, the barbarous tribes of <GPE>Albania</GPE> were solicited to descend from their mountains, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of the most powerful governors, usurping the ensigns or the powers of royalty, implored the assistance of Sapor, and opened the gates of their cities to the <NORP>Persian</NORP> garrisons.
 The <NORP>Christian</NORP> party, under the guidance of the archbishop of Artaxata, the immediate successor of St.
 Gregory the Illuminator, had recourse to the piety of Constantius.
 After the troubles had continued about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, Antiochus, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the officers of the household, executed with success the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> commission of restoring Chosroes, the son of Tiridates, to the throne of his fathers, of distributing honours and rewards among the faithful servants of the house of Arsaces, and of proclaiming a general amnesty, which was accepted by the greater part of the rebellious satraps.
 But the <NORP>Romans</NORP> derived more honour than advantage from this revolution.
 <PERSON>Chosroes</PERSON> was a prince of a puny stature and a pusillanimous spirit.
 Unequal to the fatigues of war, averse to the society of mankind, he withdrew from his capital to a retired palace which he built on the banks of the river Eleutherus, and in the centre of a shady grove, where he consumed his vacant <TIME>hours</TIME> in the rural sports of hunting and hawking.
 To secure this inglorious ease, he submitted to the conditions of peace which <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> condescended to impose: the payment of an annual tribute, and the restitution of the fertile province of Atropatene, which the courage of <PERSON>Tiridates</PERSON> and the victorious arms of <PERSON>Galerius</PERSON> had annexed to the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> monarchy.
(59) The <NORP>Persian</NORP> war, A.
D.
 337-360.
 During the long period of the reign of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> the provinces of the <LOC>East</LOC> were afflicted by the calamities of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war.
 The irregular incursions of the light troops alternately spread terror and devastation beyond the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> and beyond the Euphrates, from the gates of <GPE>Ctesiphon</GPE> to those of Antioch; and this active service was performed by the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> of the desert, who were divided in their interest and affections, some of their independent chiefs being enlisted in the party of Sapor, whilst others had engaged their doubtful fidelity to the emperor.
(60) The more grave and important operations of the war were conducted with equal vigour; and the armies of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Persia</GPE> encountered each other in <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> bloody fields, in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of which <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> himself commanded in person.
 (61) The event of the day was most commonly adverse to the Romans, but in A.
D.
 348 the battle of <GPE>Singara</GPE> their imprudent valour had almost achieved a signal and decisive victory.
 The stationary troops of <GPE>Singara</GPE> retired on the approach of Sapor, who passed the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> over <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> bridges, and occupied near the village of <GPE>Hilleh</GPE> an advantageous camp, which, by the labour of his numerous pioneers, he surrounded in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day with a deep ditch and a lofty rampart.
 His formidable host, when it was drawn out in order of battle, covered the banks of the river, the adjacent heights, and the whole extent of a plain of above twelve miles which separated the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies.
 Both were alike impatient to engage, but the barbarians, after a slight resistance, fled in disorder, unable to resist, or desirous to weary, the strength of the heavy legions, who, fainting with heat and thirst, pursued them across the plain, and cut in pieces a line of cavalry clothed in complete armour, which had been posted before the gates of the camp to protect their retreat.
 Constantius, who was hurried along in the pursuit, attempted, without effect, to restrain the ardour of his troops, by representing to them the dangers of the approaching night, and the certainty of completing their success with the return of day.
 As they depended much more on their own valour than on the experience or the abilities of their chief, they silenced by their clamours his timid remonstrances, and, rushing with fury to the charge, filled up the ditch, broke down the rampart, and dispersed themselves through the tents to recruit their exhausted strength, and to enjoy the rich harvest of their labours.
 But the prudent <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> had watched the moment of victory.
 His army, of which the greater part, securely posted on the heights, had been spectators of the action, advanced in silence and under the shadow of the night, and his <NORP>Persian</NORP> archers, guided by the illumination of the camp, poured a shower of arrows on a disarmed and licentious crowd.
 The sincerity of history(62) declares that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> were vanquished with a dreadful slaughter, and that the flying remnant of the legions was exposed to the most intolerable hardships.
 Even the tenderness of panegyric, confessing that the glory of the emperor was sullied by the disobedience of his soldiers, chooses to draw a veil over the circumstances of this melancholy retreat.
 Yet <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of those venal orators, so jealous of the fame of Constantius, relates, with amazing coolness, an act of such incredible cruelty, as, in the judgment of posterity, must imprint a far deeper stain on the honour of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> name.
 The son of Sapor, the heir of his crown, had been made a captive in the <NORP>Persian</NORP> camp.
 The unhappy youth, who might have excited the compassion of the most savage enemy, was scourged, tortured, and publicly executed by the inhuman Romans.
(63) Siege of Nisbis.
 Whatever advantages might attend the arms of <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> in the field, though <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> repeated victories diffused among the nations the fame of his valour and conduct, he could not hope to succeed in the execution of his designs while the fortified towns of Mesopotamia, and, above all, the strong and ancient city of Nisibis, remained in the possession of the Romans.
 In the space of twelve <DATE>years</DATE> Nisibis, which, since the time of Lucullus, had been deservedly esteemed the bulwark of the East, sustained <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> memorable sieges A.
D.
 338,346,350.
 against the power of Sapor, and the disappointed monarch, after urging his attacks above sixty, eighty, and an hundred days, was thrice repulsed with loss and ignominy.
(64) This large and populous city was situate about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days' journey from the Tigris, in the midst of a pleasant and fertile plain at the foot of Mount Masius.
 A treble enclosure of brick walls was defended by a deep ditch; (65) and the intrepid resistance of Count <PERSON>Lucilianus</PERSON> and his garrison was seconded by the desperate courage of the people.
 The citizens of <PERSON>Nisibis</PERSON> were animated by the exhortations of their bishop,(66) inured to arms by the presence of danger, and convinced of the intentions of <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> to plant a <NORP>Persian</NORP> colony in their room, and to lead them away into distant and barbarous captivity.
 The event of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former sieges elated their confidence and exasperated the haughty spirit of the Great King, who advanced a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time towards Nisibis, at the head of the united forces of <GPE>Persia</GPE> and India.
 The ordinary machines, invented to batter or undermine the walls, were rendered ineffectual by the superior skill of the Romans, and many days had vainly elapsed when <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> embraced a resolution worthy of an eastern monarch who believed that the elements themselves were subject to his power.
 At the stated season of the melting of the snows in Armenia, the river Mygdonius, which divides the plain and the city of Nisibis, forms, like the Nile,(67) an inundation over the adjacent country.
 By the labour of the <NORP>Persians</NORP> the course of the river was stopped below the town, and the waters were confined on every side by solid mounds of earth.
 On this artificial lake a fleet of armed vessels, filled with soldiers, and with engines which discharged stones of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> hundred pounds weight, advanced in order of battle, and engaged, almost upon a level, the troops which defended the ramparts The irresistible force of the waters was alternately fatal to the contending parties, till at length a portion of the walls, unable to sustain the accumulated pressure, gave way at once, and exposed an ample breach of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and fifty feet.
 The <NORP>Persians</NORP> were instantly driven to the assault, and the fate of <PERSON>Nisibis</PERSON> depended on the event of the day.
 The heavy-armed cavalry, who led the van of a deep column, were embarrassed in the mud, and great numbers were drowned in the unseen holes which had been filled by the rushing waters.
 The elephants, made furious by their wounds, increased the disorder, and trampled down <CARDINAL>thousands</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> archers.
 The Great King, who, from an exalted throne, beheld the misfortunes of his arms, sounded, with reluctant indignation, the signal of the retreat, and suspended for some <TIME>hours</TIME> the prosecution of the attack.
 But the vigilant citizens improved the opportunity of the night, and the return of day discovered a new wall of six feet in height rising every moment to fill up the interval of the breach.
 Notwithstanding the disappointment of his hopes and the loss of more than <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand men, <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> still pressed the reduction of <PERSON>Nisibis</PERSON> with an obstinate firmness which could have yielded only to the necessity of defending the eastern provinces of <GPE>Persia</GPE> against a formidable invasion of the Massagetae.
(68) Alarmed by this intelligence, he hastily relinquished the siege, and marched with rapid diligence from the banks of the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> to those of the Oxus.
 The danger and difficulties of the Scythian war engaged him soon afterwards to conclude, or at least to observe, a truce with the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor, which was equally grateful to both princes, as <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> himself, after the deaths of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers, was involved, by the revolutions of the West, in a civil contest which required and seemed to exceed the most vigorous exertion of his undivided strength.
 Civil war and death of Constantine, A.
D.
 340,March.
 After the partition of the empire <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> had scarcely elapsed before the sons of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> seemed impatient to convince mankind that they were incapable of contenting themselves with the dominions which they were unqualified to govern.
 The eldest of those princes soon complained that he was defrauded of his just proportion of the spoils of their murdered kinsmen; and though he might yield to the superior guilt and merit of Constantius, he exacted from <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> the cession of the <NORP>African</NORP> provinces, as an equivalent for the rich countries of <GPE>Macedonia</GPE> and <GPE>Greece</GPE> which his brother had acquired by the death of Dalmatius.
 The want of sincerity which <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> experienced in a tedious and fruitless negotiation exasperated the fierceness of his temper, and he eagerly listened to those favourites who suggested to him that his honour, as well as his interest.
 was concerned in the prosecution of the quarrel.
 At the head of a tumultuary band, suited for rapine rather than for conquest, he suddenly broke into the dominions of Constans, by the way of the <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> Alps, and the country round <GPE>Aquileia</GPE> felt the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> effects of his resentment.
 The measures of Constans, who then resided in Dacia, were directed with more prudence and ability.
 On the news of his brother's invasion he detached a select and disciplined body of his <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> troops, proposing to follow them in person with the remainder of his forces.
 But the conduct of his lieutenants soon terminated the unnatural contest.
 By the artful appearances of flight, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was betrayed into an ambuscade, which had been concealed in a wood, where the rash youth, with a few attendants, was surprised, surrounded, and slain.
 His body, after it had been found in the obscure stream of the Alsa, obtained the honours of an <ORG>Imperial</ORG> sepulchre, but his provinces transferred their allegiance to the conqueror, who, refusing to admit his elder brother <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> to any share in these new acquisitions, maintained the undisputed possession of more than two-thirds of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
(69) Murder of Constans, A.
D.
 350, February.
 The fate of <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> himself was delayed about ten <DATE>years</DATE> longer, and the revenge of his brother's death was reserved for the more ignoble hand of a domestic traitor.
 The pernicious tendency of the system introduced by <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was displayed in the feeble administration of his sons, who, by their vices and weakness, soon lost the esteem and affections of their people.
 The pride assumed by <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> from the unmerited success of his arms was rendered more contemptible by his want of abilities and application.
 His fond partiality towards some <NORP>German</NORP> captives, distinguished only by the charms of youth, was an object of scandal to the people;(70) and Magnentius, an ambitious soldier, who was himself of barbarian extraction, was encouraged by the public discontent to assert the honour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name.
(71) The chosen bands of <NORP>Jovians</NORP> and Herculians, who acknowledged <ORG>Magnentius</ORG> as their leader, maintained the most respectable and important station in the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> camp.
 The friendship of Marcellinus, count of the sacred largesses, supplied with a liberal hand the means of seduction.
 The soldiers were convinced, by the most specious arguments, that the republic summoned them to break the bonds of hereditary servitude, and, by the choice of an active and vigilant prince.
 to reward the same virtues which had raised the ancestors of the degenerate <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> from a private condition to the throne of the world.
 As soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution.
 Marcellinus, under the pretence of celebrating his son's birthday, gave a splendid entertainment to the illustrious and honourable persons of the court of Gaul, which then resided in the city of Autun.
 The intemperance of the feast was artfully protracted till a very late <TIME>hour</TIME> of the night, and the unsuspecting guests were tempted to indulge themselves in a dangerous and guilty freedom of conversation.
 On a sudden the doors were thrown open, and Magnentius, who had retired for a few moments, returned into the apartment, invested with the diadem and purple.
 The conspirators instantly saluted him with the titles of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and Emperor.
 The surprise, the terror, the intoxication, the ambitious hopes, and the mutual ignorance of the rest of the assembly prompted them to join their voices to the general acclamation.
 The guards hastened to take the oath of fidelity, the gates of the town were shut, and before the dawn of day <ORG>Magnentius</ORG> became master of the troops and treasure of the palace and city of Autun.
 By his secrecy and diligence he entertained some hopes of surprising the person of Constans, who was pursuing in the adjacent forest his favourite amusement of hunting, or perhaps some pleasures of a more private and criminal nature.
 The rapid progress of fame allowed him, however, an instant for flight, though the desertion of his soldiers and subjects deprived him of the power of resistance.
 Before he could reach a seaport in Spain, where he intended to embark, he was overtaken near Helena, (72) at the foot of the Pyrenees, by a party of light cavalry, whose chief, regardless of the sanctity of a temple, executed his commission by the murder of the son of Constantine.
(73) <ORG>Magnentius</ORG> and <PERSON>Vetranio</PERSON> assume the purple, A.
D.
 350, <DATE>March</DATE> 1.
 As soon as the death of <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> had decided this easy but important revolution, the example of the court of <GPE>Autun</GPE> was imitated by the provinces of the West.
 The authority of <ORG>Magnentius</ORG> was acknowledged through the whole extent of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great praefectures of <GPE>Gaul</GPE> and Italy; and the usurper prepared, by every act of oppression, to collect a treasure which might discharge the obligation of an immense donative and supply the expenses of a civil war.
 The martial countries of Illyricum, from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the extremity of Greece, had long obeyed the government of Vetranio, an aged general, beloved for the simplicity of his manners, and who had acquired some reputation by his experience and services in war.
(74) Attached by habit, by duty, and by gratitude to the house of Constantine, he immediately gave the strongest assurances to the only surviving son of his late master that he would expose, with unshaken fidelity, his person and his troops to inflict a just revenge on the traitors of Gaul.
 But the legions of <PERSON>Vetranio</PERSON> were seduced, rather than provoked, by the example of rebellion; their leader soon betrayed a want of firmness or a want of sincerity, and his ambition derived a specious pretence from the approbation of the princess Constantina.
 That cruel and aspiring woman, who had obtained from the great Constantine, her father, the rank of Augusta, placed the diadem with her own hands on the head of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> general, and seemed to expect from his victory the accomplishment of those unbounded hopes of which she had been disappointed by the death of her husband Hannibalianus.
 Perhaps it was without the consent of <PERSON>Constantina</PERSON> that the new emperor formed a necessary, though dishonourable, alliance with the usurper of the West, whose purple was so recently stained with her brother's blood.

.
 The intelligence of these important events, which so deeply affected the honour and safety of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> house, recalled the arms of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> from the inglorious prosecution of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war.
 He recommended the care of the <LOC>East</LOC> to his lieutenants, and afterwards to his cousin Gallus, whom he raised from a prison to a throne, and marched towards Europe, with a mind agitated by the conflict of hope and fear, of grief and indignation.
 On his arrival at <GPE>Heraclea</GPE> in Thrace, the emperor gave audience to the ambassadors of <ORG>Magnentius</ORG> and Vetranio.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> author of the conspiracy, Marcellinus, who in some measure had bestowed the purple on his new master, boldly accepted this dangerous commission; and his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> colleagues were selected from the illustrious personages of the state and army.
 These deputies were instructed to soothe the resentment, and to alarm the fears, of Constantius.
 They were empowered to offer him the friendship and alliance of the western princes, to cement their union by a double marriage, - of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> with the daughter of Magnentius, and of <ORG>Magnentius</ORG> himself with the ambitious Constantina, - and to acknowledge in the treaty the pre-eminence of rank which might justly be claimed by the emperor of the East.
 Should pride and mistaken piety urge him to refuse these equitable conditions, the ambassadors were ordered to expatiate on the inevitable ruin which must attend his rashness, if he ventured to provoke the sovereigns of the <LOC>West</LOC> to exert their superior strength, and to employ against him that valour, those abilities, and those legions, to which the house of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had been indebted for so many triumphs.
 Such propositions and such arguments appeared to deserve the most serious attention; the answer of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was deferred till the next day; and as he had reflected on the importance of justifying a civil war in the opinion of the people, he thus addressed his council, who listened with real or affected credulity: The authority of such a vision, or rather of the prince who alleged it, silenced every doubt, and excluded all negotiation.
 The ignominious terms of peace were rejected with disdain.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the ambassadors of the tyrant was dismissed with the haughty answer of Constantius; his colleagues, as unworthy of the privileges of the law of nations, were put in irons; and the contending powers prepared to wage an implacable war.
(76) Deposes Vetranio, A.
D.
 350, Dec.
 25.
 Such was the conduct, and such perhaps was the duty, of the brother of <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> towards the perfidious usurper of Gaul.
 The situation and character of <PERSON>Vetranio</PERSON> admitted of milder measures; and the policy of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> emperor was directed to disunite his antagonists, and to separate the forces of <GPE>Illyricum</GPE> from the cause of rebellion.
 It was an easy task to deceive the frankness and simplicity of Vetranio, who, fluctuating some time between the opposite views of honour and interest, displayed to the world the insincerity of his temper, and was insensibly engaged in the snares of an artful negotiation.
 <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> acknowledged him as a legitimate and equal colleague in the empire, on condition that he would renounce his disgraceful alliance with Magnentius, and appoint a place of interview on the frontiers of their respective provinces, where they might pledge their friendship by mutual vows of fidelity, and regulate by common consent the future operations of the civil war.
 In consequence of this agreement, <PERSON>Vetranio</PERSON> advanced to the city of Sardica,(77) at the head of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> thousand horse, and of a more numerous body of infantry; a power so far superior to the forces of Constantius, that the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> emperor appeared to command the life and fortunes of his rival, who, depending on the success of his private negotiations, had seduced the troops and undermined the throne of Vetranio.
 The chiefs, who had secretly embraced the party of Constantius, prepared in his favour a public spectacle, calculated to discover and inflame the passions of the multitude.
 (78) The united armies were commanded to assemble in a large plain near the city.
 In the centre, according to the rules of ancient discipline, a military tribunal, or rather scaffold, was erected, from whence the emperors were accustomed, on solemn and important occasions, to harangue the troops.
 The well-ordered ranks of <NORP>Romans</NORP> and barbarians, with drawn swords, or with erected spears, the squadrons of cavalry, and the cohorts of infantry, distinguished by the variety of their arms and ensigns, formed an immense circle around the tribunal; and the attentive silence which they preserved was sometimes interrupted by loud bursts of clamour or of applause.
 In the presence of this formidable assembly the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors were called upon to explain the situation of public affairs: the precedency of rank was yielded to the royal birth of Constantius; and though he was indifferently skilled in the arts of rhetoric, he acquitted himself, under these difficult circumstances, with firmness, dexterity, and eloquence.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> part of his oration seemed to be pointed only against the tyrant of Gaul; but while he tragically lamented the cruel murder of Constans, he insinuated that none, except a brother, could claim a right to the succession of his brother.
 He displayed, with some complacency, the glories of his <ORG>Imperial</ORG> race, and recalled to the memory of the troops the valour, the triumphs, the liberality of the great Constantine, to whose sons they had engaged their allegiance by an oath of fidelity, which the ingratitude of his most favoured servants had tempted them to violate.
 The officers, who surrounded the tribunal, and were instructed to act their parts in this extraordinary scene, confessed the irresistible power of reason and eloquence, by saluting the emperor <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> as their lawful sovereign.
 The contagion of loyalty and repentance was communicated from rank to rank, till the plain of <PERSON>Sardica</PERSON> resounded with the universal acclamation of The shout of thousands, their menacing gestures, the fierce clashing of their arms, astonished and subdued the courage of Vetranio, who stood, amidst the defection of his followers, in anxious and silent suspense.
 Instead of embracing the last refuge of generous despair, he tamely submitted to his fate, and, taking the diadem from his head, in the view of both armies fell prostrate at the feet of his conqueror.
 <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> used his victory with prudence and moderation; and raising from the ground the aged suppliant, whom he affected to style by the endearing name of Father, he gave him his hand to descend from the throne.
 The city of <GPE>Prusa</GPE> was assigned for the exile or retirement of the abdicated monarch, who lived six <DATE>years</DATE> in the enjoyment of ease and affluence.
 He often expressed his grateful sense of the goodness of Constantius, and, with a very amiable simplicity, advised his benefactor to resign the sceptre of the world, and to seek for content (where alone it could be found) in the peaceful obscurity of a private condition.
(79) Makes war against Magnentius, A.
D.
 351.
 The behaviour of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> on this memorable occasion was celebrated with some appearance of justice; and his courtiers compared the studied orations which a <PERSON>Pericles</PERSON> or a <NORP>Demosthenes</NORP> addressed to the populace of <GPE>Athens</GPE> with the victorious eloquence which had persuaded an armed multitude to desert and depose the object of their partial choice.
(80) The approaching contest with <ORG>Magnentius</ORG> was of a more serious and bloody kind.
 The tyrant advanced by rapid marches to encounter Constantius, at the head of a numerous army, composed of <NORP>Gauls</NORP> and Spaniards, of <NORP>Franks</NORP> and Saxons; of those provincials who supplied the strength of the legions, and of those barbarians who were dreaded as the most formidable enemies of the republic.
 The fertile plains (81) of the Lower Pannonia, between the Drave, the Save, and the Danube, presented a spacious theatre; and the operations of the civil war were protracted during the summer months by the skill or timidity of the combatants.
(82) <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> had declared his intention of deciding the quarrel in the fields of Cibalis, a name that would animate his troops by the remembrance of the victory which, on the same auspicious ground, had been obtained by the arms of his father <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> Yet, by the impregnable fortifications with which the emperor encompassed his camp, he appeared to decline rather than to invite a general engagement.
 It was the object of <ORG>Magnentius</ORG> to tempt or to compel his adversary to relinquish this advantageous position; and he employed with that view the various marches, evolutions, and stratagems which the knowledge of the art of war could suggest to an experienced officer.
 He carried by assault the important town of Siscia; made an attack on the city of Sirmium, which lay in the rear of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> camp; attempted to force a passage over the <FAC>Save</FAC> into the eastern provinces of Illyricum; and cut in pieces a numerous detachment which he had allured into the narrow passes of Adarne.
 During the greater part of the summer the tyrant of <GPE>Gaul</GPE> showed himself master of the field.
 The troops of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> were harassed and dispirited; his reputation declined in the eye of the world; and his pride condescended to solicit a treaty of peace, which would have resigned to the assassin of <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps.
 These offers were enforced by the eloquence of <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> ambassador; and the council as well as the army of <ORG>Magnentius</ORG> were disposed to accept them.
 But the haughty usurper, careless of the remonstrances of his friends, gave orders that <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> should be detained as a captive, or at least as an hostage; while he despatched an officer to reproach <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> with the weakness of his reign, and to insult him by the promise of a pardon if he would instantly abdicate the purple.
 was the only answer which honour permitted the emperor to return.
 But he was so sensible of the difficulties of his situation, that he no longer dared to retaliate the indignity which had been offered to his representative.
 The negotiation of <PERSON>Philip</PERSON> was not, however, ineffectual, since he determined <PERSON>Sylvanus</PERSON> the Frank, a general of merit and reputation, to desert with a considerable body of cavalry a few days before the battle of Mursa.
 Battle of Mursa, A.
D.
 351, Sept.
 28.
 The city of Mursa, or Essek, celebrated in modern times for a bridge of boats, <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> miles in length, over the river Drave, and the adjacent morasses, (83) has been always considered as a place of importance in the wars of Hungary.
 Magnentius, directing his march towards Mursa, set fire to the gates, and, by a sudden assault, had almost scaled the walls of the town.
 The vigilance of the garrison extinguished the flames; the approach of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> left him no time to continue the operations of the siege; and the emperor soon removed the only obstacle that could embarrass his motions, by forcing a body of troops which had taken post in an adjoining amphitheatre.
 The field of battle round <PERSON>Mursa</PERSON> was a naked and level plain: on this ground the army of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> formed, with the <FAC>Drave</FAC> on their right; while their left, either from the nature of their disposition, or from the superiority of their cavalry, extended far beyond the right flank of Magnentius.
 (84) The troops on both sides remained under arms in anxious expectation during the greatest part of the morning; and the son of Constantine, after animating his soldiers by an eloquent speech, retired into a church at some distance from the field of battle, and committed to his generals the conduct of this decisive day.
 (85) They deserved his confidence by the valour and military skill which they exerted.
 They wisely began the action upon the left; and advancing their whole wing of cavalry in an oblique line, they suddenly wheeled it on the right flank of the enemy, which was unprepared to resist the impetuosity of their charge.
 But the <NORP>Romans</NORP> of the <LOC>West</LOC> soon rallied by the habits of discipline; and the barbarians of <GPE>Germany</GPE> supported the renown of their national bravery.
 The engagement soon became general; was maintained with various and singular turns of fortune; and carcely ended with the darkness of the night.
 The signal victory which <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> obtained is attributed to the arms of his cavalry.
 His cuirassiers are described as so many massy statues of steel, glittering with their scaly armour, and breaking with their ponderous lances the firm array of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> legions.
 As soon as the legions gave way, the lighter and more active squadrons of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> line rode sword in hand into the intervals and completed the disorder.
 In the meanwhile, the huge bodies of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> were exposed almost naked to the dexterity of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> archers; and whole troops of those barbarians were urged by anguish and despair to precipitate themselves into the broad and rapid stream of the Drave.
(86) The number of the slain was computed at fifty-four thousand men, and the slaughter of the conquerors was more considerable than that of the vanquished;(87) a circumstance which proves the obstinacy of the contest, and justifies the observation of an ancient writer, that the forces of the empire were consumed in the fatal battle of Mursa, by the loss of a veteran army, sufficient to defend the frontiers, or to add new triumphs to the glory of Rome.
 (88) Notwithstanding the invectives of a servile orator, there is not the least reason to believe that the tyrant deserted his own standard in the beginning of the engagement.
 He seems to have displayed the virtues of a general and of a soldier till the day was irrecoverably lost, and his camp in the possession of the enemy.
 <ORG>Magnentius</ORG> then consulted his safety, and, throwing away the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> ornaments, escaped with some difficulty from the pursuit of the light horse, who incessantly followed his rapid flight from the banks of the <FAC>Drave</FAC> to the foot of the <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> Alps.
(89) Conquest of Italy, A.
D.
 352.
 The approach of <DATE>winter</DATE> supplied the indolence of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> with specious reasons for referring the prosecution of the war till the ensuing spring.
 <ORG>Magnentius</ORG> had fixed his residence in the city of Aquileia, and showed a seeming resolution to dispute the passage of the mountains and morasses which fortified the confines of the <NORP>Venetian</NORP> province.
 The surprisal of a castle in the <LOC>Alps</LOC> by the secret march of the imperialists could scarcely have determined him to relinquish the possession of Italy, if the inclinations of the people had supported the cause of their tyrant.
(90) But the memory of the cruelties exercised by his ministers, after the unsuccessful revolt of Nepotian, had left a deep impression of horror and resentment on the minds of the Romans.
 That rash youth, the son of the princess Eutropia, and the nephew of Constantine, had seen with indignation the sceptre of the <LOC>West</LOC> usurped by a perfidious barbarian.
 Arming a desperate troop of slaves and gladiators, he overpowered the feeble guard of the domestic tranquillity of Rome, received the homage of the senate, and, assuming the title of Augustus, precariously reigned during a tumult of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> eight days.
 The march of some regular forces put an end to his ambitious hopes: the rebellion was extinguished in the blood of Nepotian, of his mother Eutropia, and of his adherents; and the proscription was extended to all who had contracted a fatal alliance with the name and family of Constantine.
 (91) But as soon as Constantius, after the battle of Mursa, became master of the seacoast of Dalmatia, a band of noble exiles, who had ventured to equip a fleet in some harbour of the Adriatic, sought protection and revenge in his victorious camp.
 By their secret intelligence with their countrymen, <GPE>Rome</GPE> and the <NORP>Italian</NORP> cities were persuaded to display the banners of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> on their walls.
 The grateful veterans, enriched by the liberality of the father, signalised their gratitude and loyalty to the son.
 The cavalry, the legions, and the auxiliaries of Italy, renewed their oath of allegiance to Constantius; and the usurper, alarmed by the general desertion, was compelled, with the remains of his faithful troops, to retire beyond the <LOC>Alps</LOC> into the provinces of Gaul.
 The detachments, however, which were ordered either to press or to intercept the flight of Magnentius, conducted themselves with the usual imprudence of success; and allowed him, in the plains of Pavia, an opportunity of turning on his pursuers, and gratifying his despair by the carnage of a useless victory.
(92) Last defeat and death of Magnentius, A.
D.
 353, August 10.
.
 The pride of <ORG>Magnentius</ORG> was reduced, by repeated misfortunes, to sue, and to sue in vain, for peace.
 He <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> despatched a senator, in whose abilities he confided, and afterwards several bishops, whose holy character might obtain a more favourable audience, with the offer of resigning the purple, and the promise of devoting the remainder of his life to the services of the emperor.
 But Constantius, though he granted fair terms of pardon and reconciliation to all who abandoned the standard of rebellion,(93) avowed his inflexible resolution to inflict a just punishment on the crimes of an assassin whom he prepared to overwhelm on every side by the effort of his victorious arms.
 An <ORG>Imperial</ORG> fleet acquired the easy possession of <LOC>Africa</LOC> and Spain, confirmed the wavering faith of the <NORP>Moorish</NORP> nations, and landed a considerable force, which passed the Pyrenees, and advanced towards Lyons, the last and fatal station of Magnentius.
(94) The temper of the tyrant, which was never inclined to clemency, was urged by distress to exercise every act of oppression which could extort an immediate supply from the cities of Gaul.
(95) Their patience was at length exhausted; and Treves, the seat of <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> government, gave the signal of revolt, by shutting her gates against Decentius, who had been raised by his brother to the rank of either <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> or of Augustus.
(96) From Treves, <PERSON>Decentius</PERSON> was obliged to retire to Sens, where he was soon surrounded by an army of Germans, whom the pernicious arts of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> had introduced into the civil dissensions of Rome.
 (97) In the meantime the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> troops forced the passages of the Cottian Alps, and in the bloody combat of Mount Seleucus irrevocably fixed the title of rebels on the party of Magnentius.
(98) He was unable to bring another army into the field; the fidelity of his guards was corrupted; and when he appeared in public to animate them by his exhortations, he was saluted with an unanimous shout of "Long live the emperor Constantius!" The tyrant, who perceived that they were preparing to deserve pardon and rewards by the sacrifice of the most obnoxious criminal, prevented their design by falling on his sword;(99) a death more easy and more honourable than he could hope to obtain from the hands of an enemy whose revenge would have been coloured with the specious pretence of justice and fraternal piety.
 The example of suicide was imitated by Decentius, who strangled himself on the news of his brother's death.
 The author of the conspiracy, Marcellinus, had long since disappeared in the battle of Mursa, (100) and the public tranquillity was confirmed by the execution of the surviving leaders of a guilty and unsuccessful faction.
 A severe inquisition was extended over all who, either from choice or from compulsion, had been involved in the cause of rebellion.
 Paul, surnamed <PERSON>Catena</PERSON> from his superior skill in the judicial exercise of tyranny, was sent to explore the latent remains of the conspiracy in the remote province of Britain.
 The honest indignation expressed by Martin, vice-praefect of the island, was interpreted as an evidence of his own guilt; and the governor was urged to the necessity of turning against his breast the sword with which he had been provoked to wound the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> minister.
 The most innocent subjects of the <LOC>West</LOC> were exposed to exile and confiscation, to death and torture; and as the timid are always cruel, the mind of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was inaccessible to mercy.
