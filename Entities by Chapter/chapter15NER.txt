The progress of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion, and the sentiments, manners, numbers, and condition of the primitive ChristiansImportance of the inquiry A <ORG>CANDID</ORG> but rational inquiry into the progress and establishment of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> may be considered as a very essential part of the history of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 While that great body was invaded by open violence, or undermined by slow decay, a pure and humble religion gently insinuated itself into the minds of men, grew up in silence and obscurity, derived new vigour from opposition, and finally erected the triumphant banner of the Cross on the ruins of the Capitol.
 Nor was the influence of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> confined to the period or to the limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 After a revolution of thirteen or fourteen centuries, that religion is still professed by the nations of Europe, the most distinguished portion of human kind in arts and learning as well as in arms.
 By the industry and zeal of the <NORP>Europeans</NORP> it has been widely diffused to the most distant shores of <LOC>Asia</LOC> and Africa; and by the means of their colonies has been firmly established from <GPE>Canada</GPE> to Chili, in a world unknown to the ancients.
 Its difficulties But this inquiry, however useful or entertaining, is attended with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> peculiar difficulties.
 The scanty and suspicious materials of ecclesiastical history seldom enable us to dispel the dark cloud that hangs over the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> age of the church.
 The great law of impartiality too often obliges us to reveal the imperfections of the uninspired teachers and believers of the Gospel; and, to a careless observer, their faults may seem to cast a shade on the faith which they professed.
 But the scandal of the pious Christian, and the fallacious triumph of the Infidel, should cease as soon as they recollect not only by whom, but likewise to whom, the Divine Revelation was given.
 The theologian may indulge the pleasing task of describing <WORK_OF_ART>Religion</WORK_OF_ART> as she descended from Heaven, arrayed in her native purity.
 A more melancholy duty is imposed on the historian.
 He must discover the inevitable mixture of error and corruption which she contracted in long residence upon earth, among a weak and degenerate race of beings.
 <CARDINAL>Five</CARDINAL> causes of the growth of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> Our curiosity is naturally prompted to inquire by what means the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith obtained so remarkable a victory over the established religions of the earth.
 To this inquiry an obvious but unsatisfactory answer may be returned; that it was owing to the convincing evidence of the doctrine itself, and to the ruling providence of its great Author.
 But as truth and reason seldom find so favourable a reception in the world, and as the wisdom of <GPE>Providence</GPE> frequently condescends to use the passions of the human heart, and the general circumstances of mankind, as instruments to execute its purpose, we may still be permitted, though with becoming submission, to ask, not indeed what were the first, but what were the <ORDINAL>secondary</ORDINAL> causes of the rapid growth of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> church? It will, perhaps, appear that it was most effectually favoured and assisted by the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> following causes:I.
 The inflexible, and, if we may use the expression, the intolerant zeal of the Christians, derived, it is true, from the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> religion, but purified from the narrow and unsocial spirit which, instead of inviting, had deterred the <NORP>Gentiles</NORP> from embracing the law of Moses.
 II.
 The doctrine of a future life, improved by every additional circumstance which could give weight and efficacy to that important truth.
 III.
The miraculous powers ascribed to the primitive church.
 IV.
 The pure and austere morals of the Christians.
 V.
 The union and discipline of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> republic, which gradually formed an independent and increasing state in the heart of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 I.
 THE FIRST CAUSE Zeal of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> We have already described the religious harmony of the ancient world, and the facility with which the most different and even hostile nations embraced, or at least respected, each other's superstitions.
 A single people refused to join in the common intercourse of mankind.
 The Jews, who, under the <NORP>Assyrian</NORP> and <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarchies, had languished for many ages the most despised portion of their slaves, (1) emerged from obscurity under the successors of Alexander; and as they multiplied to a surprising degree in the East, and afterwards in the West, they soon excited the curiosity and wonder of other nations.
 (2) The sullen obstinacy with which they maintained their peculiar rites and unsocial manners seemed to mark them out a distinct species of men, who boldly professed, or who faintly disguised, their implacable hatred to the rest of humankind.
 (3) Neither the violence of Antiochus, nor the arts of Herod, nor the example of the circumjacent nations, could ever persuade the <NORP>Jews</NORP> to associate with the institutions of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> the elegant mythology of the Greeks.
 (4) According to the maxims of universal toleration, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> protected a superstition which they despised.
 (5) The polite <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> condescended to give orders that sacrifices should be offered for his prosperity in the temple of Jerusalem; (6) while the meanest of the posterity of Abraham, who should have paid the same homage to the <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> of the Capitol, would have been an object of abhorrence to himself and to his brethren.
 But the moderation of the conquerors was insufficient to appease the jealous prejudices of their subjects, who were alarmed and scandalised at the ensigns of paganism, which necessarily introduced themselves into a <NORP>Roman</NORP> province.
 (7) The mad attempt of <PERSON>Caligula</PERSON> to place his own statue in the temple of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> was defeated by the unanimous resolution of a people who dreaded death much less than such an idolatrous profanation.
 (8) Their attachment to the law of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> was equal to their detestation of foreign religions.
 The current of zeal and devotion, as it was contracted into a narrow channel, ran with the strength, and sometimes with the fury, of a torrent.
 Its gradual increase This inflexible perseverance, which appeared so odious or so ridiculous to the ancient world, assumes a more awful character, since <GPE>Providence</GPE> has deigned to reveal to us the mysterious history of the chosen people.
 But the devout and even scrupulous attachment to the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> religion, so conspicuous among the <NORP>Jews</NORP> who lived under the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> temple, becomes still more surprising if it is compared with the stubborn incredulity of their forefathers.
 When the law was given in thunder from Mount Sinai; when the tides of the ocean and the course of the planets were suspended for the convenience of the Israelites; and when temporal rewards and punishments were the immediate consequences of their piety or disobedience, they perpetually relapsed into rebellion against the visible majesty of their Divine King, placed the idols of the nations in the sanctuary of Jehovah, and imitated every fantastic ceremony that was practised in the tents of the Arabs, or in the cities of Phoenicia.
 (9) As the protection of Heaven was deservedly withdrawn from the ungrateful race, their faith acquired a proportionable degree of vigour and purity.
 The contemporaries of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and <PERSON>Joshua</PERSON> had beheld with careless indifference the most amazing miracles.
 Under the pressure of every calamity, the belief of those miracles has preserved the <NORP>Jews</NORP> of a later period from the universal contagion of idolatry; and in contradiction to every known principle of the human mind, that singular people seems to have yielded a stronger and more ready assent to the traditions of their remote ancestors than to the evidence of their own senses.
 (10) Their religion better suited to defence rather than to conquest The <NORP>Jewish</NORP> religion was admirably fitted for defence, but it was never designed for conquest; and it seems probable that the number of proselytes was never much superior to that of apostates.
 The divine promises were originally made, and the distinguishing rite of circumcision was enjoined, to a single family.
 When the posterity of <PERSON>Abraham</PERSON> had multiplied like the sands of the sea, the Deity, from whose mouth they received a system of laws and ceremonies, declared himself the proper and as it were the national God of Israel; and with the most jealous care separated his favourite people from the rest of mankind.
 The conquest of the land of <GPE>Canaan</GPE> was accompanied with so many wonderful and with so many bloody circumstances, that the victorious <NORP>Jews</NORP> were left in a state of irreconcilable hostility with all their neighbours.
 They had been commanded to extirpate some of the most idolatrous tribes, and the execution of the Divine will had seldom been retarded by the weakness of humanity.
 With the other nations they were forbidden to contract any marriages or alliances; and the prohibition of receiving them into the congregation, which in some cases was perpetual, almost always extended to the third, to the seventh, or even to the <ORDINAL>tenth</ORDINAL> generation.
 The obligation of preaching to the <NORP>Gentiles</NORP> the faith of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> had never been inculcated as a precept of the law, nor were the <NORP>Jews</NORP> inclined to impose it on themselves as a voluntary duty.
 In the admission of new citizens that unsocial people was actuated by the selfish vanity of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> rather than by the generous policy of Rome.
 The descendants of <PERSON>Abraham</PERSON> were flattered by the opinion that they alone were the heirs of the covenant, and they were apprehensive of diminishing the value of their inheritance by sharing it too easily with the strangers of the earth.
 A larger acquaintance with mankind extended their knowledge without correcting their prejudices; and whenever the God of <GPE>Israel</GPE> acquired any new votaries, he was much more indebted to the inconstant humour of polytheism than to the active zeal of his own missionaries.
 (11) The religion of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> seems to be instituted for a particular country as well as for a single nation; and if a strict obedience had been paid to the order that every male, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> times in the year, should present himself before the Lord Jehovah, it would have been impossible that the <NORP>Jews</NORP> could ever have spread themselves beyond the narrow limits of the promised land.
 (12) That obstacle was indeed removed by the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem; but the most considerable part of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> religion was involved in its destruction; and the Pagans, who had long wondered at the strange report of an empty sanctuary, (13) were at a loss to discover what could be the object, or what could be the instruments, of a worship which was destitute of temples and of altars, of priests and of sacrifices.
 Yet even in their fallen state, the Jews, still asserting their lofty and exclusive privileges, shunned, instead of courting, the society of strangers.
 They still insisted with inflexible rigour on those parts of the law which it was in their power to practise.
 Their peculiar distinctions of days, of meats, and a variety of trivial though burdensome observances, were so many objects of disgust and aversion for the other nations, to whose habits and prejudices they were diametrically opposite.
 The painful and even dangerous rite of circumcision was alone capable of repelling a willing proselyte from the door of the synagogue.
 (14) More liberal zeal of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> Under these circumstances, <NORP>Christianity</NORP> offered itself to the world, armed with the strength of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> law, and delivered from the weight of its fetters.
 An exclusive zeal for the truth of religion and the unity of God was as carefully inculcated in the new as in the ancient system: and whatever was now revealed to mankind concerning the nature and designs of the Supreme Being was fitted to increase their reverence for that mysterious doctrine.
 The divine authority of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and the prophets was admitted, and even established, as the firmest basis of Christianity.
 From the beginning of the world an uninterrupted series of predictions had announced and prepared the long expected coming of the Messiah, who, in compliance with the gross apprehensions of the Jews, had been more frequently represented under the character of a King and Conqueror, than under that of a Prophet, a Martyr, and the Son of God.
 By his expiatory sacrifice the imperfect sacrifices of the temple were at once consummated and abolished.
 The ceremonial law, which consisted only of types and figures, was succeeded by a pure and spiritual worship, equally adapted to all climates, as well as to every condition of mankind; and to the initiation of blood, was substituted a more harmless initiation of water.
 The promise of divine favour, instead of being partially confined to the posterity of Abraham, was universally proposed to the freeman and the slave, to the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> and to the barbarian, to the <NORP>Jew</NORP> and to the Gentile.
 Every privilege that could raise the proselyte from earth to heaven, that could exalt his devotion, secure his happiness, or even gratify that secret pride which, under the semblance of devotion, insinuates itself into the human heart, was still reserved for the members of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> church; but at the same time all mankind was permitted, and even solicited, to accept the glorious distinction, which was not only proffered as a favour, but imposed as an obligation.
 It became the most sacred duty of a new convert to diffuse among his friends and relations the inestimable blessing which he had received, and to warn them against a refusal that would be severely punished as a criminal disobedience to the will of a benevolent but all powerful Deity.
 Obstinancy and reasons of the believing <NORP>Jews</NORP> The enfranchisement of the church from the bonds of the synagogue was a work, however, of some time and of some difficulty.
 The <NORP>Jewish</NORP> converts, who acknowledged <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> in the character of the <PERSON>Messiah</PERSON> foretold by their ancient oracles, respected him as a prophetic teacher of virtue and religion; but they obstinately adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors, and were desirous of imposing them on the Gentiles, who continually augmented the number of believers.
 These <NORP>Judaising</NORP> <NORP>Christians</NORP> seem to have argued with some degree of plausibility from the Divine origin of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> law, and from the immutable perfections of its great Author.
 They affirmed, that, if the Being who is the same through all eternity had designed to abolish those sacred rites which had served to distinguish his chosen people, the repeal of them would have been no less clear and solemn than their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> promulgation: that, instead of those frequent declarations which either suppose or assert the perpetuity of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> religion, it would have been represented as a provisionary scheme intended to last only till the coming of the Messiah, who should instruct mankind in a more perfect mode of faith and of worship: (15) that the <PERSON>Messiah</PERSON> himself, and his disciples who conversed with him on earth, instead of authorising by their example the most minute observances of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> law, (16) would have published to the world the abolition of those useless and obsolete ceremonies, without suffering <NORP>Christianity</NORP> to remain during so many years obscurely confounded among the sects of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> church.
 Arguments like these appear to have been used in the defence of the expiring cause of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> law; but the industry of our learned divines has abundantly explained the ambiguous language of the Old Testament, and the ambiguous conduct of the apostolic teachers.
 It was proper gradually to unfold the system of the Gospel, and to pronounce with the utmost caution and tenderness a sentence of condemnation so repugnant to the inclination and prejudices of the believing Jews.
 The <NORP>Nazarene</NORP> church of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> The history of the church of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> affords a lively proof of the necessity of those precautions, and of the deep impression which the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> religion had made on the minds of its sectaries.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> bishops of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> were all circumcised Jews; and the congregation over which they presided united the law of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> with the doctrine of Christ.
 (17) It was natural that the primitive tradition of a church which was founded only forty days after the death of Christ, and was governed almost as many years under the immediate inspection of his apostle, should be received as the standard of orthodoxy.
 (18) The distant churches very frequently appealed to the authority of their venerable Parent, and relieved her distresses by a liberal contribution of alms.
 But when numerous and opulent societies were established in the great cities of the empire, in Antioch, Alexandria, Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome, the reverence which <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> had inspired to all the <NORP>Christian</NORP> colonies insensibly diminished.
 The <NORP>Jewish</NORP> converts, or, as they were afterwards called, the Nazarenes, who had laid the foundations of the church, soon found themselves overwhelmed by the increasing multitudes that from all the various religions of polytheism enlisted under the banner of Christ: and the Gentiles, who, with the approbation of their peculiar apostle, had rejected the intolerable weight of <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> ceremonies, at length refused to their more scrupulous brethren the same toleration which at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> they had humbly solicited for their own practice.
 The ruin of the temple, of the city, and of the public religion of the Jews, was severely felt by the Nazarenes; as in their manners, though not in their faith, they maintained so intimate a connection with their impious countrymen, whose misfortunes were attributed by the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> to the contempt, and more justly ascribed by the <NORP>Christians</NORP> to the wrath, of the Supreme Deity.
 The <PERSON>Nazarenes</PERSON> retired from the ruins of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> to the little town of <GPE>Pella</GPE> beyond the Jordan, where that ancient church languished above sixty years in solitude and obscurity.
 (19) They still enjoyed the comfort of making frequent and devout visits to the Holy City, and the hope of being <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day restored to those seats which both nature and religion taught them to love as well as to revere.
 But at length, under the reign of Hadrian, the desperate fanaticism of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> filled up the measure of their calamities; and the Romans, exasperated by their repeated rebellions, exercised the rights of victory with unusual rigour.
 The emperor founded, under the name of Alia Capitolina, a new city on Mount Sion, (20) to which he gave the privileges of a colony; and denouncing the severest penalties against any of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> people who should dare to approach its precincts, he fixed a vigilant garrison of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> cohort to enforce the execution of his orders.
 The <PERSON>Nazarenes</PERSON> had only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> way left to escape the common proscription, and the force of truth was on this occasion assisted by the influence of temporal advantages.
 They elected <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> for their bishop, a prelate of the race of the Gentiles, and most probably a native either of <GPE>Italy</GPE> or of some of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> provinces.
 At his persuasion the most considerable part of the congregation renounced the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> law, in the practice of which they had persevered above a century.
 By this sacrifice of their habits and prejudices they purchased a free admission into the colony of Hadrian, and more firmly cemented their union with the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church.
 (21) The <NORP>Ebionites</NORP> When the name and honours of the church of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> had been restored to Mount Sion, the crimes of heresy and schism were imputed to the obscure remnant of the <PERSON>Nazarenes</PERSON> which refused to accompany their <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> bishop.
 They still preserved their former habitation of Pella, spread themselves into the villages adjacent to Damascus, and formed an inconsiderable church in the city of Bercea, or, as it is now called, of Aleppo, in Syria.
 (22) The name of <PERSON>Nazarenes</PERSON> was deemed too honourable for those <NORP>Christian</NORP> Jews, and they soon received, from the supposed poverty of their understanding, as well as of their condition, the contemptuous epithet of Ebionites.
 (23) In a few years after the return of the church of Jerusalem, it became a matter of doubt and controversy whether a man who sincerely acknowledged <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> as the Messiah, but who still continued to observe the law of Moses, could possibly hope for salvation.
 The humane temper of <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> Martyr inclined him to answer this question in the affirmative; and though he expressed himself with the most guarded diffidence, he ventured to determine in favour of such an imperfect Christian, if he were content to practise the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> ceremonies without pretending to assert their general use or necessity.
 But when <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> was pressed to declare the sentiment of the church, he confessed that there were very many among the orthodox <NORP>Christians</NORP> who not only excluded their <NORP>Judaising</NORP> brethren from the hope of salvation, but who declined any intercourse with them in the common offices of friendship, hospitality, and social life.
 (24) The more rigorous opinion prevailed, as it was natural to expect, over the milder; and an eternal bar of separation was fixed between the disciples of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and those of Christ.
 The unfortunate Ebionites, rejected from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> religion as apostates, and from the other as heretics, found themselves compelled to assume a more decided character; and although some traces of that obsolete sect may be discovered as late as the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> century, they insensibly melted away either into the church or the synagogue.
 (25) The <NORP>Gnostics</NORP> While the orthodox church preserved a just medium between excessive veneration and improper contempt for the law of Moses, the various heretics deviated into equal but opposite extremes of error and extravagance.
 From the acknowledged truth of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> religion, the <NORP>Ebionites</NORP> had concluded that it could never be abolished.
 From its supposed imperfections, the <NORP>Gnostics</NORP> as hastily inferred that it never was instituted by the wisdom of the Deity.
 There are some objections against the authority of <PERSON>Moses</PERSON> and the prophets which too readily present themselves to the sceptical mind; though they can only be derived from our ignorance of remote antiquity, and from our incapacity to form an adequate judgment of the Divine economy.
 These objections were eagerly embraced and as petulantly urged by the vain science of the Gnostics.
 (26) As those heretics were, for the most part, averse to the pleasures of sense, they morosely arraigned the polygamy of the patriarchs, the gallantries of David, and the seraglio of Solomon.
 The conquest of the land of Canaan, and the extirpation of the unsuspecting natives, they were at a loss how to reconcile with the common notions of humanity and justice.
 But when they recollected the sanguinary list of murders, of executions, and of massacres, which stain almost every page of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> annals, they acknowledged that the barbarians of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> had exercised as much compassion towards their idolatrous enemies as they had ever shown to their friends or countrymen.
 (27) Passing from the sectaries of the law itself, they asserted that it was impossible that a religion which consisted only of bloody sacrifices and trifling ceremonies, and whose rewards as well as punishments were all of a carnal and temporal nature, could inspire the love of virtue, or restrain the impetuosity of passion.
 The <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> account of the creation and fall of man was treated with profane derision by the Gnostics, who would not listen with patience to the repose of the <PERSON>Deity</PERSON> after <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days labour, to the rib of Adam, the garden of Eden, the trees of life and of knowledge, the speaking serpent, the forbidden fruit, and the condemnation pronounced against human kind for the venial offence of their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> progenitors.
 (28) The God of <GPE>Israel</GPE> was impiously represented by the <NORP>Gnostics</NORP> as a being liable to passion and to error, capricious in his favour, implacable in his resentment, meanly jealous of his superstitious worship, and confining his partial providence to a single people, and to this transitory life.
 In such a character they could discover none of the features of the wise and omnipotent Father of the universe.
 (29) They allowed that the religion of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> was somewhat less criminal than the idolatry of the Gentiles: but it was their fundamental doctrine that the <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> whom they adored as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and brightest emanation of the <PERSON>Deity</PERSON> appeared upon earth to rescue mankind from their various errors, and to reveal a new system of truth and perfection.
 The most learned of the fathers, by a very singular condescension, have imprudently admitted the sophistry of the Gnostics.
 Acknowledging that the literal sense is repugnant to every principle of faith as well as reason, they deem themselves secure and invulnerable behind the ample veil of allegory, which they carefully spread over every tender part of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> dispensation.
 (30) Their sects, progress and influence It has been remarked with more ingenuity than truth that the virgin purity of the church was never violated by schism or heresy before the reign of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> or Hadrian, about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred years after the death of Christ.
 (31) We may observe with much more propriety that, during that period, the disciples of the <PERSON>Messiah</PERSON> were indulged in a freer latitude both of faith and practice than has ever been allowed in succeeding ages.
 As the terms of communion were insensibly narrowed, and the spiritual authority of the prevailing party was exercised with increasing severity, many of its most respectable adherents, who were called upon to renounce, were provoked to assert their private opinions, to pursue the consequences of their mistaken principles, and openly to erect the standard of rebellion against the unity of the church.
 The <NORP>Gnostics</NORP> were distinguished as the most polite, the most learned, and the most wealthy of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> name; and that general appellation, which expressed a superiority of knowledge, was either assumed by their own pride, or ironically bestowed by the envy of their adversaries.
 They were almost without exception of the race of the Gentiles, and their principal founders seem to have been natives of <GPE>Syria</GPE> or Egypt, where the warmth of the climate disposes both the mind and the body to indolent and contemplative devotion.
 The <NORP>Gnostics</NORP> blended with the faith of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> many sublime but obscure tenets, which they derived from oriental philosophy, and even from the religion of Zoroaster, concerning the eternity of matter, the existence of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> principles, and the mysterious hierarchy of the invisible world.
 (32) As soon as they launched out into that vast abyss, they delivered themselves to the guidance of a disordered imagination; and as the paths of error are various and infinite, the <NORP>Gnostics</NORP> were imperceptibly divided into more than <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> particular sects, (33) of whom the most celebrated appear to have been the Basilidians, the Valentinians, the Marcionites, and, in a still later period, the Manichaeans.
 Each of these sects could boast of its bishops and congregations, of its doctors and martyrs; (34) and, instead of the <CARDINAL>Four</CARDINAL> Gospels adopted by the church the heretics produced a multitude of histories in which the actions and discourses of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and of his apostles were adapted to their respective tenets.
 (35) The success of the <NORP>Gnostics</NORP> was rapid and extensive.
 (36) They covered <LOC>Asia</LOC> and Egypt, established themselves in Rome, and sometimes penetrated into the provinces of the West.
 For the most part they arose in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> century, flourished during the third, and were suppressed in the <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> or fifth, by the prevalence of more fashionable controversies, and by the superior ascendant of the reigning power.
 Though they constantly disturbed the peace, and frequently disgraced the name of religion, they contributed to assist rather than to retard the progress of Christianity.
 The <NORP>Gentile</NORP> converts, whose strongest objections and prejudices were directed against the law of Moses, could find admission into many <NORP>Christian</NORP> societies, which required not from their untutored mind any belief of an antecedent revelation.
 Their faith was insensibly fortified and enlarged, and the church was ultimately benefited by the conquests of its most inveterate enemies.
 (37) The daemons considered as the gods of antiquity But whatever difference of opinion might subsist between the Orthodox, the Ebionites, and the Gnostics, concerning the divinity or the obligation of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> law, they were all equally animated by the same exclusive zeal, and by the same abhorrence for idolatry, which had distinguished the <NORP>Jews</NORP> from the other nations of the ancient world.
 The philosopher, who considered the system of polytheism as a composition of human fraud and error, could disguise a smile of contempt under the mask of devotion, without apprehending that either the mockery or the compliance would expose him to the resentment of any invisible, or, as he conceived them, imaginary powers.
 But the established religions of <NORP>Paganism</NORP> were seen by the primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> in a much more odious and formidable light.
 It was the universal sentiment both of the church and of heretics, that the daemons were the authors, the patrons, and the objects of idolatry.
 (38) Those rebellious spirits who had been degraded from the rank of angels, and cast down into the infernal pit, were still permitted to roam upon earth, to torment the bodies and to seduce the minds of sinful men.
 The daemons soon discovered and abused the natural propensity of the human heart towards devotion and, artfully withdrawing the adoration of mankind from their Creator, they usurped the place and honours of the Supreme Deity.
 By the success of their malicious contrivances, they at once gratified their own vanity and revenge, and obtained the only comfort of which they were yet susceptible, the hope of involving the human species in the participation of their guilt and misery.
 It was confessed, or at least it was imagined, that they had distributed among themselves the most important characters of polytheism, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> daemon assuming the name and attributes of Jupiter, another of Aesculapius, a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> of Venus, and a <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> perhaps of Apollo; (39) and that, by the advantage of their long experience and aerial nature, they were enabled to execute, with sufficient skill and dignity, the parts which they had undertaken.
 They lurked in the temples, instituted festivals and sacrifices, invented fables, pronounced oracles, and were frequently allowed to perform miracles.
 The Christians, who, by the interposition of evil spirits, could so readily explain every preternatural appearance, were disposed and even desirous to admit the most extravagant fictions of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> mythology.
 But the belief of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> was accompanied with horror.
 The most trifling mark of respect to the national worship he considered as a direct homage yielded to the daemon, and as an act of rebellion against the majesty of God.
 Abhorrence of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> for idoltary In consequence of this opinion, it was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> but arduous duty of a <NORP>Christian</NORP> to preserve himself pure and undefiled by the practice of idolatry.
 The religion of the nations was not merely a speculative doctrine professed in the schools or preached in the temples.
 The innumerable deities and rites of polytheism were closely interwoven with every circumstance of business or pleasure, of public or of private life, and it seemed impossible to escape the observance of them, without, at the same time, renouncing the commerce of mankind, and all the offices and amusements of society.
 (40)Ceremonies The important transactions of peace and war were prepared or concluded by solemn sacrifices, in which the magistrate, the senator, and the soldier were obliged to preside or to participate.
 (41) The public spectacles were an essential part of the cheerful devotion of the Pagans, and the gods were supposed to accept, as the most grateful offering, the games that the prince and people celebrated in honour of their peculiar festivals.
 (42) The Christian, who with pious horror avoided the abomination of the circus or the theatre, found himself encompassed with infernal snares in every convivial entertainment, as often as his friends, invoking the hospitable deities, poured out libations to each others happiness.
 (43) When the bride, struggling with well affected reluctance, was forced in hymenal pomp over the threshold of her new habitation, (44) or when the sad procession of the dead slowly moved towards the funeral pile, (45) the Christian, on these interesting occasions, was compelled to desert the persons who were the dearest to him, rather than contract the guilt inherent to those impious ceremonies.
 ArtsEvery art and every trade that was in the least concerned in the framing or adorning of idols was polluted by the stain of idolatry; (46) a severe sentence, since it devoted to eternal misery the far greater part of the community which is employed in the exercise of liberal or mechanic professions.
 If we cast our eyes over the numerous remains of antiquity we shall perceive that, besides the immediate representations of the gods and the holy instruments of their worship, the elegant forms and agreeable fictions consecrated by the imagination of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were introduced as the richest ornaments of the houses, the dress, and the furniture of the Pagans.
 (47) Even the arts of music and painting of eloquence and poetry, flowed from the same impure origin.
 In the style of the fathers, <LOC>Apollo</LOC> and the Muses were the organs of the infernal spirit; <PERSON>Homer</PERSON> and <PERSON>Virgil</PERSON> were the most eminent of his servants; and the beautiful mythology which pervades and animates the compositions of their genius is destined to celebrate the glory of the daemons.
 Even the common language of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and <GPE>Rome</GPE> abounded with familiar but impious expressions, which the imprudent <NORP>Christian</NORP> might too carelessly utter, or too patiently hear.
 (48) Festivals The dangerous temptations which on every side lurked in ambush to surprise the unguarded believer assailed him with redoubled violence on the days of solemn festivals.
 So artfully were they framed and disposed throughout the year, that superstition always wore the appearance of pleasure, and often of virtue.
 (49) Some of the most sacred festivals in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> ritual were destined to salute the new calends of <DATE>January</DATE> with vows of public and private felicity; to indulge the pious remembrance of the dead and living to ascertain the inviolable bounds of property; to hail, on the return of spring, the genial powers of fecundity; to perpetuate the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> memorable eras of Rome, the foundation of the city, and that of the republic; and to restore, during the humane licence of the Saturnalia, the primitive equality of mankind.
 Some idea may be conceived of the abhorrence of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> for such impious ceremonies, by the scrupulous delicacy which they displayed on a much less alarming occasion.
 On days of general festivity it was the custom of the ancients to adorn their doors with lamps and with branches of laurel, and to crown their heads with a garland of flowers.
 This innocent and elegant practice might perhaps have been tolerated as a mere civil institution.
 But it most unluckily happened that the doors were under the protection of the household gods, that the laurel was sacred to the lover of Daphne, and that garlands of flowers, though frequently worn as a symbol either of joy or mourning, had been dedicated in their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> origin to the service of superstition.
 The trembling Christians, who were persuaded in this instance to comply with the fashion of their country and the commands of the magistrate, laboured under the most gloomy apprehensions, from the reproaches of their own conscience, the censures of the church, and the denunciations of divine vengeance.
 (50) Zeal for <NORP>Christianity</NORP> Such was the anxious diligence which was required to guard the chastity of the <LOC>Gospel</LOC> from the infectious breath of idolatry.
 The superstitious observances of public or private rites were carelessly practised, from education and habit, by the followers of the established religion.
 But as often as they occurred, they afforded the <NORP>Christians</NORP> an opportunity of declaring and confirming their zealous opposition.
 By these frequent protestations their attachment to the faith was continually fortified; and in proportion to the increase of zeal, they combated with the more ardour and success in the holy war which they had undertaken against the empire of the daemons.
 II.
 THE SECOND CAUSE The doctrine of the immortality of the soul among the philosophers The writings of <PERSON>Cicero</PERSON> (51) represent in the most lively colours the ignorance, the errors, and the uncertainty of the ancient philosophers with regard to the immortality of the soul.
 When they are desirous of arming their disciples against the fear of death, they inculcate, as an obvious though melancholy position, that the fatal stroke of our dissolution releases us from the calamities of life; and that those can no longer suffer who no longer exist.
 Yet there were a few sages of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and <GPE>Rome</GPE> who had conceived a more exalted, and, in some respects, a juster idea of human nature, though it must be confessed that, in the sublime inquiry, their reason had been often guided by their imagination, and that their imagination had been prompted by their vanity.
 When they viewed with complacency the extent of their own mental powers, when they exercised the various faculties of memory, of fancy, and of judgment, in the most profound speculations or the most important labours, and when they reflected on the desire of fame, which transported them into future ages, far beyond the bounds of death and of the grave, they were unwilling to confound themselves with the beasts of the field, or to suppose that a being, for whose dignity they entertained the most sincere admiration, could be limited to a spot of earth, and to a few years of duration.
 With this favourable prepossession they summoned to their aid the science, or rather the language, of Metaphysics.
 They soon discovered that, as none of the properties of matter will apply to the operations of the mind, the human soul must consequently be a substance distinct from the body, pure, simple, and spiritual, incapable of dissolution, and susceptible of a much higher degree of virtue and happiness after the release from its corporeal prison.
 From these specious and noble principles the philosophers who trod in the footsteps of <PERSON>Plato</PERSON> deduced a very unjustifiable conclusion, since they asserted, not only the future immortality, but the past eternity of the human soul, which they were too apt to consider as a portion of the infinite and self-existing spirit which pervades and sustains the universe.
 (52) A doctrine thus removed beyond the senses and the experience of mankind might serve to amuse the leisure of a philosophic mind; or, in the silence of solitude, it might sometimes impart a ray of comfort to desponding virtue; but the faint impression which had been received in the schools was soon obliterated by the commerce and business of active life.
 We are sufficiently acquainted with the eminent persons who flourished in the age of <PERSON>Cicero</PERSON> and of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Caesars, with their actions, their characters, and their motives, to be assured that their conduct in this life was never regulated by any serious conviction of the rewards or punishments of a future state.
 At the bar and in the senate of <GPE>Rome</GPE> the ablest orators were not apprehensive of giving offence to their hearers by exposing that doctrine as an idle and extravagant opinion, which was rejected with contempt by every man of a liberal education and understanding.
 (53) among the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Rome; Since therefore the most sublime efforts of philosophy can extend no farther than feebly to point out the desire, the hope, or, at most, the probability of a future state, there is nothing, except a divine revelation that can ascertain the existence and describe the condition of the invisible country which is destined to receive the souls of men after their separation from the body.
 But we may perceive several defects inherent to the popular religions of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and <GPE>Rome</GPE> which rendered them very unequal to so arduous a task.
 <CARDINAL>1</CARDINAL> The general system of their mythology was unsupported by any solid proofs; and the wisest among the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> had already disclaimed its usurped authority.
 <CARDINAL>2</CARDINAL> The description of the infernal regions had been abandoned to the fancy of painters and of poets, who peopled them with so many phantoms and monsters who dispensed their rewards and punishments with so little equity, that a solemn truth, the most congenial to the human heart, was oppressed and disgraced by the absurd mixture of the wildest fictions.
 (54) <CARDINAL>3</CARDINAL> The doctrine of a future state was scarcely considered among the devout polytheists of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and <GPE>Rome</GPE> as a fundamental article of faith.
 The providence of the gods, as it related to public communities rather than to private individuals, was principally displayed on the visible theatre of the present world.
 The petitions which were offered on the altars of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> or <LOC>Apollo</LOC> expressed the anxiety of their worshippers for temporal happiness, and their ignorance or indifference concerning a future life.
 (55) The important truth of the immortality of the soul was inculcated with more diligence as well as success in India, in Assyria, in Egypt, and in Gaul; among the barbarians; and since we cannot attribute such a difference to the superior knowledge of the barbarians, we must ascribe it to the influence of an established priesthood, which employed the motives of virtue as the instrument of ambition.
 (56) among the Jews; We might naturally expect that a principle so essential to religion would have been revealed in the clearest terms to the chosen people of Palestine, and that it might safely have been intrusted to the hereditary priesthood of Aaron.
 It is incumbent on us to adore the mysterious dispensations of Providence, (57) when we discover that the doctrine of the immortality of the soul is omitted in the law of Moses; it is darkly insinuated by the prophets; and during the long period which elapsed between the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> and the <NORP>Babylonian</NORP> servitudes, the hopes as well as fears of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> appear to have been confined within the narrow compass of the present life.
 (58) After <PERSON>Cyrus</PERSON> had permitted the exiled nation to return into the promised land, and after <PERSON>Ezra</PERSON> had restored the ancient records of their religion, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> celebrated sects, the <NORP>Sadducees</NORP> and the Pharisees, insensibly arose at Jerusalem.
 (59) The former, selected from the more opulent and distinguished ranks of society, were strictly attached to the literal sense of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> law, and they piously rejected the immortality of the soul as an opinion that received no countenance from the divine book, which they revered as the only rule of their faith.
 To the authority of <WORK_OF_ART>Scripture</WORK_OF_ART> the <NORP>Pharisees</NORP> added that of tradition, and they accepted, under the name of traditions, several speculative tenets from the philosophy or religion of the eastern nations.
 The doctrines of fate or predestination, of angels and spirits, and of a future state of rewards and punishments, were in the number of these new articles of belief; and as the Pharisees, by the austerity of their manners, had drawn into their party the body of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> people, the immortality of the soul became the prevailing sentiment of the synagogue under the reign of the <NORP>Asmonaean</NORP> princes and pontiffs.
 The temper of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> was incapable of contenting itself with such a cold and languid assent as might satisfy the mind of a Polytheist; and as soon as they admitted the idea of a future state, they embraced it with the zeal which has always formed the characteristic of the nation.
 Their zeal, however, added nothing to its evidence, or even probability; and it was still necessary that the doctrine of life and immortality, which had been dictated by nature, approved by reason, and received by superstition, should obtain the sanction of divine truth from the authority and example of Christ.
 among the <NORP>Christians</NORP> When the promise of eternal happiness was proposed to mankind on condition of adopting the faith, and of observing the precepts, of the Gospel, it is no wonder that so advantageous an offer should have been accepted by great numbers of every religion, of every rank, and of every province in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The ancient <NORP>Christians</NORP> were animated by a contempt for their present existence, and by a just confidence of immortality, of which the doubtful and imperfect faith of modern ages cannot give us any adequate notion.
 Approaching end of the world.
 In the primitive church the influence of truth was very powerfully strengthened by an opinion which, however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, has not been found agreeable to experience.
 It was universally believed that the end of the world, and the kingdom of heaven, were at hand.
 The near approach of this wonderful event had been predicted by the apostles; the tradition of it was preserved by their earliest disciples, and those who understood in their literal sense the discourses of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> himself were obliged to expect the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and glorious coming of the Son of Man in the clouds, before that generation was totally extinguished which had beheld his humble condition upon earth, and which might still be witness of the calamities of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> under <NORP>Vespasian</NORP> or Hadrian.
 The revolution of <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> centuries has instructed us not to press too closely the mysterious language of prophecy and revelation; but as long as, for wise purposes, this error was permitted to subsist in the church, it was productive of the most salutary effects on the faith and practice of Christians, who lived in the awful expectation of that moment when the globe itself, and all the various race of mankind, should tremble at the appearance of their divine Judge.
 (60) Doctrine of the Millenium.
 The ancient and popular doctrine of the <WORK_OF_ART>Millennium</WORK_OF_ART> was intimately connected with the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> coming of Christ.
 As the works of the creation had been finished in <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> days, their duration in their present state, according to a tradition which was attributed to the prophet Elijah, was fixed to <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> thousand years.
 (61) By the same analogy it was inferred that this long period of labour and contention, which was now almost elapsed, (62) would be succeeded by a joyful Sabbath of a thousand years; and that Christ, with the triumphant band of the saints and the elect who had escaped death, or who had been miraculously revived, would reign upon earth till the time appointed for the last and general resurrection.
 So pleasing was this hope to the mind of believers, that the new Jerusalem, the seat of this blissful kingdom, was quickly adorned with all the gayest colours of the imagination.
 A felicity consisting only of pure and spiritual pleasure would have appeared too refined for its inhabitants, who were still supposed to possess their human nature and senses.
 A garden of Eden, with the amusements of the pastoral life, was no longer suited to the advanced state of society which prevailed under the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 A city was therefore erected of gold and precious stones, and a supernatural plenty of corn and wine was bestowed on the adjacent territory; in the free enjoyment of whose spontaneous productions the happy and benevolent people was never to be restrained by any jealous laws of exclusive property.
 (63) The assurance of such a <WORK_OF_ART>Millennium</WORK_OF_ART> was carefully inculcated by a succession of fathers from <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> Martyr (64) and Irenaeus, who conversed with the immediate disciples of the apostles, down to Lactantius, who was preceptor to the son of Constantine.
 (65) Though it might not be universally received, it appears to have been the reigning sentiment of the orthodox believers; and it seems so well adapted to the desires and apprehensions of mankind, that it must have contributed in a very considerable degree to the progress of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> faith.
 But when the edifice of the church was almost completed, the temporary support was laid aside.
 The doctrine of Christ's reign upon earth was at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> treated as a profound allegory, was considered by degrees as a doubtful and useless opinion, and was at length rejected as the absurd invention of heresy and fanaticism.
 (66) A mysterious prophecy, which still forms a part of the sacred canon, but which was thought to favour the exploded sentiment, has very narrowly escaped the proscription of the church.
 (67) Conflagration of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and of the world Whilst the happiness and glory of a temporal reign were promised to the disciples of Christ, the most dreadful calamities were denounced against an unbelieving world.
 The edification of the new <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> was to advance by equal steps with the destruction of the mystic Babylon; and as long as the emperors who reigned before <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> persisted in the profession of idolatry, the epithet of <GPE>Babylon</GPE> was applied to the city and to the empire of Rome.
 A regular series was prepared of all the moral and physical evils which can afflict a flourishing nation; intestine discord, and the invasion of the fiercest barbarians from the unknown regions of the North; pestilence and famine, comets and eclipses, earthquakes and inundations.
 (68) All these were only so many preparatory and alarming signs of the great catastrophe of Rome, when the country of the <NORP>Scipios</NORP> and <ORG>Caesars</ORG> should be consumed by a flame from Heaven, and the city of the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hills, with her palaces, her temples, and her triumphal arches, should be buried in a vast lake of fire and brimstone.
 It might, however, afford some consolation to <NORP>Roman</NORP> vanity, that the period of their empire would be that of the world itself; which as it had once perished by the element of water, was destined to experience a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and a speedy destruction from the element of fire.
 In the opinion of a general conflagration the faith of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> very happily coincided with the tradition of the East, the philosophy of the Stoics, and the analogy of Nature; and even the country which, from religious motives, had been chosen for the origin and principal scene of the conflagration, was the best adapted for that purpose by natural and physical causes by its deep caverns, beds of sulphur, and numerous volcanoes, of which those of Etna, of Vesuvius, and of <GPE>Lipari</GPE> exhibit a very imperfect representation.
 The calmest and most intrepid sceptic could not refuse to acknowledge that the destruction of the present system of the world by fire was in itself extremely probable.
 The Christian, who founded his belief much less on the fallacious arguments of reason than on the authority of tradition and the interpretation of Scripture, expected it with terror and confidence as a certain and approaching event; and as his mind was perpetually filled with the solemn idea, he considered every disaster that happened to the empire as an infallible symptom of an expiring world.
 (69) The <NORP>Pagans</NORP> devoted to eternal punishment.
 The condemnation of the wisest and most virtuous of the Pagans, on account of their ignorance or disbelief of the divine truth, seems to offend the reason and the humanity of the present age.
 (70) But the primitive church, whose faith was of a much firmer consistence, delivered over, without hesitation, to eternal torture the far greater part of the human species.
 A charitable hope might perhaps be indulged in favour of Socrates, or some other sages of antiquity, who had consulted the light of reason before that of the <LOC>Gospel</LOC> had arisen.
 (71) But it was unanimously affirmed that those who, since the birth or the death of Christ, had obstinately persisted in the worship of the daemons, neither deserved nor could expect a pardon from the irritated justice of the Deity.
 These rigid sentiments, which had been unknown to the ancient world, appear to have infused a spirit of bitterness into a system of love and harmony.
 The ties of blood and friendship were frequently torn asunder by the difference of religious faith; and the Christians, who, in this world, found themselves oppressed by the power of the Pagans, were sometimes seduced by resentment and spiritual pride to delight in the prospect of their future triumph.
 But the humanity of the reader will permit me to draw a veil over the rest of this infernal description, which the zealous <NORP>African</NORP> pursues in a long variety of affected and unfeeling witticisms.
 (72) Were often converted by their fears.
 Doubtless there were many among the primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> of a temper more suitable to the meekness and charity of their profession.
 There were many who felt a sincere compassion for the danger of their friends and countrymen, and who exerted the most benevolent zeal to save them from the impending destruction.
 The careless Polytheist, assailed by new and unexpected terrors, against which neither his priests nor his philosophers could afford him any certain protection, was very frequently terrified and subdued by the menace of eternal tortures.
 His fears might assist the progress of his faith and reason; and if he could once persuade himself to suspect that the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion might possibly be true, it became an easy task to convince him that it was the safest and most prudent party that he could possibly embrace.
 III.
 THE THIRD CAUSE Miraculous powers of the primitive church.
 The supernatural gifts, which even in this life were ascribed to the <NORP>Christians</NORP> above the rest of mankind, must have conduced to their own comfort, and very frequently to the conviction of infidels.
 Besides the occasional prodigies, which might sometimes be effected by the immediate interposition of the <PERSON>Deity</PERSON> when he suspended the laws of <PERSON>Nature</PERSON> for the service of religion, the <NORP>Christian</NORP> church, from the time of the apostles and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> disciples, (73) has claimed an uninterrupted succession of miraculous powers, the gift of tongues, of vision, and of prophecy, the power of expelling daemons, of healing the sick, and of raising the dead.
 The knowledge of foreign languages was frequently communicated to the contemporaries of Irenaeus, though <PERSON>Irenecus</PERSON> himself was left to struggle with the difficulties of a barbarous dialect whilst he preached the <LOC>Gospel</LOC> to the natives of Gaul.
 (74) The divine inspiration, whether it was conveyed in the form of a waking or of a sleeping vision, is described as a favour very liberally bestowed on all ranks of the faithful, on women as on elders, on boys as well as upon bishops.
 When their devout minds were sufficiently prepared by a course of prayer, of fasting, and of vigils, to receive the extraordinary impulse, they were transported out of their senses, and delivered in ecstasy that was inspired, being mere organs of the Holy Spirit, just as a pipe or flute is of him who blows into it.
 (75) We may add that the design of these visions was, for the most part, either to disclose the future history, or to guide the present administration, of the church.
 The expulsion of the daemons from the bodies of those unhappy persons whom they had been permitted to torment was considered as a signal though ordinary triumph of religion, and is repeatedly alleged by the ancient apologists as the most convincing evidence of the truth of Christianity.
 The awful ceremony was usually performed in a public manner, and in the presence of a great number of spectators; the patient was relieved by the power or skill of the exorcist, and the vanquished daemon was heard to confess that he was <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the fabled gods of antiquity, who had impiously usurped the adoration of mankind.
 (76) But the miraculous cure of diseases of the most inveterate or even preternatural kind can no longer occasion any surprise, when we recollect that in the days of Irenaeus, about the end of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> century, the resurrection of the dead was very far from being esteemed an uncommon event; that the miracle was frequently performed on necessary occasions, by great fasting and the joint supplication of the church of the place, and that the persons thus restored to their prayers had lived afterwards among them many years.
 (77) At such a period, when faith could boast of so many wonderful victories over death, it seems difficult to account for the scepticism of those philosophers who still rejected and derided the doctrine of the resurrection.
 A noble <NORP>Grecian</NORP> had rested on this important ground the whole controversy, and promised Theophilus, bishop of Antioch, that, if he could be gratified with the sight of a single person who had been actually raised from the dead, he would immediately embrace the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion.
 It is somewhat remarkable that the prelate of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> eastern church, however anxious for the conversion of his friend, thought proper to decline this fair and reasonable challenge.
 (78) Their truth contested.
 The miracles of the primitive church, after obtaining the sanction of ages, have been lately attacked in a very free and ingenious inquiry (79) which, though it has met with the most favourable reception from the public, appears to have excited a general scandal among the divines of our own as well as of the other <NORP>Protestant</NORP> churches of Europe.
 (80) Our different sentiments on this subject will be much less influenced by any particular arguments than by our habits of study and reflection, and, above all, by the degree of the evidence which we have accustomed ourselves to require for the proof of a miraculous event.
 Our perplexity in defining the miraculous period.
 The duty of an historian does not call upon him to interpose his private judgment in this nice and important controversy; but he ought not to dissemble the difficulty of adopting such a theory as may reconcile the interest of religion with that of reason, of making a proper application of that theory, and of defining with precision the limits of that happy period, exempt from error and from deceit, to which we might be disposed to extend the gift of supernatural powers.
 From the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the fathers to the last of the popes, a succession of bishops, of saints, of martyrs, and of miracles, is continued without interruption; and the progress of superstition was so gradual and almost imperceptible, that we know not in what particular link we should break the chain of tradition.
 Every age bears testimony to the wonderful events by which it was distinguished, and its testimony appears no less weighty and respectable than that of the preceding generation, till we are insensibly led on to accuse our own inconsistency if, in the eighth or in the twelfth century, we deny to the venerable Bede, or to the holy Bernard, the same degree of confidence which, in the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> century, we had so liberally granted to <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> or to Irenaeus.
 (81) If the truth of any of those miracles is appreciated by their apparent use and propriety, every age had unbelievers to convince, heretics to confute, and idolatrous nations to convert; and sufficient motives might always be produced to justify the interposition of Heaven.
 And yet, since every friend to revelation is persuaded of the reality, and every reasonable man is convinced of the cessation, of miraculous powers, it is evident that there must have been some period in which they were either suddenly or gradually withdrawn from the <NORP>Christian</NORP> church.
 Whatever era is chosen for that purpose, the death of the apostles, the conversion of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, or the extinction of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> heresy, (82) the insensibility of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> who lived at that time will equally afford a just matter of surprise.
 They still supported their pretensions after they had lost their power.
 Credulity performed the office of faith; fanaticism was permitted to assume the language of inspiration, and the effects of accident or contrivance were ascribed to supernatural causes.
 The recent experience of genuine miracles should have instructed the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world in the ways of Providence, and habituated their eye (if we may use a very inadequate expression) to the style of the Divine artist.
 Should the most skilful painter of modern <GPE>Italy</GPE> presume to decorate his feeble imitations with the name of <PERSON>Raphael</PERSON> or of Correggio, the insolent fraud would be soon discovered and indignantly rejected.
 Use of the primitive miracles.
 Whatever opinion may be entertained of the miracles of the primitive church since the time of the apostles, this unresisting softness of temper, so conspicuous among the believers of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> centuries, proved of some accidental benefit to the cause of truth and religion.
 In modern times, a latent and even involuntary scepticism adheres to the most pious dispositions.
 Their admission of supernatural truths is much less an active consent than a cold and passive acquiescence.
 Accustomed long since to observe and to respect the invariable order of Nature, our reason, or at least our imagination, is not sufficiently prepared to sustain the visible action of the Deity.
 But in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> ages of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> the situation of mankind was extremely different.
 The most curious, or the most credulous, among the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> were often persuaded to enter into a society which asserted an actual claim of miraculous powers.
 The primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> perpetually trod on mystic ground, and their minds were exercised by the habits of believing the most extraordinary events.
 They felt, or they fancied, that on every side they were incessantly assaulted by daemons, comforted by visions, instructed by prophecy, and surprisingly delivered from danger, sickness, and from death itself, by the supplications of the church.
 The real or imaginary prodigies, of which they so frequently conceived themselves to be the objects, the instruments, or the spectators, very happily disposed them to adopt with the same ease, but with far greater justice, the authentic wonders of the evangelic history; and thus miracles that exceeded not the measure of their own experience inspired them with the most lively assurance of mysteries which were acknowledged to surpass the limits of their understanding.
 It is this deep impression of supernatural truths which has been so much celebrated under the name of faith; a state of mind described as the surest pledge of the Divine favour and of future felicity, and recommended as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> or perhaps the only merit of a Christian.
 According to the more rigid doctors, the moral virtues, which may be equally practised by infidels, are destitute of any value or efficacy in the work of our justification.
 IV.
THE FOURTH CAUSE Virtues of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Christians.
 But the primitive <NORP>Christian</NORP> demonstrated his faith by his virtues; and it was very justly supposed that the Divine persuasion, which enlightened or subdued the understanding, must at the same time purify the heart and direct the actions of the believer.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> apologists of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> who justify the innocence of their brethren, and the writers of a later period who celebrate the sanctity of their ancestors, display, in the most lively colours, the reformation of manners which was introduced into the world by the preaching of the Gospel.
 As it is my intention to remark only such human causes as were permitted to <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> the influence of revelation, I shall lightly mention <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> motives which might naturally render the lives of the primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> much purer and more austere than those of their <NORP>Pagan</NORP> contemporaries or their degenerate successors — repentance for their past sins, and the laudable desire of supporting the reputation of the society in which they were engaged.
 Effects of their repentance It is a very ancient reproach, suggested by the ignorance or the malice of infidelity, that the <NORP>Christians</NORP> allured into their party the most atrocious criminals, who, as soon as they were touched by a sense of remorse, were easily persuaded to wash away, in the water of baptism, the guilt of their past conduct, for which the temples of the gods refused to grant them any expiation.
 But this reproach, when it is cleared from misrepresentation, contributes as much to the honour as it did to the increase of the church.
 (83) The friends of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> may acknowledge without a blush that many of the most eminent saints had been before their baptism the most abandoned sinners.
 Those persons who in the world had followed, though in imperfect manner, the dictates of benevolence and propriety, derived such a calm satisfaction from the opinion of their own rectitude as rendered them much less susceptible of the sudden emotions of shame, of grief, and of terror, which have given birth to so many wonderful conversions.
 After the example of their Divine Master, the missionaries of the <LOC>Gospel</LOC> disdained not the society of men, and especially of women, oppressed by the consciousness, and very often by the effects, of their vices.
 As they merged from sin and superstition to the glorious hope of immortality, they resolved to devote themselves to a life, not only of virtue, but of penitence.
 The desire of perfection became the ruling passion of their soul; and it is well known that, while reason embraces a cold mediocrity, our passions hurry us with rapid violence over the space which lies between the most opposite extremes.
 Care of their reputation When the new converts had been enrolled in the number of the faithful, and were admitted to the sacraments of the church, they found themselves restrained from relapsing into their past disorders by another consideration of a less spiritual but of a very innocent and respectable nature.
 Any particular society that has departed from the great body of the nation, or the religion to which it belonged, immediately becomes the object of universal as well as invidious observation.
 In proportion to the smallness of its numbers, the character of the society may be affected by the virtue and vices of the persons who compose it; and every member is engaged to watch with the most vigilant attention over his own behaviour, and over that of his brethren, since, as he must expect to incur part of the common disgrace, he may hope to enjoy a share of the common reputation.
 When the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of <GPE>Bithynia</GPE> were brought before the tribunal of the younger Pliny, they assured the proconsul that, far from being engaged in any unlawful conspiracy, they were bound by a solemn obligation to abstain from the commission of those crimes which disturb the private or public peace of society, from theft, robbery, adultery, perjury, and fraud.
 (84) Near a century afterwards, <PERSON>Tertullian</PERSON> with an honest pride could boast that very few <NORP>Christians</NORP> had suffered by the hand of the executioner, except on account of their religion.
 (85) Their serious and sequestered life, averse to the gay luxury of the age, inured them to chastity, temperance, economy, and all the sober and domestic virtues.
 As the greater number were of some trade or profession, it was incumbent on them, by the strictest integrity and the fairest dealing, to remove the suspicions which the profane are too apt to conceive against the appearances of sanctity.
 The contempt of the world exercised them in the habits of humility, meekness, and patience.
 The more they were persecuted, the more closely they adhered to each other.
 Their mutual charity and unsuspecting confidence has been remarked by infidels, and was too often abused by perfidious friends.
 (86) Morality of the fathers It is a very honourable circumstance for the morals of the primitive Christians, that even their faults, or rather errors, were derived from an excess of virtue.
 The bishops and doctors of the church, whose evidence attests, and whose authority might influence, the professions, the principles, and even the practice of their contemporaries, had studied the <WORK_OF_ART>Scriptures</WORK_OF_ART> with less skill than devotion; and they often received in the most literal sense those rigid precepts of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> and the apostles to which the prudence of succeeding commentators has applied a looser and more figurative mode of interpretation.
 Ambitious to exalt the perfection of the <LOC>Gospel</LOC> above the wisdom of philosophy, the zealous fathers have carried the duties of self-mortification, of purity, and of patience, to a height which it is scarcely possible to attain, and much less to preserve, in our present state of weakness and corruption.
 A doctrine so extraordinary and so sublime must inevitably command the veneration of the people; but it was ill calculated to obtain the suffrage of those worldly philosophers who, in the conduct of this transitory life, consult only the feelings of nature and the interest of society.
 (87) Principles of human nature.
 There are <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> very natural propensities which we may distinguish in the most virtuous and liberal dispositions, the love of pleasure and the love of action.
 If the former is refined by art and learning, improved by the charms of social intercourse, and corrected by a just regard to economy, to health, and to reputation, it is productive of the greatest part of the happiness of private life.
 The love of action is a principle of a much stronger and more doubtful nature.
 It often leads to anger, to ambition, and to revenge; but when it is guided by the sense of propriety and benevolence, it becomes the parent of every virtue, and, if those virtues are accompanied with equal abilities, a family, a state, or an empire may be indebted for their safety and prosperity to the undaunted courage of a single man.
 To the love of pleasure we may therefore ascribe most of the agreeable, to the love of action we may attribute most of the useful and respectable, qualifications.
 The character in which both the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> and the other should be united and harmonised would seem to constitute the most perfect idea of human nature.
 The insensible and inactive disposition, which should be supposed alike destitute of both, would be rejected, by the common consent of mankind, as utterly incapable of procuring any happiness to the individual, or any public benefit to the world.
 But it was not in this world that the primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> were desirous of making themselves either agreeable or useful.
 The primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> condemn pleasure and luxury The acquisition of knowledge, the exercise of our reason or fancy, and the cheerful flow of unguarded conversation, may employ the leisure of a liberal mind.
 Such amusements, however, were rejected with abhorrence, or admitted with the utmost caution, by the severity of the fathers, who despised all knowledge that was not useful to salvation, and who considered all levity of discourse as a criminal abuse of the gift of speech.
 In our present state of existence the body is so inseparably connected with the soul, that it seems to be our interest to taste, with innocence and moderation, the enjoyments of which that faithful companion is susceptible.
 Very different was the reasoning of our devout predecessors; vainly aspiring to imitate the perfection of angels, they disdained, or they affected to disdain, every earthly and corporeal delight.
 (88) Some of our senses indeed are necessary for our preservation, others for our subsistence, and others again for our information; and thus far it was impossible to reject the use of them.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> sensation of pleasure was marked as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> moment of their abuse.
 The unfeeling candidate for heaven was instructed, not only to resist the grosser allurements of the taste or smell, but even to shut his ears against the profane harmony of sounds, and to view with indifference the most finished productions of human art.
 Gay apparel, magnificent houses, and elegant furniture were supposed to unite the double guilt of pride and of sensuality: a simple and mortified appearance was more suitable to the <NORP>Christian</NORP> who was certain of his sins and doubtful of his salvation.
 In their censures of luxury the fathers are extremely minute and circumstantial; (89) and among the various articles which excite their pious indignation, we may enumerate false hair, garments of any colour except white, instruments of music, vases of gold or silver, downy pillows (as <PERSON>Jacob</PERSON> reposed his head on a stone), white bread, foreign wines, public salutations, the use of warm baths, and the practice of shaving the beard, which, according to the expression of Tertullian, is a lie against our own faces, and an impious attempt to improve the works of the Creator.
 (90) When <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was introduced among the rich and the polite, the observation of these singular laws was left, as it would be at present, to the few who were ambitious of superior sanctity.
 But it is always easy, as well as agreeable, for the inferior ranks of mankind to claim a merit from the contempt of that pomp and pleasure which fortune has placed beyond their reach.
 The virtue of the primitive Christians, like that of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Romans, was very frequently guarded by poverty and ignorance.
 Their sentiments concerning marriage and chastity.
 The chaste severity of the fathers in whatever related to the commerce of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sexes flowed from the same principle - their abhorrence of every enjoyment which might gratify the sensual and degrade the spiritual nature of man.
 It was their favourite opinion, that if <PERSON>Adam</PERSON> had preserved his obedience to the Creator, he would have lived for ever in a state of virgin purity, and that some harmless mode of vegetation might have peopled paradise with a race of innocent and immortal beings.
 (91) The use of marriage was permitted only to his fallen posterity, as a necessary expedient to continue the human species, and as a restraint, however imperfect, on the natural licentiousness of desire.
 The hesitation of the orthodox casuists on this interesting subject betrays the perplexity of men unwilling to approve an institution which they were compelled to tolerate.
 (92) The enumeration of the very whimsical laws which they most circumstantially imposed on the marriage-bed would force a smile from the young and a blush from the fair.
 It was their unanimous sentiment that a <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> marriage was adequate to all the purposes of nature and of society.
 The sensual connection was refined into a resemblance of the mystic union of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> with his church, and was pronounced to be indissoluble either by divorce or by death.
 The practice of <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> nuptials was branded with the name of a legal adultery; and the persons who were guilty of so scandalous an offence against <NORP>Christian</NORP> purity were soon excluded from the honours, and even from the arms, of the church.
 (93) Since desire was imputed as a crime, and marriage was tolerated as a defect, it was consistent with the same principles to consider a state of celibacy as the nearest approach to the Divine perfection.
 It was with the utmost difficulty that ancient <GPE>Rome</GPE> could support the institution of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> vestals ; (94) but the primitive church was filled with a great number of persons of either sex who had devoted themselves to the profession of perpetual chastity.
 (95) A few of these, among whom we may reckon the learned Origen, judged it the most prudent to disarm the tempter.
 (96) Some were insensible and some were invincible against the assaults of the flesh.
 Disdaining an ignominious flight, the virgins of the warm climate of <LOC>Africa</LOC> encountered the enemy in the closest engagement they permitted priests and deacons to share their bed and gloried amidst the flames in their unsullied purity.
 But insulted <PERSON>Nature</PERSON> sometimes vindicated her rights, and this new species of martyrdom served only to introduce a new scandal into the church.
 (97) Among the <NORP>Christian</NORP> ascetics, however (a name which they soon acquired from their painful exercise), many, as they were less presumptuous, were probably more successful.
 The loss of sensual pleasure was supplied and compensated by spiritual pride.
 Even the multitude of <NORP>Pagans</NORP> were inclined to estimate the merit of the sacrifice by its apparent difficulty; and it was in the praise of these chaste spouses of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> that the fathers have poured forth the troubled stream of their eloquence.
 (98) Such are the early traces of monastic principles and institutions, which, in a subsequent age, have counterbalanced all the temporal advantages of Christianity.
 (99) Their aversion to the business of war and government The <NORP>Christians</NORP> were not less adverse to the business than to the pleasures of this world.
 The defence of our persons and property they knew not how to reconcile with the patient doctrine which enjoined an unlimited forgiveness of past injuries, and commanded them to invite the repetition of fresh insults.
 Their simplicity was offended by the use of oaths, by the pomp of magistracy, and by the active contention of public life; nor could their humane ignorance be convinced that it was lawful on any occasion to shed the blood of our fellow-creatures, either by the sword of justice or by that of war, even though their criminal or hostile attempts should threaten the peace and safety of the whole community.
 (100) It was acknowledged that, under a less perfect law, the powers of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> constitution had been exercised, with the approbation of Heaven, by inspired prophets and by anointed kings.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> felt and confessed that such institutions might be necessary for the present system of the world, and they cheerfully submitted to the authority of their <NORP>Pagan</NORP> governors.
 But while they inculcated the maxims of passive obedience, they refused to take any active part in the civil administration or the military defence of the empire.
 Some indulgence might perhaps be allowed to those persons who, before their conversion, were already engaged in such violent and sanguinary occupations; (101) but it was impossible that the Christians, without renouncing a more sacred duty, could assume the character of soldiers, of magistrates, or of princes.
 (102) This indolent, or even criminal disregard to the public welfare, exposed them to the contempt and reproaches of the Pagans, who very frequently asked, what must be the fate of the empire, attacked on every side by the barbarians, if all mankind should adopt the pusillanimous sentiments of the new sect? (103) To this insulting question the <NORP>Christian</NORP> apologists returned obscure and ambiguous answers, as they were unwilling to reveal the secret cause of their security; the expectation that, before the conversion of mankind was accomplished, war, government, the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, and the world itself, would be no more.
 It may be observed that, in this instance likewise, the situation of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Christians</NORP> coincided very happily with their religious scruples, and that their aversion to an active life contributed rather to excuse them from the service than to exclude them from the honours of the state and army.
 V.
 THE FIFTH CAUSE The <NORP>Christians</NORP> active in the government of the church But the human character, however it may be exalted or depressed by a temporary enthusiasm, will return by degrees to its proper and natural level, and will resume those passions that seem the most adapted to its present condition.
 The primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> were dead to the business and pleasures of the world; but their love of action, which could never be entirely extinguished, soon revived, and found a new occupation in the government of the church.
 A separate society, which attacked the established religion of the empire, was obliged to adopt some form of internal policy, and to appoint a sufficient number of ministers, intrusted not only with the spiritual functions, but even with the temporal direction of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> commonwealth.
 The safety of the society, its honour, its aggrandisement, were productive, even in the most pious minds, of a spirit of patriotism, such as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had felt for the republic, and sometimes of a similar indifference in the use of whatever means might probably conduce to so desirable an end.
 The ambition of raising themselves or their friends to the honours and offices of the church was disguised by the laudable intention of devoting to the public benefit the power and consideration which, for that purpose only, it became their duty to solicit.
 In the exercise of their functions they were frequently called upon to detect the errors of heresy or the arts of faction, to oppose the designs of perfidious brethren, to stigmatise their characters with deserved infamy, and to expel them from the bosom of a society whose peace and happiness they had attempted to disturb.
 The ecclesiastical governors of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> were taught to unite the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove; but as the former was refined, so the latter was insensibly corrupted, by the habits of government.
 In the church as well as in the world, the persons who were placed in any public station rendered themselves considerable by their eloquence and firmness, by their knowledge of mankind, and by their dexterity in business; and while they concealed from others, and perhaps from themselves, the secret motives of their conduct, they too frequently relapsed into all the turbulent passions of active life, which were tinctured with an additional degree of bitterness and obstinacy from the infusion of spiritual zeal.
 Its primitive freedom and equality.
 The government of the church has often been the subject, as well as the prize, of religious contention.
 The hostile disputants of Rome, of Paris, of Oxford, and of Geneva, have alike struggled to reduce the primitive and apostolic model (104) to the respective standards of their own policy.
 The few who have pursued this inquiry with more candour and impartiality are of opinion (105) that the apostles declined the office of legislation, and rather chose to endure some partial scandals and divisions, than to exclude the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of a future age from the liberty of varying their forms of ecclesiastical government according to the changes of times and circumstances.
 The scheme of policy which, under their approbation, was adopted for the use of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> century, may be discovered from the practice of Jerusalem, of Ephesus, or of Corinth.
 The societies which were instituted in the cities of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire were united only by the ties of faith and charity.
 Independence and equality formed the basis of their internal constitution.
 The want of discipline and human learning was supplied by the occasional assistance of the prophets, (106)who were called to that function without distinction of age, of sex, or of natural abilities, and who, as often as they felt the divine impulse, poured forth the effusions of the Spirit in the assembly of the faithful.
 But these extraordinary gifts were frequently abused or misapplied by the prophetic teachers.
 They displayed them at an improper season, presumptuously disturbed the service of the assembly, and by their pride or mistaken zeal they introduced, particularly into the apostolic church of Corinth, a long and melancholy train of disorders.
 (107) As the institution of prophets became useless, and even pernicious, their powers were withdrawn, and their office abolished.
 The public functions of religion were solely intrusted to the established ministers of the church, the bishops and the presbyters; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> appellations which, in their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> origin, appear to have distinguished the same office and the same order of persons.
 The name of <PERSON>Presbyter</PERSON> was expressive of their age, or rather of their gravity and wisdom.
 The title of <PERSON>Bishop</PERSON> denoted their inspection over the faith and manners of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> who were committed to their pastoral care.
 In proportion to the respective numbers of the faithful, a larger or smaller number of these episcopal presbyters guided each infant congregation with equal authority and with united counsel.
 (108) Institutions of bishops as presidents of the college of presbyters But the most perfect equality of freedom requires the directing hand of a superior magistrate: and the order of public deliberations soon introduces the office of a president, invested at least with the authority of collecting the sentiments, and of executing the resolutions, of the assembly.
 A regard for the public tranquillity, which would so frequently have been interrupted by <DATE>annual</DATE> or by occasional elections, induced the primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> to constitute an honourable and perpetual magistracy, and to choose <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the wisest and most holy among their presbyters to execute, during his life, the duties of their ecclesiastical governor.
 It was under these circumstances that the lofty title of <PERSON>Bishop</PERSON> began to raise itself above the humble appellation of Presbyter; and while the latter remained the most natural distinction for the members of every <NORP>Christian</NORP> senate, the former was appropriated to the dignity of its new president.
 (109) The advantages of this espiscopal form of government, which appears to have been introduced before the end of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> century, (110) were so obvious, and so important for the future greatness, as well as the present peace, of Christianity, that it was adopted without delay by all the societies which were already scattered over the empire, had acquired in a very early period the sanction of antiquity, (111) and is still revered by the most powerful churches, both of the <LOC>East</LOC> and of the West, as a primitive and even as a divine establishment.
 (112) It is needless to observe that the pious and humble presbyters who were <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> dignified with the episcopal title could not possess and would probably have rejected, the power and pomp which now encircles the tiara of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, or the mitre of a <NORP>German</NORP> prelate.
 But we may define in a few words the narrow limits of their original jurisdiction, which was chiefly of a spiritual, though in some instances of a temporal nature.
 (113) It consisted in the administration of the sacraments and discipline of the church, the superintendency of religious ceremonies, which imperceptibly increased in number and variety, the consecration of ecclesiastical ministers, to whom the bishop assigned their respective functions, the management of the public fund, and the determination of all such differences as the faithful were unwilling to expose before the tribunal of an idolatrous judge.
 These powers, during a short period, were exercised according to the advice of the presbyteral college, and with the consent and approbation of the assembly of Christians.
 The primitive bishops were considered only as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of their equals, and the honourable servants of a free people.
 Whenever the episcopal chair became vacant by death, a new president was chosen among the presbyters by the suffrage of the whole congregation, every member of which supposed himself invested with a sacred and sacerdotal character.
 (114) Provincial councils Such was the mild and equal constitution by which the <NORP>Christians</NORP> were governed more than an hundred years after the death of the apostles.
 Every society formed within itself a separate and independent republic; and although the most distant of these little states maintained a mutual as well as friendly intercourse of letters and deputations, the <NORP>Christian</NORP> world was not yet connected by any supreme authority or legislative assembly.
 As the numbers of the faithful were gradually multiplied, they discovered the advantages that might result from a closer union of their interest and designs.
 Towards the end of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> century, the churches of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and <LOC>Asia</LOC> adopted the useful institutions of provincial synods, and they may justly be supposed to have borrowed the model of a representative council from the celebrated examples of their own country, the Amphictyons, the <NORP>Achaean</NORP> league, or the assemblies of the <NORP>Ionian</NORP> cities.
 It was soon established as a custom and as a law, that the bishops of the independent churches should meet in the capital of the province at the stated periods of <DATE>spring</DATE> and autumn.
 Their deliberations were assisted by the advice of a few distinguished presbyters, and moderated by the presence of a listening multitude.
 (115) Their decrees, which were styled Canons, regulated every important controversy of faith and discipline; and it was natural to believe that a liberal effusion of the Holy Spirit would be poured on the united assembly of the delegates of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> people.
 Union of the church The institution of synods was so well suited to private ambition and to public interest, that in the space of a few years it was received throughout the whole empire.
 A regular correspondence was established between the provincial councils, which mutually communicated and approved their respective proceedings; and the catholic church soon assumed the form, and acquired the strength, of a great foederative republic.
 (116) Progress of episcopal authority.
 As the legislative authority of the particular churches was insensibly superseded by the use of councils, the bishops obtained by their alliance a much larger share of executive and arbitrary power; and as soon as they were connected by a sense of their common interest, they were enabled to attack, with united vigour, the original rights of their clergy and people.
 The prelates of the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> century imperceptibly changed the language of exhortation into that of command, scattered the seeds of future usurpations, and supplied, by scripture allegories and declamatory rhetoric, their deficiency of force and of reason.
 They exalted the unity and power of the church, as it was represented in the EPISCOPAL OFFICE, of which every bishop enjoyed an equal and undivided portion.
 (117) Princes and magistrates, it was often repeated, might boast an earthly claim to a transitory dominion: it was the episcopal authority alone which was derived from the Deity, and extended itself over this and over another world.
 The bishops were the vicegerents of Christ, the successors of the apostles, and the mystic substitutes of the high priest of the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> law.
 Their exclusive privilege of conferring the sacerdotal character invaded the freedom both of clerical and of popular elections: and if, in the administration of the church, they still consulted the judgment of the presbyters or the inclination of the people, they most carefully inculcated the merit of such a voluntary condescension.
 The bishops acknowledged the supreme authority which resided in the assembly of their brethren; but in the government of his peculiar diocese each of them exacted from his flock the same implicit obedience as if that favourite metaphor had been literally just, and as if the shepherd had been of a more exalted nature than that of his sheep.
 (118) This obedience, however, was not imposed without some efforts on the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> side, and some resistance on the other.
 The democratical part of the constitution was, in many places, very warmly supported by the zealous or interested opposition of the inferior clergy.
 But their patriotism received the ignominious epithets of faction and schism, and the episcopal cause was indebted for its rapid progress to the labours of many active prelates, who like <PERSON>Cyprian</PERSON> of Carthage, could reconcile the arts of the most ambitious statesman with the <NORP>Christian</NORP> virtues which seem adapted to the character of a saint and martyr.
 (119) Pre-eminence of the metropolitan churches.
 The same causes which at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> had destroyed the equality of the presbyters introduced among the bishops a pre-eminence of rank, and from thence a superiority of jurisdiction.
 As often as in the <DATE>spring</DATE> and autumn they met in provincial synod, the difference of personal merit and reputation was very sensibly felt among the members of the assembly, and the multitude was governed by the wisdom and eloquence of the few.
 But the order of public proceedings required a more regular and less invidious distinction; the office of perpetual presidents in the councils of each province was conferred on the bishops of the principal city; and these aspiring prelates, who soon acquired the lofty titles of <NORP>Metropolitans</NORP> and Primates, secretly prepared themselves to usurp over their episcopal brethren the same authority which the bishops had so lately assumed above the college of presbyters.
 (120) Nor was it long before an emulation of pre-eminence and power prevailed among the <NORP>Metropolitans</NORP> themselves, each of them affecting to display, in the most pompous terms, the temporal honours and advantages of the city over which he presided; the numbers and opulence of the <NORP>Christians</NORP> who were subject to their pastoral care; the saints and martyrs who had arisen among them; and the purity with which they preserved the tradition of the faith as it had been transmitted through a series of orthodox bishops from the apostle or the apostolic disciple to whom the foundation of their church was ascribed.
 (121) From every cause, either of a civil or of an ecclesiastical nature, it was easy to foresee that <GPE>Rome</GPE> must enjoy the respect, and would soon claim the obedience, of the provinces.
 Ambition of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff The society of the faithful bore a just proportion to the capital of the empire; and the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church was the greatest, the most numerous, and, in regard to the West, the most ancient of all the <NORP>Christian</NORP> establishments, many of which had received their religion from the pious labours of her missionaries.
 Instead of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> apostolic founder, the utmost boast of Antioch, of Ephesus, or of Corinth, the banks of the <LOC>Tiber</LOC> were supposed to have been honoured with the preaching and martyrdom of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most eminent among the apostles; (122) and the bishop of <GPE>Rome</GPE> very prudently claimed the inheritance of whatsoever prerogatives were attributed either to the person or to the office of St.
 Peter.
 (123) The bishops of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and of the provinces were disposed to allow them a primacy of order and association (such was their very accurate expression) in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> aristocracy.
 (124) But the power of a monarch was rejected with abhorrence, and the aspiring genius of <GPE>Rome</GPE> experienced from the nations of <LOC>Asia</LOC> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> a more vigorous resistance to her spiritual than she had formerly done to her temporal dominions.
 The patriotic Cyprian, who ruled with the most absolute sway the church of <GPE>Carthage</GPE> and the provincial synods, opposed with resolution and success the ambition of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> pontiff, artfully connected his own cause with that of the eastern bishops, and, like Hannibal, sought out new allies in the heart of Asia.
 (125) If this Punic war was carried on without any effusion of blood, it was owing much less to the moderation than to the weakness of the contending prelates.
 Invectives and excommunications were their only weapons; and these, during the progress of the whole controversy, they hurled against each other with equal fury and devotion.
 The hard necessity of censuring either a pope or a saint and martyr distresses the modern <NORP>Catholics</NORP> whenever they are obliged to relate the particulars of a dispute in which the champions of religion indulged such passions as seem much more adapted to the senate or to the camp.
 (126) Laity and clergy The progress of the ecclesiastical authority gave birth to the memorable distinction of the laity and of the clergy, which had been unknown to the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Romans.
 (127) The former of these appellations comprehended the body of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> people; the latter, according to the signification of the word, was appropriated to the chosen portion that had been set apart for the service of religion; a celebrated order of men which has furnished the most important, though not always the most edifying, subjects for modern history.
 Their mutual hostilities sometimes disturbed the peace of the infant church, but their zeal and activity were united in the common cause, and the love of power, which (under the most artful disguises) would insinuate itself into the breasts of bishops and martyrs, animated them to increase the number of their subjects, and to enlarge the limits of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> empire.
 They were destitute of any temporal force, and they were for a long time discouraged and oppressed, rather than assisted, by the civil magistrate; but they had acquired, and they employed within their own society, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> most efficacious instruments of government, rewards and punishments; the former derived from the pious liberality, the latter from the devout apprehensions of the faithful.
 Oblations and revenue of the church.
 I.
 The community of goods, which had so agreeably amused the imagination of Plato, (128) and which subsisted in some degree among the austere sect of the Essenians, (129) was adopted for short time in the primitive church.
 The fervour of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> proselytes prompted them to sell those worldly possessions which they despised, to lay the price of them at the feet of the apostles, and to content themselves with receiving an equal share out of the general distribution.
 (130) The progress of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion relaxed, and gradually abolished, this generous institution, which, in hands less pure than those of the apostles, would too soon have been corrupted and abused by the returning selfishness of human nature; and the converts who embraced the new religion were permitted to retain the possession of their patrimony, to receive legacies and inheritances, and to increase their separate property by all the lawful means of trade and industry.
 Instead of an absolute sacrifice, a moderate proportion was accepted by the ministers of the Gospel; and in their <DATE>weekly</DATE> or <DATE>monthly</DATE> assemblies every believer, according to the exigency of the occasion, and the measure of his wealth and piety, presented his voluntary offering for the use of the common fund.
 (131) Nothing, however inconsiderable, was refused but it was diligently inculcated that, in the article of tithes, the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> law was still of divine obligation; and that, since the Jews, under a less perfect discipline, had been commanded to pay a <ORDINAL>tenth</ORDINAL> part of all that they possessed, it would become the disciples of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> to distinguish themselves by a superior degree of liberality, (132) and to acquire some merit by resigning a superfluous treasure, which must so soon be annihilated with the world itself.
 (133) It is almost unnecessary to observe that the revenue of each particular church, which was of so uncertain and fluctuating a nature, must have varied with the poverty or the opulence of the faithful, as they were dispersed in obscure villages, or collected in the great cities of the empire.
 In the time of the emperor <GPE>Decius</GPE> it was the opinion of the magistrates that the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of <GPE>Rome</GPE> were possessed of very considerable wealth, that vessels of gold and silver were used in their religious worship and that many among their proselytes had sold their lands and houses to increase the public riches of the sect, at the expense, indeed, of their unfortunate children, who found themselves beggars because their parents had been saints.
 (134) We should listen with distrust to the suspicions of strangers and enemies; on this occasion, however, they receive a very specious and probable colour from the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> following circumstances, the only ones that have reached our knowledge which define any precise sums or convey any distinct idea.
 Almost at the same period the bishop of Carthage, from a society less opulent than that of Rome, collected an hundred thousand sesterces (above eight hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> pounds sterling), on a sudden call of charity to redeem the brethren of Numidia, who had been carried away captives by the barbarians of the desert.
 (135) About an hundred years before the reign of <GPE>Decius</GPE> the <NORP>Roman</NORP> church had received, in a single donation, the sum of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand sesterces from a stranger of Pontus, who proposed to fix his residence in the capital.
 (136) These oblations, for the most part, were made in money; nor was the society of <NORP>Christians</NORP> either desirous or capable of acquiring, to any considerable degree, the incumbrance of landed property.
 It had been provided by several laws, which were enacted with the same design as our statutes of mortmain, that no real estates should be given or bequeathed to any corporate body without either a special privilege or a particular dispensation from the emperor or from the senate; (137) who were seldom disposed to grant them in favour of a sect, at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> the object of their contempt, and at last of their fears and jealousy.
 A transaction, however, is related under the reign of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> Severus, which discovers that the restraint was sometimes eluded or suspended, and that the <NORP>Christians</NORP> were permitted to claim and to possess lands within the limits of <GPE>Rome</GPE> itself.
 (138) The progress of Christianity, and the civil confusion of the empire, contributed to relax the severity of the laws; and, before the close of the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> century, many considerable estates were bestowed on the opulent churches of Rome, Milan, Carthage, Antioch, Alexandria, and the other great cities of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the provinces.
 Distribution of the revenue.
 The bishop was the natural steward of the church; the public stock was intrusted to his care without account or control; the presbyters were confined to their spiritual functions, and the more dependent order of deacons was solely employed in the management and distribution of the ecclesiastical revenue.
 (139) If we may give credit to the vehement declamations of Cyprian, there were too many among his <NORP>African</NORP> brethren who, in the execution of their charge, violated every precept, not only of evangelic perfection, but even of moral virtue.
 By some of these unfaithful stewards the riches of the church were lavished in sensual pleasures; by others they were perverted to the purposes of private gain, of fraudulent purchases, and of rapacious usury.
 (140) But as long as the contributions of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> people were free and unconstrained, the abuse of their confidence could not be very frequent, and the general uses to which their liberality was applied reflected honour on the religious society.
 A decent portion was reserved for the maintenance of the bishop and his clergy; a sufficient sum was allotted for the expenses of the public worship, of which the feasts of love, the agapae, as they were called, constituted a very pleasing part.
 The whole remainder was the sacred patrimony of the poor, According to the discretion of the bishop, it was distributed to support widows and orphans, the lame, the sick, and the aged of the community; to comfort strangers and pilgrims, and to alleviate the misfortunes of prisoners and captives, more especially when their sufferings had been occasioned by their firm attachment to the cause of religion.
 (141) A generous intercourse of charity united the most distant provinces, and the smaller congregations were cheerfully assisted by the alms of their more opulent brethren.
 (142) Such an institution, which paid less regard to the merit than to the distress of the object, very materially conduced to the progress of Christianity.
 The pagans, who were actuated by sense of humanity, while they derided the doctrines, acknowledged the benevolence, of the new sect.
 (143) The prospect of immediate relief and of future protection allured into its hospitable bosom many of those unhappy persons whom the neglect of the world would have abandoned to the miseries of want, of sickness, and of old age.
 There is some reason likewise to believe that great numbers of infants who, according to the inhuman practice of the times, had been exposed by their parents, were frequently rescued from death, baptised, educated, and maintained by the piety of the Christians, and at the expense of the public treasure.
 (144) Excommunication II.
 It is the undoubted right of every society to exclude from its communion and benefits such among its members as reject or violate those regulations which have been established by general consent.
 In the exercise of this power the censures of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> church were chiefly directed against scandalous sinners, and particularly those who were guilty of murder, of fraud, or of incontinence; against the authors or the followers, of any heretical opinions which had been condemned by the judgment of the episcopal order; and against those unhappy persons who, whether from choice or from compulsion, had polluted themselves after their baptism by any act of idolatrous worship.
 The consequences of ex-communication were of temporal as well as a spiritual nature.
 The <NORP>Christian</NORP> against whom it was pronounced was deprived of any part in the oblations of the faithful.
 The ties both of religious and of private friendship were dissolved: he found himself a profane object of abhorrence to the persons whom he the most esteemed, or by whom he had been the most tenderly beloved; and as far as an expulsion from a respectable society could imprint on his character a mark of disgrace, he was shunned or suspected by the generality of mankind.
 The situation of these unfortunate exiles was in itself very painful and melancholy; but, as it usually happens, their apprehensions far exceeded their sufferings.
 The benefits of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> communion were those of eternal life; nor could they erase from their minds the awful opinion that to those ecclesiastical governors by whom they were condemned the <PERSON>Deity</PERSON> had committed the keys of Hell and of Paradise.
 The heretics, indeed, who might be supported by the consciousness of their intentions, and by the flattering hope that they alone had discovered the true path of salvation, endeavoured to regain in their separate assemblies those comforts, temporal as well as spiritual, which they no longer derived from the great society of Christians.
 But almost all those who had reluctantly yielded to the power of vice or idolatry were sensible of their fallen condition, and anxiously desirous of being restored to the benefits of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> communion.
 With regard to the treatment of these penitents, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> opposite opinions, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of justice, the other of mercy, divided the primitive church.
 The more rigid and inflexible casuists refused them for ever, and without exception, the meanest place in the holy community which they had disgraced or deserted; and leaving them to the remorse of a guilty conscience, indulged them only with a faint ray of hope that the contrition of their life and death might possibly be accepted by the Supreme Being.
 (145) A milder sentiment was embraced, in practice as well as in theory, by the purest and most respectable of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> churches.
 (146) The gates of reconciliation and of heaven were seldom shut against the returning penitent; but a severe and solemn form of discipline was instituted, which, while it served to expiate his crime, might powerfully deter the spectators from the imitation of his example.
Public pennance Humbled by a public confession, emaciated by fasting, and clothed in sackcloth, the penitent lay prostrate at the door of the assembly, imploring with tears the pardon of his offences, and soliciting the prayers of the faithful.
 (147) If the fault was of a very heinous nature, whole years of penance were esteemed an inadequate satisfaction to the Divine justice; and it was always by slow and painful gradations that the sinner, the heretic, or the apostate was readmitted into the bosom of the church.
 A sentence of perpetual ex-communication was, however, reserved for some crimes of an extraordinary magnitude, and particularly for the inexcusable relapses of those penitents who had already experienced and abused the clemency of their ecclesiastical superiors.
 According to the circumstances or the number of the guilty, the exercise of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> discipline was varied by the discretion of the bishops.
 The councils of <FAC>Ancyra</FAC> and <ORG>Illiberis</ORG> were held about the same time, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> in Galatia, the other in Spain; but their respective canons, which are still extant, seem to breathe a very different spirit.
 The Galatian, who after his baptism had repeatedly sacrificed to idols, might obtain his pardon by a penance of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years; and if he had seduced others to imitate his example, only <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years more were added to the term of his exile.
 But the unhappy <NORP>Spaniard</NORP> who had committed the same offence was deprived of the hope of reconciliation even in the article of death; and his idolatry was placed at the head of a list of <CARDINAL>seventeen</CARDINAL> other crimes, against which a sentence no less terrible was pronounced.
 Among these we may distinguish the inexpiable guilt of calumniating a bishop, a presbyter, or even a deacon.
 (148) The dignity of episcopal government.
 The well-tempered mixture of liberality and rigour, the judicious dispensation of rewards and punishments, according to the maxims of policy as well as justice, constituted the human strength of the church.
 The bishops, whose paternal care extended itself to the government of both worlds, were sensible of the importance of these prerogatives; and, covering their ambition with the fair pretence of the love of order, they were jealous of any rival in the exercise of a discipline so necessary to prevent the desertion of those troops which had enlisted themselves under the banner of the Cross, and whose numbers every day became more considerable.
 From the imperious declamations of <PERSON>Cyprian</PERSON> we should naturally conclude that the doctrines of ex-communication and penance formed the most essential part of religion; and that it was much less dangerous for the disciples of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> to neglect the observance of the moral duties than to despise the censures and authority of their bishops.
 Sometimes we might imagine that we were listening to the voice of Moses, when he commanded the earth to open, and to swallow up, in consuming flames, the rebellious race which refused obedience to the priesthood of Aaron; and we should sometimes suppose that we heard a <NORP>Roman</NORP> consul asserting the majesty of the republic, and declaring his inflexible resolution to enforce the rigour of the laws.
 <PERSON>Cyprian</PERSON> had renounced those temporal honours which it is probable he would never have obtained; but the acquisition of such absolute command over the consciences and understanding of a congregation, however obscure or despised by the world, is more truly grateful to the pride of the human heart than the possession of the most despotic power imposed by arms and conquest on a reluctant people.
 Recapitulation of the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> causes.
 In the course of this important, though perhaps tedious, inquiry, I have attempted to display the <ORDINAL>secondary</ORDINAL> causes which so efficaciously assisted the truth of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion.
 If among these causes we have discovered any artificial ornaments, any accidental circumstances, or any mixture of error and passion, it cannot appear surprising that mankind should be the most sensibly affected by such motives as were suited to their imperfect nature.
 It was by the aid of these causes - exclusive zeal, the immediate expectation of another world, the claim of miracles, the practice of rigid virtue, and the constitution of the primitive church - that <NORP>Christianity</NORP> spread itself with so much success in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 To the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these the <NORP>Christians</NORP> were indebted for their invincible valour, which disdained to capitulate with the enemy whom they were resolved to vanquish.
 The <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> succeeding causes supplied their valour with the most formidable arms.
 The last of these causes united their courage, directed their arms, and gave their efforts that irresistible weight which even a small band of well-trained and intrepid volunteers has so often possessed over an undisciplined multitude, ignorant of the subject and careless of the event of the war.
 Weakness of Polytheism.
 In the various religions of <ORG>Polytheism</ORG> some wandering fanatics of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> and Syria, who addressed themselves to the credulous superstition of the populace, were perhaps the only order of priests (150) that derived their whole support and credit from their sacerdotal profession, and were very deeply affected by a personal concern for the safety or prosperity of their tutelar deities.
 The ministers of Polytheism, both in <GPE>Rome</GPE> and in the provinces, were, for the most part, men of a noble birth and of an affluent fortune, who received, as an honourable distinction, the care of a celebrated temple or of a public sacrifice, exhibited, very frequently at their own expense, the sacred games, (151) and with cold indifference performed the ancient rites, according to the laws and fashion of their country.
 As they were engaged in the ordinary occupations of life, their zeal and devotion were seldom animated by a sense of interest, or by the habits of an ecclesiastical character.
 Confined to their respective temples and cities, they remained without any connection of discipline or government; and whilst they acknowledged the supreme jurisdiction of the senate, of the college of pontiffs, and of the emperor, those civil magistrates contented themselves with the easy task of maintaining in peace and dignity the general worship of mankind.
 We have already seen how various, how loose, and how uncertain were the religious sentiments of Polytheists.
 They were abandoned, almost without control, to the natural workings of a superstitious fancy.
 The accidental circumstances of their life and situation determined the object as well as the degree of their devotion; and as long as their adoration was successively prostituted to a thousand deities, it was scarcely possible that their hearts could be susceptible of a very sincere or lively passion for any of them.
 Scepticism of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> world proved favourable to the new religion.
 When <NORP>Christianity</NORP> appeared in the world, even these faint and imperfect impressions had lost much of their original power.
 Human reason, which by its unassisted strength is incapable of perceiving the mysteries of faith, had already obtained an easy triumph over the folly of Paganism; and when <PERSON>Tertullian</PERSON> or <PERSON>Lactantius</PERSON> employ their labours in exposing its falsehood and extravagance, they are obliged to transcribe the eloquence of <PERSON>Cicero</PERSON> or the wit of Lucian.
 The contagion of these sceptical writings had been diffused far beyond the number of their readers.
 The fashion of incredulity was communicated from the philosopher to the man of pleasure or business, from the noble to the plebeian, and from the master to the menial slave who waited at his table, and who eagerly listened to the freedom of his conversation.
 On public occasions the philosophic part of mankind affected to treat with respect and decency the religious institutions of their country, but their secret contempt penetrated through the thin and awkward disguise; and even the people, when they discovered that their deities were rejected and derided by those whose rank or understanding they were accustomed to reverence, were filled with doubts and apprehensions concerning the truth of those doctrines to which they had yielded the most implicit belief.
 The decline of ancient prejudice exposed a very numerous portion of human kind to the danger of a painful and comfortless situation.
 A state of scepticism and suspense may amuse a few inquisitive minds.
 But the practice of superstition is so congenial to the multitude that, if they are forcibly awakened, they still regret the loss of their pleasing vision.
 Their love of the marvellous and supernatural, their curiosity with regard to future events, and their strong propensity to extend their hopes and fears beyond the limits of the visible world, were the principal causes which favoured the establishment of Polytheism.
 So urgent on the vulgar is the necessity of believing, that the fall of any system of mythology will most probably be succeeded by the introduction of some other mode of superstition.
 Some deities of a more recent and fashionable cast might soon have occupied the deserted temples of <LOC>Jupiter</LOC> and Apollo, if, in the decisive moment, the wisdom of <GPE>Providence</GPE> had not interposed a genuine revelation fitted to inspire the most rational esteem and conviction, whilst, at the same time, it was adorned with all that could attract the curiosity, the wonder, and the veneration of the people.
 In their actual disposition, as many were almost disengaged from their artificial prejudices, but equally susceptible and desirous of a devout attachment, an object much less deserving would have been sufficient to fill the vacant place in their hearts, and to gratify the uncertain eagerness of their passions.
 Those who are inclined to pursue this reflection, instead of viewing with astonishment the rapid progress of Christianity, will perhaps be surprised that its success was not still more rapid and still more universal.
 As well as the peace and union of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 It has been observed, with truth as well as propriety, that the conquests of <GPE>Rome</GPE> prepared and facilitated those of Christianity.
 In the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> chapter of this work we have attempted to explain in what manner the most civilised provinces of Europe, Asia, and <LOC>Africa</LOC> were united under the dominion of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> sovereign, and gradually connected by the most intimate ties of laws, of manners, and of language.
 The <NORP>Jews</NORP> of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> who had fondly expected a temporal deliverer, gave so cold a reception to the miracles of the divine prophet, that it was found unnecessary to publish, or at least to preserve, any <LANGUAGE>Hebrew</LANGUAGE> gospel.
 (152) The authentic histories of the actions of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> were composed in the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> languages at a considerable distance from <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> and after the <NORP>Gentile</NORP> converts were grown extremely numerous.
 (153) As soon as those histories were translated into the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> tongue they were perfectly intelligible to all the subjects of Rome, excepting only to the peasants of <GPE>Syria</GPE> and Egypt, for whose benefit particular versions were afterwards made.
 The public highways, which had been constructed for the use of the legions, opened an easy passage for the <NORP>Christian</NORP> missionaries from <GPE>Damascus</GPE> to Corinth, and from <GPE>Italy</GPE> to the extremity of <GPE>Spain</GPE> or Britain; nor did those spiritual conquerors encounter any of the obstacles which usually retard or prevent the introduction of a foreign religion into a distant country.
 Historical views of the progress of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> There is the strongest reason to believe that before the reigns of <PERSON>Diocletian</PERSON> and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the faith of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> had been preached in every province, and in all the great cities of the empire; but the foundation of the several congregations, the numbers of the faithful who composed them, and their proportion to the unbelieving multitude, are now buried in obscurity or disguised by fiction and declamation.
 Such imperfect circumstances, however, as have reached our knowledge concerning the increase of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> name in <LOC>Asia</LOC> and Greece, in Egypt, in Italy, and in the West, we shall now proceed to relate, without neglecting the real or imaginary acquisitions which lay beyond the frontiers of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 In the East.
 The rich provinces that extend from the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> to the <NORP>Ionian</NORP> sea were the principal theatre on which the apostle of the <NORP>Gentiles</NORP> displayed his zeal and piety.
 The seeds of the Gospel, which he had scattered in a fertile soil, were diligently cultivated by his disciples; and it should seem that, during the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> centuries, the most considerable body of <NORP>Christians</NORP> was contained within those limits.
 Among the societies which were instituted in Syria, none were more ancient or more illustrious than those of Damascus, of <GPE>Beroea</GPE> or Aleppo, and of Antioch.
 The prophetic introduction of the <WORK_OF_ART>Apocalypse</WORK_OF_ART> had described and immortalised the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> churches of <LOC>Asia</LOC> - Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, (154) Sardes, Laodicea, and Philadelphia; and their colonies were soon diffused over that populous country.
 In a very early period, the islands of <GPE>Cyprus</GPE> and Crete, the provinces of <GPE>Thrace</GPE> and Macedonia, gave a favourable reception to the new religion; and <NORP>Christian</NORP> republics were soon founded in the cities of Corinth, of Sparta, and of Athens.
 (155) The antiquity of the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> and <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> churches allowed a sufficient space of time for their increase and multiplication; and even the swarms of <NORP>Gnostics</NORP> and other heretics serve to display the flourishing condition of the orthodox church, since the appellation of heretics has always been applied to the less numerous party.
 To these domestic testimonies we may add the confession, the complaints, and the apprehensions of the <NORP>Gentiles</NORP> themselves.
 From the writings of Lucian, a philosopher who had studied mankind, and who describes their manners in the most lively colours, we may learn that, under the reign of Commodus, his native country of <LOC>Pontus</LOC> was filled with <NORP>Epicureans</NORP> and Christians.
 (156) Within four-score years after the death of Christ, (157) the humane <PERSON>Pliny</PERSON> laments the magnitude of the evil which he vainly attempted to eradicate.
 In his very curious epistle to the emperor <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> he affirms that the temples were almost deserted, that the sacred victims scarcely found any purchasers, and that the superstition had not only infected the cities, but had even spread itself into the villages and the open country of <LOC>Pontus</LOC> and Bithynia.
 (158) The church of Antioch.
 Without descending into a minute scrutiny of the expressions or of the motives of those writers who either celebrate or lament the progress of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> in the East, it may in general be observed that none of them have left us any grounds from whence a just estimate might be formed of the real numbers of the faithful in those provinces.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> circumstance, however, has been fortunately preserved, which seems to cast a more distinct light on this obscure but interesting subject.
 Under the reign of Theodosius, after <NORP>Christianity</NORP> had enjoyed, during more than sixty years, the sunshine of <NORP>Imperial</NORP> favour, the ancient and illustrious church of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> consisted of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred thousand persons, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand of whom were supported out of the public oblations.
 (159) The splendour and dignity of the queen of the East, the acknowledged populousness of Caesarea, Seleucia, and Alexandria, and the destruction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand souls in the earthquake which afflicted <GPE>Antioch</GPE> under the elder Justin, (160) are so many convincing proofs that the whole number of its inhabitants was not less than half a million, and that the Christians, however multiplied by zeal and power, did not exceed a <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> part of that great city.
 How different a proportion must we adopt when we compare the persecuted with the triumphant church, the <LOC>West</LOC> with the East, remote villages with populous towns, and countries recently converted to the faith with the place where the believers <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> received the appellation of Christians! It must not, however, be dissembled that, in another passage, Chrysostom, to whom we are indebted for this useful information, computes the multitude of the faithful as even superior to that of the <NORP>Jews</NORP> and Pagans.
 (161) But the solution of this apparent difficulty is easy and obvious.
 The eloquent preacher draws a parallel between the civil and the ecclesiastical constitution of Antioch; between the list of <NORP>Christians</NORP> who had acquired heaven by baptism, and the list of citizens who had a right to share the public liberality.
 Slaves, strangers, and infants were comprised in the former; they were excluded from the latter.
 In Egypt.
 The extensive commerce of Alexandria, and its proximity to Palestine, gave an easy entrance to the new religion.
 It was at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> embraced by great numbers of the Therapeutae, or Essenians, of the lake Mareotis, a <NORP>Jewish</NORP> sect which had abated much of its reverence for the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> ceremonies.
 The austere life of the Essenians, their fasts and ex-communications, the community of goods, the love of celibacy, their zeal for martyrdom, and the warmth though not the purity of their faith, already offered a very lively image of the primitive discipline.
 (162) It was in the school of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> that the <NORP>Christian</NORP> theology appears to have assumed a regular and scientific form; and when <PERSON>Hadrian</PERSON> visited Egypt, he found a church composed of <NORP>Jews</NORP> and of Greeks, sufficiently important to attract the notice of that inquisitive prince.
 (163) But the progress of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was for a long time confined within the limits of a single city, which was itself a foreign colony, and till the close of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> century the predecessors of <PERSON>Demetrius</PERSON> were the only prelates of the <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> church.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> bishops were consecrated by the hands of Demetrius, and the number was increased to <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> by his successor Heraclas.
 (164) The body of the natives, a people distinguished by a sullen inflexibility of temper, (165) entertained the new doctrine with coldness and reluctance; and even in the time of <PERSON>Origen</PERSON> it was rare to meet with an <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> who had surmounted his early prejudices in favour of the sacred animals of his country.
 (166) As soon, indeed, as <NORP>Christianity</NORP> ascended the throne, the zeal of those barbarians obeyed the prevailing impulsion; the cities of <GPE>Egypt</GPE> were filled with bishops, and the deserts of <GPE>Thebais</GPE> swarmed with hermits.
 In Rome.
 A perpetual stream of strangers and provincials flowed into the capacious bosom of Rome.
 Whatever was strange or odious, whoever was guilty or suspected, might hope, in the obscurity of that immense capital, to elude the vigilance of the law.
 In such a various conflux of nations, every teacher, either of truth or of falsehood, every founder, whether of a virtuous or a criminal association, might easily multiply his disciples or accomplices.
 The <NORP>Christians</NORP> of Rome, at the time of the accidental persecution of Nero, are represented by <NORP>Tacitus</NORP> as already amounting to a very great multitude, (167) and the language of that great historian is almost similar to the style employed by Livy, when he relates the introduction and the suppression of the rites of Bacchus.
 After the <PERSON>Bacchanals</PERSON> had awakened the severity of the senate, it was likewise apprehended that a very great multitude, as it were another people, had been initiated into those abhorred mysteries.
 A more careful inquiry soon demonstrated that the offenders did not exceed <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> thousand; a number indeed sufficiently alarming when considered as the object of public justice.
 (168) It is with the same candid allowance that we should interpret the vague expressions of Tacitus, and in a former instance of Pliny, when they exaggerate the crowds of deluded fanatics who had forsaken the established worship of the gods.
 The church of <GPE>Rome</GPE> was undoubtedly the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most populous of the empire; and we are possessed of an authentic record which attests the state of religion in that city about the middle of the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> century, and after a peace of thirty-eight years.
 The clergy, at that time, consisted of a bishop, <CARDINAL>forty-six</CARDINAL> presbyters, <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> deacons, as many subdeacons, <CARDINAL>forty-two</CARDINAL> acolythes, and <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> readers, exorcists, and porters.
 The number of widows, of the infirm, and of the poor, who were maintained by the oblations of the faithful, amounted to <CARDINAL>fifteen</CARDINAL> hundred.
 (169) From reason, as well as from the analogy of Antioch, we may venture to estimate the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of <GPE>Rome</GPE> at about <CARDINAL>fifty</CARDINAL> thousand.
 The populousness of that great capital cannot perhaps be exactly ascertained; but the most modest calculation will not surely reduce it lower than a million of inhabitants, of whom the <NORP>Christians</NORP> might constitute at the most a <ORDINAL>twentieth</ORDINAL> part.
 (170) In <LOC>Africa</LOC> and the western provinces.
 The western provincials appeared to have derived the knowledge of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> from the same source which had diffused among them the language, the sentiments, and the manners of Rome.
 In this more important circumstance Africa, as well as Gaul, was gradually fashioned to the imitation of the capital.
 Yet notwithstanding the many favourable occasions which might invite the <NORP>Roman</NORP> missionaries to visit their <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> provinces, it was late before they passed either the sea or the Alps; (171) nor can we discover in those great countries any assured traces either of faith or of persecution that ascend higher than the reign of the Antonines.
 (172) The slow progress of the <LOC>Gospel</LOC> in the cold climate of <PERSON>Gaul</PERSON> was extremely different from the eagerness with which it seems to have been received on the burning sands of Africa.
 The <NORP>African</NORP> <NORP>Christians</NORP> soon formed <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the principal members of the primitive church.
 The practice introduced into that province of appointing bishops to the most inconsiderable towns, and very frequently to the most obscure villages, contributed to multiply the splendour and importance of their religious societies, which during the course of the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> century were animated by the zeal of Tertullian, directed by the abilities of Cyprian, and adorned by the eloquence of Lactantius.
 But if, on the contrary, we turn our eyes towards Gaul, we must content ourselves with discovering, in the time of <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> Antoninus, the feeble and united congregations of <GPE>Lyons</GPE> and Vienne; and even as late as the reign of <GPE>Decius</GPE> we are assured that in a few cities only - Arles, Narbonne, Toulouse, Limoges, Clermont, Tours, and <GPE>Paris</GPE> - some scattered churches were supported by the devotion of a small number of Christians.
 (173) Silence is indeed very consistent with devotion; but as it is seldom compatible with zeal we may perceive and lament the languid state of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> in those provinces which had exchanged the <NORP>Celtic</NORP> for the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> tongue, since they did not, during the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> centuries, give birth to a single ecclesiastical writer.
 From Gaul, which claimed a just pre-eminence of learning and authority over all the countries on this side of the Alps, the light of the <LOC>Gospel</LOC> was more faintly reflected on the remote provinces of <GPE>Spain</GPE> and Britain; and if we may credit the vehement assertions of Tertullian, they had already received the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rays of the faith when he addressed his Apology to the magistrates of the emperor Severus.
 (174) But the obscure and imperfect origin of the western churches of <LOC>Europe</LOC> had been so negligently recorded, that, if we would relate the time and manner of their foundation, we must supply the silence of antiquity by those legends which avarice or superstition long afterwards dictated to the monks in the lazy gloom of their convents.
 (175) Of these holy romances, that of the apostle St.
 James can alone, by its singular extravagance, deserve to be mentioned.
 From a peaceful fisherman of the lake of Gennesareth, he was transformed into a valorous knight, who charged at the head of the <NORP>Spanish</NORP> chivalry in their battles against the Moors.
 The gravest historians have celebrated his exploits; the miraculous shrine of <PERSON>Compostella</PERSON> displayed his power and the sword of a military order, assisted by the terrors of the Inquisition, was sufficient to remove every objection of profane criticism.
 (176) Beyond the limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 The progress of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> was not confined to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire; and, according to the primitive fathers, who interpret facts by prophecy, the new religion, within a century after the death of its Divine Author, had already visited every part of the globe.
 But this splendid exaggeration, which even at present it would be extremely difficult to reconcile with the real state of mankind, can be considered only as the rash sally of a devout but careless writer, the measure of whose belief was regulated by that of his wishes.
 But neither the belief nor the wishes of the fathers can alter the truth of history.
 It will still remain an undoubted fact that the barbarians of <GPE>Scythia</GPE> and Germany, who afterwards subverted the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarchy, were involved in the darkness of paganism; and that even the conversion of Iberia, of Armenia, or of Ethiopia, was not attempted with any degree of success until the sceptre was in the hands of an orthodox emperor (178) Before that time the various accidents of war and commerce might indeed diffuse an imperfect knowledge of the <LOC>Gospel</LOC> among the tribes of Caledonia, (179) and among the borderers of the Rhine, the Danube, and the Euphrates.
 (180) Beyond the last-mentioned river, <PERSON>Edessa</PERSON> was distinguished by a firm and early adherence to the faith.
 (181) From <PERSON>Edessa</PERSON> the principles of <NORP>Christianity</NORP> were easily introduced into the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> and <NORP>Syrian</NORP> cities which obeyed the successors of Artaxerxes; but they do not appear to have made any deep impression on the minds of the Persians, whose religious system, by the labours of a well-disciplined order of priests, had been constructed with much more art and solidity than the uncertain mythology of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and Rome.
 (182) General proportion of <NORP>Christians</NORP> and Pagans.
 From this impartial though imperfect survey of the progress of Christianity, it may perhaps seem probable that the number of its proselytes has been excessively magnified by fear on the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> side, and by devotion on the other.
 According to the irreproachable testimony of Origen, (183) the proportion of the faithful was very inconsiderable, when compared with the multitude of an unbelieving world; but, as we are left without any distinct information, it is impossible to determine, and it is difficult even to conjecture, the real numbers of the primitive Christians.
 The most favourable calculation, however, that can be deduced from the examples of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> and of <GPE>Rome</GPE> will not permit us to imagine that more than a <ORDINAL>twentieth</ORDINAL> part of the subjects of the empire had enlisted themselves under the banner of the Cross before the important conversion of Constantine.
 But their habits of faith, of zeal, and of union, seemed to multiply their numbers; and the same causes which contributed to their future increase served to render their actual strength more apparent and more formidable.
 Whether the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <NORP>Christians</NORP> were mean and ignorant.
 Such is the constitution of civil society, that, whilst a few persons are distinguished by riches, by honours, and by knowledge, the body of the people is condemned to obscurity, ignorance, and poverty.
 The <NORP>Christian</NORP> religion, which addressed itself to the whole human race, must consequently collect a far greater number of proselytes from the lower than from the superior ranks of life.
 This innocent and natural circumstance has been improved into a very odious imputation, which seems to be less strenuously denied by the apologists than it is urged by the adversaries of the faith; that the new sect of <NORP>Christians</NORP> was almost entirely composed of the dregs of the populace, of peasants and mechanics, of boys and women, of beggars and slaves, the last of whom might sometimes introduce the missionaries into the rich and noble families to which they belonged.
 These obscure teachers (such was the charge of malice and infidelity) are as mute in public as they are loquacious and dogmatical in private.
 Whilst they cautiously avoid the dangerous encounter of philosophers, they mingle with the rude and illiterate crowd, and insinuate themselves into those minds who their age, their sex, or their education has best disposed to receive the impression of superstitious terrors.
 (184) Some exceptions with regard to learning; This unfavourable picture, though not devoid of a faint resemblance, betrays, by its dark colouring and distorted features, the pencil of a enemy.
 As the humble faith of <PERSON>Christ</PERSON> diffused it self through the world, it was embraced by several persons who derived some consequence from the advantages of nature or fortune.
 Aristides, who presented an eloquent apology to the emperor Hadrian, was an <NORP>Athenian</NORP> philosopher.
 (185) <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> Martyr had sought divine knowledge in the schools of Zeno, of Aristotle, of <LOC>Pythagoras</LOC> and of Plato, before he fortunately was accosted by the old man, or rather the angel, who turned his attention to the study of the <NORP>Jewish</NORP> prophets.
 (186) <PERSON>Clemens</PERSON> of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> had acquired much various reading in the Greek, and <PERSON>Tertullian</PERSON> in the Latin, language.
 Julius Africanus and <PERSON>Origen</PERSON> possessed a very considerable share of the learning of their times; and although the style of <PERSON>Cyprian</PERSON> is very different from that of Lactantius, we might almost discover that both those writers had been public teachers of rhetoric.
 Even the study of philosophy was at length introduced among the Christians, but it was not always productive of the most salutary effects; knowledge was as often the parent of heresy as of devotion, and the description which was designed for the followers of <WORK_OF_ART>Artemon</WORK_OF_ART> may, with equal propriety, be applied to the various sects that resisted the successors of the apostles.
 with regard to rank and fortune.
 Nor can it be affirmed with truth that the advantages of birth and fortune were always separated from the profession of Christianity.
 Several <NORP>Roman</NORP> citizens were brought before the tribunal of Pliny, and he soon discovered that a great number of persons of every order of men in <GPE>Bithynia</GPE> had deserted the religion of their ancestors.
 (188) His unsuspected testimony may, in this instance, obtain more credit than the bold challenge of Tertullian, when he addresses himself to the fears as well as to the humanity of the proconsul of Africa, by assuring him that if he persists in his cruel intentions he must decimate Carthage, and that he will find among the guilty many persons of his own rank, senators and matrons of noblest extraction, and the friends or relations of his most intimate friends.
 (189) It appears, however, that about forty years afterwards the emperor <PERSON>Valerian</PERSON> was persuaded of the truth of this assertion, since in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his rescripts he evidently supposes that senators, <NORP>Roman</NORP> knights, and ladies of quality, were engaged in the <NORP>Christian</NORP> sect.
 (190) The church still continued to increase its outward splendour as it lost its internal purity; and, in the reign of Diocletian, the palace, the courts of justice, and even the army, concealed a multitude of Christians, who endeavoured to reconcile the interests of the present with those of a future life.
 <NORP>Christianity</NORP> most favourably received by the poor and simple.
 And yet these exceptions are either too few in number, or too recent in time, entirely to remove the imputation of ignorance and obscurity which has been so arrogantly cast on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> proselytes of Christianity.
 Instead of employing in our defence the fictions of later ages, it will be more prudent to convert the occasion of scandal into a subject of edification.
 Our serious thoughts will suggest to us that the apostles themselves were chosen by <GPE>Providence</GPE> among the fishermen of Galilee, and that, the lower we depress the temporal condition of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> Christians, the more reason we shall find to admire their merit and success.
 It is incumbent on us diligently to remember that the kingdom of heaven was promised to the poor in spirit, and that minds afflicted by calamity and the contempt of mankind cheerfully listen to the divine promise of future happiness; while, on the contrary, the fortunate are satisfied with the possession of this world; and the wise abuse in doubt and dispute their vain superiority of reason and knowledge.
 Rejected by some emminent men of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> centuries.
 We stand in need of such reflections to comfort us for the loss of some illustrious characters, which in our eyes might have seemed the most worthy of the heavenly present.
 The names of Seneca, of the elder and the younger Pliny, of Tacitus, of Plutarch, of Galen, of the slave Epictetus, and of the emperor <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> Antoninus, adorn the age in which they flourished, and exalt the dignity of human nature.
 They filled with glory their respective stations, either in active or contemplative life; their excellent understandings were improved by study; philosophy had purified their minds from the prejudices of the popular superstition; and their days were spent in the pursuit of truth and the practice of virtue.
 Yet all these sages (it is no less an object of surprise than of concern) overlooked or rejected the perfection of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> system.
 Their language or their silence equally discover their contempt for the growing sect which in their time had diffused itself over the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 Those among them who condescend to mention the <NORP>Christians</NORP> consider them only as obstinate and perverse enthusiasts, who exacted an implicit submission to their mysterious doctrines, without being able to produce a single argument that could engage the attention of men of sense and learning.
 (191) Their neglect of prophecy.
 It is at least doubtful whether any of these philosophers perused the apologies which the primitive <NORP>Christians</NORP> repeatedly published in behalf of themselves and of their religion; but it is much to be lamented that such a cause was not defended by abler advocates.
 They expose with superfluous wit and eloquence the extravagance of Polytheism.
 They interest our compassion by displaying the innocence and sufferings of their injured brethren.
 But when they would demonstrate the divine origin of Christianity, they insist much more strongly on the predictions which announced, than on the miracles which accompanied, the appearance of the Messiah.
 Their favourite argument might serve to edify a <NORP>Christian</NORP> or to convert a Jew, since both the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> and the other acknowledge the authority of those prophecies, and both are obliged, with devout reverence, to search for their sense and their accomplishment.
 But this mode of persuasion loses much of its weight and influence when it is addressed to those who neither understand nor respect the <NORP>Mosaic</NORP> dispensation and the prophetic style.
 (192) In the unskilful hands of <PERSON>Justin</PERSON> and of the succeeding apologists, the sublime meaning of the <LANGUAGE>Hebrew</LANGUAGE> oracles evaporates in distant types, affected conceits, and cold allegories; and even their authenticity was rendered suspicious to an unenlightened Gentile, by the mixture of pious forgeries which, under the names of Orpheus, Hermes, and the Sibyls, (193) were obtruded on him as of equal value with the genuine inspirations of Heaven.
 The adoption of fraud and sophistry in the defence of revelation too often reminds us of the injudicious conduct of those poets who load their invulnerable heroes with a useless weight of cumbersome and brittle armour.
 and of miracles.
 But how shall we excuse the supine inattention of the <NORP>Pagan</NORP> and philosophic world to those evidences which were presented by the hand of Omnipotence, not to their reason, but to their senses? During the age of Christ, of his apostles, and of their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> disciples, the doctrine which they preached was confirmed by innumerable prodigies.
 The lame walked, the blind saw, the sick were healed, the dead were raised, daemons were expelled, and the laws of <PERSON>Nature</PERSON> were frequently suspended for the benefit of the church.
 General silence concerning the darkness of the passion.
 But the sages of <GPE>Greece</GPE> and <GPE>Rome</GPE> turned aside from the awful spectacle, and, pursuing the ordinary occupations of life and study, appeared unconscious of any alterations in the moral or physical government of the world.
 Under the reign of Tiberius, the whole earth, (194) or at least a celebrated province of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, (195) was involved in a preternatural darkness of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hours.
 Even this miraculous event, which ought to have excited the wonder, the curiosity, and the devotion of mankind, passed without notice in an age of science and history.
 (196) It happened during the lifetime of <PERSON>Seneca</PERSON> and the elder Pliny, who must have experienced the immediate effects, or received the earliest intelligence, of the prodigy.
 Each of these philosophers, in a laborious work, has recorded all the great phenomena of Nature, earthquakes, meteors, comets, and eclipses, which his indefatigable curiosity could collect.
 (197) Both the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> and the other have omitted to mention the greatest phenomenon to which the mortal eye has been witness since the creation of the globe.
 A distinct chapter of <PERSON>Pliny</PERSON> (198) is designed for eclipses of an extraordinary nature and unusual duration; but he contents himself with describing the singular defect of light which followed the murder of Caesar, when, during the greatest part of a year, the orb of the sun appeared pale and without splendour.
 This season of obscurity, which cannot surely be compared with the preternatural darkness of the Passion, had been already celebrated by most of the poets (199) and historians of that memorable age.
