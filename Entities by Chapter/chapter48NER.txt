Plan of the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>Sixth</ORDINAL> Volumes.
 Succession and Characters of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> Emperors of Constantinople, from the time of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> to the <NORP>Latin</NORP> Conquest Defects of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> history.
 I have now deduced from <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> to Constantine, from <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to Heraclius, the regular series of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors; and faithfully exposed the prosperous and adverse fortunes of their reigns.
 Five centuries of the decline and fall of the empire have already elapsed; but a period of more than <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years still separates me from the term of my labours, the taking of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> by the Turks.
 Should I persevere in the same course, should I observe the same measure, a prolix and slender thread would be spun through many a volume, nor would the patient reader find an adequate reward of instruction or amusement.
 At every step, as we sink deeper in the decline and fall of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, the annals of each succeeding reign would impose a more ungrateful and melancholy task.
 These annals must continue to repeat a tedious and uniform tale of weakness and misery; the natural connection of causes and events would be broken by frequent and hasty transitions, and a minute accumulation of circumstances must destroy the light and effect of those general pictures which compose the use and ornament of a remote history.
 From the time of Heraclius, the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> theatre is contracted and darkened: the line of empire, which had been defined by the laws of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and the arms of Belisarius, recedes on all sides from our view; the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name, the proper subject of our inquiries, is reduced to a narrow corner of Europe, to the lonely suburbs of Constantinople; and the fate of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> empire has been compared to that of the Rhine, which loses itself in the sands, before its waters can mingle with the ocean.
 The scale of dominion is diminished to our view by the distance of time and place; nor is the loss of external splendour compensated by the nobler gifts of virtue and genius.
 In the last moments of her decay, <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was doubtless more opulent and populous than <GPE>Athens</GPE> at her most flourishing aera, when a scanty sum of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> talents, or <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds sterling was possessed by twenty-one <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> male citizens of an adult age.
 But each of these citizens was a freeman, who dared to assert the liberty of his thoughts, words, and actions, whose person and property were guarded by equal law; and who exercised his independent vote in the government of the republic.
 Their numbers seem to be multiplied by the strong and various discriminations of character; under the shield of freedom, on the wings of emulation and vanity, each <NORP>Athenian</NORP> aspired to the level of the national dignity; from this commanding eminence, some chosen spirits soared beyond the reach of a vulgar eye; and the chances of superior merit in a great and populous kingdom, as they are proved by experience, would excuse the computation of imaginary millions.
 The territories of Athens, Sparta, and their allies, do not exceed a moderate province of <GPE>France</GPE> or England; but after the trophies of <GPE>Salamis</GPE> and Platea, they expand in our fancy to the gigantic size of Asia, which had been trampled under the feet of the victorious Greeks.
 But the subjects of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire, who assume and dishonour the names both of <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Romans, present a dead uniformity of abject vices, which are neither softened by the weakness of humanity, nor animated by the vigour of memorable crimes.
 The freemen of antiquity might repeat with generous enthusiasm the sentence of Homer, "that on the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> day of his servitude, the captive is deprived of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> half of his manly virtue.
" But the poet had only seen the effects of civil or domestic slavery, nor could he foretell that the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> moiety of manhood must be annihilated by the spiritual despotism which shackles not only the actions, but even the thoughts, of the prostrate votary.
 By this double yoke, the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were oppressed under the successors of Heraclius; the tyrant, a law of eternal justice, was degraded by the vices of his subjects; and on the throne, in the camp, in the schools, we search, perhaps with fruitless diligence, the names and characters that may deserve to be rescued from oblivion.
 Nor are the defects of the subject compensated by the skill and variety of the painters.
 Of a space of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> centuries are overspread with a cloud interrupted by some faint and broken rays of historic light: in the lives of the emperors, from <PERSON>Maurice</PERSON> to Alexius, <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> has alone been the theme of a separate work; and the absence, or loss, or imperfection of contemporary evidence, must be poorly supplied by the doubtful authority of more recent compilers.
 The <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> last centuries are exempt from the reproach of penury; and with the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family, the historic muse of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> again revives, but her apparel is gaudy, her motions are without elegance or grace.
 A succession of priests, or courtiers, treads in each other's footsteps in the same path of servitude and superstition: their views are narrow, their judgment is feeble or corrupt; and we close the volume of copious barrenness, still ignorant of the causes of events, the characters of the actors, and the manners of the times which they celebrate or deplore.
 The observation which has been applied to a man, may be extended to a whole people, that the energy of the sword is communicated to the pen; and it will be found by experience, that the tone of history will rise or fall with the spirit of the age.
 Its connection with the revolutions of the world.
 From these considerations, I should have abandoned without regret the <NORP>Greek</NORP> slaves and their servile historians, had I not reflected that the fate of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> monarchy is passively connected with the most splendid and important revolutions which have changed the state of the world.
 The space of the lost provinces was immediately replenished with new colonies and rising kingdoms: the active virtues of peace and war deserted from the vanquished to the victorious nations; and it is in their origin and conquests, in their religion and government, that we must explore the causes and effects of the decline and fall of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 Nor will this scope of narrative, the riches and variety of these materials, be incompatible with the unity of design and composition.
 As, in his daily prayers, the Mussulman of Fez or <GPE>Delhi</GPE> still turns his face towards the temple of Mecca, the historian's eye shall be always fixed on the city of Constantinople.
 The excursive line may embrace the wilds of <GPE>Arabia</GPE> and Tartary, but the circle will be ultimately reduced to the decreasing limit of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> monarchy.
 Plan of the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> volumes.
 On this principle I shall now establish the plan of the last <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> volumes of the present work.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> chapter will contain, in a regular series, the emperors who reigned at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> during a period of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years, from the days of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> to the <NORP>Latin</NORP> conquest; a rapid abstract, which may be supported by a general appeal to the order and text of the original historians.
 In this introduction, I shall confine myself to the revolutions of the throne, the succession of families, the personal characters of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> princes, the mode of their life and death, the maxims and influence of their domestic government, and the tendency of their reign to accelerate or suspend the downfall of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 Such a chronological review will serve to illustrate the various argument of the subsequent chapters; and each circumstance of the eventful story of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> will adapt itself in a proper place to the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> annals.
 The internal state of the empire, and the dangerous heresy of the Paulicians, which shook the <LOC>East</LOC> and enlightened the West, will be the subject of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> separate chapters; but these inquiries must be postponed till our further progress shall have opened the view of the world in the ninth and tenth centuries of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> area.
 After this foundation of <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> history, the following nations will pass before our eyes, and each will occupy the space to which it may be entitled by greatness or merit, or the degree of connection with the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world and the present age.
 I.
 The Franks; a general appellation which includes all the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of France, Italy, and Germany, who were united by the sword and sceptre of Charlemagne.
 The persecution of images and their votaries separated <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Italy</GPE> from the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne, and prepared the restoration of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire in the West.
 II.
 The <NORP>Arabs</NORP> or Saracens.
 <CARDINAL>Three</CARDINAL> ample chapters will be devoted to this curious and interesting object.
 In the first, after a picture of the country and its inhabitants, I shall investigate the character of Mahomet; the character, religion, and success of the prophet.
 In the second, I shall lead the <NORP>Arabs</NORP> to the conquest of Syria, Egypt, and Africa, the provinces of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire; nor can I check their victorious career till they have overthrown the monarchies of <GPE>Persia</GPE> and Spain.
 In the third, I shall inquire how <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and <LOC>Europe</LOC> were saved by the luxury and arts, the division and decay, of the empire of the caliphs.
 A single chapter will include, III.
 The Bulgarians, IV.
 Hungarians, and, V.
 Russians, who assaulted by sea or by land the provinces and the capital; but the last of these, so important in their present greatness, will excite some curiosity in their origin and infancy.
 VI.
 The Normans; or rather the private adventurers of that warlike people, who founded a powerful kingdom in <GPE>Apulia</GPE> and Sicily, shook the throne of Constantinople, displayed the trophies of chivalry, and almost realized the wonders of romance.
 VII.
 The Latins; the subjects of the pope, the nations of the West, who enlisted under the banner of the cross for the recovery or relief of the holy sepulchre.
 The <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors were terrified and preserved by the myriads of pilgrims who marched to <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> with <PERSON>Godfrey</PERSON> of <PERSON>Bouillon</PERSON> and the peers of Christendom.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> crusades trod in the footsteps of the first: <LOC>Asia</LOC> and <LOC>Europe</LOC> were mingled in a sacred war of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years; and the <NORP>Christian</NORP> powers were bravely resisted, and finally expelled by <PERSON>Saladin</PERSON> and the <PERSON>Mamelukes</PERSON> of Egypt.
 In these memorable crusades, a fleet and army of <NORP>French</NORP> and <NORP>Venetians</NORP> were diverted from <GPE>Syria</GPE> to the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> Bosphorus: they assaulted the capital, they subverted the <NORP>Greek</NORP> monarchy: and a dynasty of <NORP>Latin</NORP> princes was seated near threescore years on the throne of Constantine.
 VII.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> themselves, during this period of captivity and exile, must be considered as a foreign nation; the enemies, and again the sovereigns of Constantinople.
 Misfortune had rekindled a spark of national virtue; and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> series may be continued with some dignity from their restoration to the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> conquest.
 IX.
 The <ORG>Moguls</ORG> and Tartars.
 By the arms of <PERSON>Zingis</PERSON> and his descendants, the globe was shaken from <GPE>China</GPE> to <GPE>Poland</GPE> and Greece: the sultans were overthrown: the caliphs fell, and the <LOC>Caesars</LOC> trembled on their throne.
 The victories of <PERSON>Timour</PERSON> suspended above fifty years the final ruin of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire.
 X.
 I have already noticed the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> appearance of the Turks; and the names of the fathers, of <GPE>Seljuk</GPE> and Othman, discriminate the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> successive dynasties of the nation, which emerged in the eleventh century from the <PERSON>Scythian</PERSON> wilderness.
 The former established a splendid and potent kingdom from the banks of the <LOC>Oxus</LOC> to <GPE>Antioch</GPE> and Nice; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade was provoked by the violation of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> and the danger of Constantinople.
 From an humble origin, the <NORP>Ottomans</NORP> arose, the scourge and terror of Christendom.
 <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was besieged and taken by <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> II.
, and his triumph annihilates the remnant, the image, the title, of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire in the East.
 The schism of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> will be connected with their last calamities, and the restoration of learning in the <NORP>Western</NORP> world.
 I shall return from the captivity of the new, to the ruins of ancient Rome; and the venerable name, the interesting theme, will shed a ray of glory on the conclusion of my labours.
Second marriage and death of Heraclius.
 The emperor <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> had punished a tyrant and ascended his throne; and the memory of his reign is perpetuated by the transient conquest, and irreparable loss, of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> provinces.
 After the death of Eudocia, his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife, he disobeyed the patriarch, and violated the laws, by his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> marriage with his niece Martina; and the superstition of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> beheld the judgment of Heaven in the diseases of the father and the deformity of his offspring.
 But the opinion of an illegitimate birth is sufficient to distract the choice, and loosen the obedience, of the people: the ambition of <PERSON>Martina</PERSON> was quickened by maternal love, and perhaps by the envy of a step- mother; and the aged husband was too feeble to withstand the arts of conjugal allurements.
 Constantine, his eldest son, enjoyed in a mature age the title of Augustus; but the weakness of his constitution required a colleague and a guardian, and he yielded with secret reluctance to the partition of the empire.
 A.
D.
 638, July 4.
 The senate was summoned to the palace to ratify or attest the association of Heracleonas, the son of Martina: the imposition of the diadem was consecrated by the prayer and blessing of the patriarch; the senators and patricians adored the majesty of the great emperor and the partners of his reign; and as soon as the doors were thrown open, they were hailed by the tumultuary but important voice of the soldiers.
 A.
D.
 639, January.
 After an interval of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> months, the pompous ceremonies which formed the essence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> state were celebrated in the cathedral and the hippodrome; the concord of the royal brothers was affectedly displayed by the younger leaning on the arm of the elder; and the name of <PERSON>Martina</PERSON> was mingled in the reluctant or venal acclamations of the people.
 A.
D.
 641, <DATE>February</DATE> 11.
 <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> survived this association about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years: his last testimony declared his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons the equal heirs of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire, and commanded them to honour his widow <PERSON>Martina</PERSON> as their mother and their sovereign.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> III.
, A.
D.
 641, February.
 When <PERSON>Martina</PERSON> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> appeared on the throne with the name and attributes of royalty, she was checked by a firm, though respectful, opposition; and the dying embers of freedom were kindled by the breath of superstitious prejudice.
Martina descended from the throne with indignation, and sought a refuge in the female apartment of the palace.
 The reign of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> lasted only <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days: he expired in the thirtieth year of his age, and, although his life had been a long malady, a belief was entertained Heracleonas, A.
D.
 641, <DATE>May</DATE> 25.
 that poison had been the means, and his cruel step-mother the author, of his untimely fate.
 <PERSON>Martina</PERSON> reaped indeed the harvest of his death, and assumed the government in the name of the surviving emperor; but the incestuous widow of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> was universally abhorred; the jealousy of the people was awakened, and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> orphans whom <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had left became the objects of the public care.
 It was in vain that the son of Martina, who was no more than fifteen years of age, was taught to declare himself the guardian of his nephews, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of whom he had presented at the baptismal font: it was in vain that he swore on the wood of the true cross, to defend them against all their enemies.
 On his death-bed, the late emperor had despatched a trusty servant to arm the troops and provinces of the <LOC>East</LOC> in the defence of his helpless children: the eloquence and liberality of <PERSON>Valentin</PERSON> had been successful, and from his camp of Chalcedon, he boldly demanded the punishment of the assassins, and the restoration of the lawful heir.
 The license of the soldiers, who devoured the grapes and drank the wine of their <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> vineyards, provoked the citizens of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> against the domestic authors of their calamities, and the dome of St.
 Sophia reechoed, not with prayers and hymns, but with the clamours and imprecations of an enraged multitude.
 At their imperious command, <PERSON>Heracleonas</PERSON> appeared in the pulpit with the eldest of the royal orphans; <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> alone was saluted as emperor of the Romans, and a crown of gold, which had been taken from the tomb of Heraclius, was placed on his head, with the solemn benediction of the patriarch.
 But in the tumult of joy and indignation, the church was pillaged, the sanctuary was polluted by a promiscuous crowd of <NORP>Jews</NORP> and Barbarians; and the <NORP>Monothelite</NORP> Pyrrhus, a creature of the empress, after dropping a protestation on the altar, escaped by a prudent flight from the zeal of the Catholics.
 A more serious and bloody task was reserved for the senate, who derived a temporary strength from the consent of the soldiers and people.
 The spirit of <NORP>Roman</NORP> freedom revived the ancient and awful examples of the judgment of tyrants, and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> culprits were deposed and condemned as the authors of the death of Constantine.
 But the severity of the conscript fathers was stained by the indiscriminate punishment of the innocent and the guilty: Punishment of <PERSON>Martina</PERSON> and Heracleonas, A.
D.
 641, September.
 <PERSON>Martina</PERSON> and <PERSON>Heracleonas</PERSON> were sentenced to the amputation, the former of her tongue, the latter of his nose; and after this cruel execution, they consumed the remainder of their days in exile and oblivion.
 The <NORP>Greeks</NORP> who were capable of reflection might find some consolation for their servitude, by observing the abuse of power when it was lodged for a moment in the hands of an aristocracy.
 <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> II.
, A.
D.
 641, September.
 We shall imagine ourselves transported <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years backwards to the age of the Antonines, if we listen to the oration which <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> II.
 pronounced in the twelfth year of his age before the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> senate.
 After returning his thanks for the just punishment of the assassins, who had intercepted the fairest hopes of his father's reign,The senators were gratified by the respectful address and liberal donative of their sovereign; but these servile <NORP>Greeks</NORP> were unworthy and regardless of freedom; and in his mind, the lesson of an hour was quickly erased by the prejudices of the age and the habits of despotism.
 He retained only a jealous fear lest the senate or people should <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day invade the right of primogeniture, and seat his brother <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> on an equal throne.
 By the imposition of holy orders, the grandson of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> was disqualified for the purple; but this ceremony, which seemed to profane the sacraments of the church, was insufficient to appease the suspicions of the tyrant, and the death of the deacon <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> could alone expiate the crime of his royal birth.
 His murder was avenged by the imprecations of the people, and the assassin, in the fullness of power, was driven from his capital into voluntary and perpetual exile.
 <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> embarked for <GPE>Greece</GPE> and, as if he meant to retort the abhorrence which he deserved he is said, from the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> galley, to have spit against the walls of his native city.
 After passing the winter at Athens, he sailed to <GPE>Tarentum</GPE> in Italy, visited Rome, and concluded a long pilgrimage of disgrace and sacrilegious rapine, by fixing his residence at Syracuse.
 But if <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> could fly from his people, he could not fly from himself.
 The remorse of his conscience created a phantom who pursued him by land and sea, by day and by night; and the visionary Theodosius, presenting to his lips a cup of blood, said, or seemed to say, "Drink, brother, drink;" a sure emblem of the aggravation of his guilt, since he had received from the hands of the deacon the mystic cup of the blood of Christ.
 <PERSON>Odious</PERSON> to himself and to mankind, <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> perished by domestic, perhaps by episcopal, treason, in the capital of Sicily.
 A servant who waited in the bath, after pouring warm water on his head, struck him violently with the vase.
 He fell, stunned by the blow, and suffocated by the water; and his attendants, who wondered at the tedious delay, beheld with indifference the corpse of their lifeless emperor.
 The troops of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> invested with the purple an obscure youth, whose inimitable beauty eluded, and it might easily elude, the declining art of the painters and sculptors of the age.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> IV.
, Pogonatus, A.
D.
 688, September.
 <PERSON>Constans</PERSON> had left in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons, the eldest of whom had been clothed in his infancy with the purple.
 When the father summoned them to attend his person in Sicily, these precious hostages were detained by the Greeks, and a firm refusal informed him that they were the children of the state.
 The news of his murder was conveyed with almost supernatural speed from <GPE>Syracuse</GPE> to Constantinople; and Constantine, the eldest of his sons, inherited his throne without being the heir of the public hatred.
 His subjects contributed, with zeal and alacrity, to chastise the guilt and presumption of a province which had usurped the rights of the senate and people; the young emperor sailed from the <GPE>Hellespont</GPE> with a powerful fleet; and the legions of <GPE>Rome</GPE> and <GPE>Carthage</GPE> were assembled under his standard in the harbor of Syracuse.
 The defeat of the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> tyrant was easy, his punishment just, and his beauteous head was exposed in the hippodrome: but I cannot applaud the clemency of a prince, who, among a crowd of victims, condemned the son of a patrician, for deploring with some bitterness the execution of a virtuous father.
 The youth was castrated: he survived the operation, and the memory of this indecent cruelty is preserved by the elevation of <PERSON>Germanus</PERSON> to the rank of a patriarch and saint.
 After pouring this bloody libation on his father's tomb, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> returned to his capital; and the growth of his young beard during the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> voyage was announced, by the familiar surname of Pogonatus, to the <NORP>Grecian</NORP> world.
 But his reign, like that of his predecessor, was stained with fraternal discord.
 On his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers, <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> and Tiberius, he had bestowed the title of Augustus; an empty title, for they continued to languish, without trust or power, in the solitude of the palace.
 At their secret instigation, the troops of the <NORP>Anatolian</NORP> theme or province approached the city on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> side, demanded for the royal brothers the partition or exercise of sovereignty, and supported their seditious claim by a theological argument.
 They were Christians, (they cried,) and orthodox Catholics; the sincere votaries of the holy and undivided Trinity.
 Since there are <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> equal persons in heaven, it is reasonable there should be <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> equal persons upon earth.
 The emperor invited these learned divines to a friendly conference, in which they might propose their arguments to the senate: they obeyed the summons, but the prospect of their bodies hanging on the gibbet in the suburb of <GPE>Galata</GPE> reconciled their companions to the unity of the reign of Constantine.
 He pardoned his brothers, and their names were still pronounced in the public acclamations: but on the repetition or suspicion of a similar offence, the obnoxious princes were deprived of their titles and noses, in the presence of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> bishops who were assembled at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> in the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> general synod.
 In the close of his life, <PERSON>Pogonatus</PERSON> was anxious only to establish the right of primogeniture: the heir of his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> and Heraclius, was offered on the shrine of St.
 Peter, as a symbol of their spiritual adoption by the pope; but the elder was alone exalted to the rank of Augustus, and the assurance of the empire.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> II.
, A.
D.
 685, September.
 After the decease of his father, the inheritance of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world devolved to <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> II.
; and the name of a triumphant lawgiver was dishonored by the vices of a boy, who imitated his namesake only in the expensive luxury of building.
 His passions were strong; his understanding was feeble; and he was intoxicated with a foolish pride, that his birth had given him the command of millions, of whom the smallest community would not have chosen him for their local magistrate.
 His favourite ministers were <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> beings the least susceptible of human sympathy, a eunuch and a monk: to the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> he abandoned the palace, to the other the finances; the former corrected the emperor's mother with a scourge, the latter suspended the insolvent tributaries, with their heads downwards, over a slow and smoky fire.
 Since the days of <EVENT>Commodus</EVENT> and Caracalla, the cruelty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes had most commonly been the effect of their fear; but Justinian, who possessed some vigour of character, enjoyed the sufferings, and braved the revenge, of his subjects, about ten years, till the measure was full, of his crimes and of their patience.
 In a dark dungeon, Leontius, a general of reputation, had groaned above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, with some of the noblest and most deserving of the patricians: he was suddenly drawn forth to assume the government of Greece; and this promotion of an injured man was a mark of the contempt rather than of the confidence of his prince.
 As he was followed to the port by the kind offices of his friends, <PERSON>Leontius</PERSON> observed, with a sigh, that he was a victim adorned for sacrifice, and that inevitable death would pursue his footsteps.
 They ventured to reply, that glory and empire might be the recompense of a generous resolution; that every order of men abhorred the reign of a monster; and that the hands of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> patriots expected only the voice of a leader.
 The night was chosen for their deliverance; and in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> effort of the conspirators, the praefect was slain, and the prisons were forced open: the emissaries of <PERSON>Leontius</PERSON> proclaimed in every street, "Christians, to St.
 Sophia!" and the seasonable text of the patriarch, "This is the day of the Lord!" was the prelude of an inflammatory sermon.
 From the church the people adjourned to the hippodrome: Justinian, in whose cause not a sword had been drawn, was dragged before these tumultuary judges, and their clamours demanded the instant death of the tyrant.
 But Leontius, who was already clothed with the purple, cast an eye of pity on the prostrate son of his own benefactor and of so many emperors.
 The life of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> was spared; the amputation of his nose, perhaps of his tongue, was imperfectly performed: the happy flexibility of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language could impose the name of Rhinotmetus; and the mutilated tyrant was banished to Chersonae in Crim-Tartary, a lonely settlement, where corn, wine, and oil, were imported as foreign luxuries.
 His exile, A.
D.
 695-705.
 On the edge of the <PERSON>Scythian</PERSON> wilderness, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> still cherished the pride of his birth, and the hope of his restoration.
 After <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years' exile, he received the pleasing intelligence that his injury was avenged by a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> revolution, and that <PERSON>Leontius</PERSON> in his turn had been dethroned and mutilated by the rebel Apsimar, who assumed the more respectable name of Tiberius.
 But the claim of lineal succession was still formidable to a plebeian usurper; and his jealousy was stimulated by the complaints and charges of the Chersonites, who beheld the vices of the tyrant in the spirit of the exile.
 With a band of followers, attached to his person by common hope or common despair, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> fled from the inhospitable shore to the horde of the Chozars, who pitchedtheir tents between the <FAC>Tanais</FAC> and Borysthenes.
 The khan entertained with pity and respect the royal suppliant: Phanagoria, once an opulent city, on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> side of the lake Moeotis, was assigned for his residence; and every <NORP>Roman</NORP> prejudice was stifled in his marriage with the sister of the Barbarian, who seems, however, from the name of Theodora, to have received the sacrament of baptism.
 But the faithless <PERSON>Chozar</PERSON> was soon tempted by the gold of Constantinople: and had not the design been revealed by the conjugal love of Theodora, her husband must have been assassinated or betrayed into the power of his enemies.
 After strangling, with his own hands, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emissaries of the khan, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> sent back his wife to her brother, and embarked on the <LOC>Euxine</LOC> in search of new and more faithful allies.
 His vessel was assaulted by a violent tempest; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his pious companions advised him to deserve the mercy of God by a vow of general forgiveness, if he should be restored to the throne.
 He survived this impious menace, sailed into the mouth of the Danube, trusted his person in the royal village of the Bulgarians, and purchased the aid of Terbelis, a pagan conqueror, by the promise of his daughter and a fair partition of the treasures of the empire.
 The <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> kingdom extended to the confines of Thrace; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes besieged <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> at the head of fifteen <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> horse.
 <PERSON>Apsimar</PERSON> was dismayed by the sudden and hostile apparition of his rival whose head had been promised by the Chozar, and of whose evasion he was yet ignorant.
 After an absence of ten years, the crimes of <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> were faintly remembered, and the birth and misfortunes of their hereditary sovereign excited the pity of the multitude, ever discontented with the ruling powers; and by the active diligence of his adherents, he was introduced into the city and palace of Constantine.
 His restoration and death, A.
D.
 705-711.
 In rewarding his allies, and recalling his wife, <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> displayed some sense of honour and gratitude; and <PERSON>Terbelis</PERSON> retired, after sweeping away a heap of gold coin, which he measured with his <PERSON>Scythian</PERSON> whip.
 But never was vow more religiously performed than the sacred oath of revenge which he had sworn amidst the storms of the Euxine.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> usurpers (for I must reserve the name of tyrant for the conqueror) were dragged into the hippodrome, the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> from his prison, the other from his palace.
 Before their execution, <PERSON>Leontius</PERSON> and <PERSON>Apsimar</PERSON> were cast prostrate in chains beneath the throne of the emperor; and Justinian, planting a foot on each of their necks, contemplated above an hour the chariot-race, while the inconstant people shouted, in the words of the Psalmist, The universal defection which he had once experienced might provoke him to repeat the wish of Caligula, that the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people had but <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> head.
 Yet I shall presume to observe, that such a wish is unworthy of an ingenious tyrant, since his revenge and cruelty would have been extinguished by a single blow, instead of the slow variety of tortures which <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> inflicted on the victims of his anger.
 His pleasures were inexhaustible: neither private virtue nor public service could expiate the guilt of active, or even passive, obedience to an established government; and, during the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years of his new reign, he considered the axe, the cord, and the rack, as the only instruments of royalty.
 But his most implacable hatred was pointed against the Chersonites, who had insulted his exile and violated the laws of hospitality.
 Their remote situation afforded some means of defence, or at least of escape; and a grievous tax was imposed on Constantinople, to supply the preparations of a fleet and army.
 "All are guilty, and all must perish," was the mandate of Justinian; and the bloody execution was entrusted to his favourite Stephen, who was recommended by the epithet of the savage.
 Yet even the savage <PERSON>Stephen</PERSON> imperfectly accomplished the intentions of his sovereign.
 The slowness of his attack allowed the greater part of the inhabitants to withdraw into the country; and the minister of vengeance contented himself with reducing the youth of both sexes to a state of servitude, with roasting alive <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> of the principal citizens, with drowning <DATE>twenty</DATE> in the sea, and with reserving <CARDINAL>forty-two</CARDINAL> in chains to receive their doom from the mouth of the emperor.
 In their return, the fleet was driven on the rocky shores of Anatolia; and <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> applauded the obedience of the Euxine, which had involved so many thousands of his subjects and enemies in a common shipwreck: but the tyrant was still insatiate of blood; and a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> expedition was commanded to extirpate the remains of the proscribed colony.
 In the short interval, the <PERSON>Chersonites</PERSON> had returned to their city, and were prepared to die in arms; the khan of the <NORP>Chozars</NORP> had renounced the cause of his odious brother; the exiles of every province were assembled in Tauris; and Bardanes, under the name of Philippicus, was invested with the purple.
 The <NORP>Imperial</NORP> troops, unwilling and unable to perpetrate the revenge of Justinian, escaped his displeasure by abjuring his allegiance: the fleet, under their new sovereign, steered back a more auspicious course to the harbours of <GPE>Sinope</GPE> and Constantinople; and every tongue was prompt to pronounce, every hand to execute, the death of the tyrant.
 Destitute of friends, he was deserted by his <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> guards; and the stroke of the assassin was praised as an act of patriotism and <NORP>Roman</NORP> virtue.
 His son <PERSON>Tiberius</PERSON> had taken refuge in a church; his aged grandmother guarded the door; and the innocent youth, suspending round his neck the most formidable relics, embraced with <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hand the altar, with the other the wood of the true cross.
 But the popular fury that dares to trample on superstition, is deaf to the cries of humanity; and the race of <PERSON>Heraclius</PERSON> was extinguished after a reign of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years Philippicus, A.
D.
 711, December.
 Between the fall of the <NORP>Heraclian</NORP> and the rise of the <NORP>Isaurian</NORP> dynasty, a short interval of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years is divided into <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> reigns.
 Bardanes, or Philippicus, was hailed at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> as a hero who had delivered his country from a tyrant; and he might taste some moments of happiness in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> transports of sincere and universal joy.
 <PERSON>Justinian</PERSON> had left behind him an ample treasure, the fruit of cruelty and rapine: but this useful fund was soon and idly dissipated by his successor.
 On the festival of his birthday, <PERSON>Philippicus</PERSON> entertained the multitude with the games of the hippodrome; from thence he paraded through the streets with a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> banners and a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> trumpets; refreshed himself in the baths of Zeuxippus, and returning to the palace, entertained his nobles with a sumptuous banquet.
 At the meridian hour he withdrew to his chamber, intoxicated with flattery and wine, and forgetful that his example had made every subject ambitious, and that every ambitious subject was his secret enemy.
 Some bold conspirators introduced themselves in the disorder of the feast; and the slumbering monarch was surprised, bound, blinded, and deposed, before he was sensible of his danger.
 Yet the traitors were deprived of their reward; and the free voice of the senate and people promoted <PERSON>Artemius</PERSON> from the office of secretary to that of emperor: he assumed the title of A.
D.
 713, June 4.
 <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> the Second, and displayed in a short and troubled reign the virtues both of peace and war.
 But after the extinction of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> line, the rule of obedience was violated, and every change diffused the seeds of new revolutions.
 In a mutiny of the fleet, an obscure and reluctant officer of the revenue was forcibly invested with the purple: after some months of a naval war, <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> resigned the sceptre; and the conqueror, A.
D.
 716, January.
 <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> the Third, submitted in his turn to the superior ascendant of Leo, the general and emperor of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> troops.
 His <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> predecessors were permitted to embrace the ecclesiastical profession: the restless impatience of <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> tempted him to risk and to lose his life in a treasonable enterprise; but the last days of <GPE>Theodosius</GPE> were honourable and secure.
 The single sublime word, "Health," which he inscribed on his tomb, expresses the confidence of philosophy or religion; and the fame of his miracles was long preserved among the people of Ephesus.
 This convenient shelter of the church might sometimes impose a lesson of clemency; but it may be questioned whether it is for the public interest to diminish the perils of unsuccessful ambition.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> III.
 The Isaurian, A.
D.
 718, March 25.
 I have dwelt on the fall of a tyrant; I shall briefly represent the founder of a new dynasty, who is known to posterity by the invectives of his enemies, and whose public and private life is involved in the ecclesiastical story of the Iconoclasts.
 Yet in spite of the clamours of superstition, a favourable prejudice for the character of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the <NORP>Isaurian</NORP> may be reasonably drawn from the obscurity of his birth, and the duration of his reign.
 - I.
 In an age of manly spirit, the prospect of an <NORP>Imperial</NORP> reward would have kindled every energy of the mind, and produced a crowd of competitors as deserving as they were desirous to reign.
 Even in the corruption and debility of the modern Greeks, the elevation of a plebeian from the last to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> rank of society, supposes some qualifications above the level of the multitude.
 He would probably be ignorant and disdainful of speculative science; and, in the pursuit of fortune, he might absolve himself from the obligations of benevolence and justice; but to his character we may ascribe the useful virtues of prudence and fortitude, the knowledge of mankind, and the important art of gaining their confidence and directing their passions.
 It is agreed that <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> was a native of Isauria, and that <PERSON>Conon</PERSON> was his primitive name.
 The writers, whose awkward satire is praise, describe him as an itinerant pedlar, who drove an ass with some paltry merchandise to the country fairs; and foolishly relate that he met on the road some <NORP>Jewish</NORP> fortune-tellers, who promised him the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, on condition that he should abolish the worship of idols.
 A more probable account relates the migration of his father from <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor to Thrace, where he exercised the lucrative trade of a grazier; and he must have acquired considerable wealth, since the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> introduction of his son was procured by a supply of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> sheep to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> service was in the guards of Justinian, where he soon attracted the notice, and by degrees the jealousy, of the tyrant.
 His valour and dexterity were conspicuous in the Colchian war: from <PERSON>Anastasius</PERSON> he received the command of the <NORP>Anatolian</NORP> legions, and by the suffrage of the soldiers he was raised to the empire with the general applause of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 - II.
 In this dangerous elevation, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> supported himself against the envy of his equals, the discontent of a powerful faction, and the assaults of his foreign and domestic enemies.
 The Catholics, who accuse his religious innovations, are obliged to confess that they were undertaken with temper and conducted with firmness.
 Their silence respects the wisdom of his administration and the purity of his manners.
 After a reign of twenty-four years, he peaceably expired in the palace of Constantinople; and the purple which he had acquired was transmitted by the right of inheritance to the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> generation.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> V.
 Copronymus, A.
D.
 741, June 18.
 In a long reign of thirty-four years, the son and successor of Leo, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the Fifth, surnamed Copronymus, attacked with less temperate zeal the images or idols of the church.
 Their votaries have exhausted the bitterness of religious gall, in their portrait of this spotted panther, this antichrist, this flying dragon of the serpent's seed, who surpassed the vices of <PERSON>Elagabalus</PERSON> and Nero.
 His reign was a long butchery of whatever was most noble, or holy, or innocent, in his empire.
 In person, the emperor assisted at the execution of his victims, surveyed their agonies, listened to their groans, and indulged, without satiating, his appetite for blood: a plate of noses was accepted as a grateful offering, and his domestics were often scourged or mutilated by the royal hand.
 His surname was derived from his pollution of his baptismal font.
 The infant might be excused; but the manly pleasures of <PERSON>Copronymus</PERSON> degraded him below the level of a brute; his lust confounded the eternal distinctions of sex and species, and he seemed to extract some unnatural delight from the objects most offensive to human sense.
 In his religion the <NORP>Iconoclast</NORP> was a Heretic, a Jew, a Mahometan, a Pagan, and an Atheist; and his belief of an invisible power could be discovered only in his magic rites, human victims, and nocturnal sacrifices to <PERSON>Venus</PERSON> and the daemons of antiquity.
 His life was stained with the most opposite vices, and the ulcers which covered his body, anticipated before his death the sentiment of hell-tortures.
 Of these accusations, which I have so patiently copied, a part is refuted by its own absurdity; and in the private anecdotes of the life of the princes, the lie is more easy as the detection is more difficult.
 Without adopting the pernicious maxim, that where much is alleged, something must be true, I can however discern, that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Fifth</ORDINAL> was dissolute and cruel.
 <PERSON>Calumny</PERSON> is more prone to exaggerate than to invent; and her licentious tongue is checked in some measure by the experience of the age and country to which she appeals.
 Of the bishops and monks, the generals and magistrates, who are said to have suffered under his reign, the numbers are recorded, the names were conspicuous, the execution was public, the mutilation visible and permanent.
 The <NORP>Catholics</NORP> hated the person and government of Copronymus; but even their hatred is a proof of their oppression.
 They dissembled the provocations which might excuse or justify his rigour, but even these provocations must gradually inflame his resentment and harden his temper in the use or the abuse of despotism.
 Yet the character of the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was not devoid of merit, nor did his government always deserve the curses or the contempt of the Greeks.
 From the confession of his enemies, I am informed of the restoration of an ancient aqueduct, of the redemption of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> captives, of the uncommon plenty of the times, and of the new colonies with which he repeopled <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> cities.
 They reluctantly praise his activity and courage; he was on horseback in the field at the head of his legions; and, although the fortune of his arms was various, he triumphed by sea and land, on the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> and the Danube, in civil and <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> war.
 Heretical praise must be cast into the scale to counterbalance the weight of orthodox invective.
 The <NORP>Iconoclasts</NORP> revered the virtues of the prince: <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> years after his death they still prayed before the tomb of the saint.
 A miraculous vision was propagated by fanaticism or fraud: and the <NORP>Christian</NORP> hero appeared on a milk-white steed, brandishing his lance against the <NORP>Pagans</NORP> of Bulgaria:Leo IV, A.
D.
 715, Sept.
 14.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Fourth, the son of the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> and the father of the <ORDINAL>sixth</ORDINAL> Constantine, was of a feeble constitution both of mind and body, and the principal care of his reign was the settlement of the succession.
 The association of the young <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was urged by the officious zeal of his subjects; and the emperor, conscious of his decay, complied, after a prudent hesitation, with their unanimous wishes.
 The royal infant, at the age of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years, was crowned with his mother Irene; and the national consent was ratified by every circumstance of pomp and solemnity, that could dazzle the eyes or bind the conscience of the Greeks.
 An oath of fidelity was administered in the palace, the church, and the hippodrome, to the several orders of the state, who adjured the holy names of the Son, and mother of God.
They pledged their faith on the wood of the true cross, and the act of their engagement was deposited on the altar of St.
 Sophia.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to swear, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to violate their oath, were the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> sons of <PERSON>Copronymus</PERSON> by a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> marriage; and the story of these princes is singular and tragic.
 The right of primogeniture excluded them from the throne; the injustice of their elder brother defrauded them of a legacy of about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> sterling; some vain titles were not deemed a sufficient compensation for wealth and power; and they repeatedly conspired against their nephew, before and after the death of his father.
 Their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attempt was pardoned; for the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> offence they were condemned to the ecclesiastical state; and for the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> treason, Nicephorus, the eldest and most guilty, was deprived of his eyes, and his <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> brothers, Christopher, Nicetas, Anthemeus, and Eudoxas, were punished, as a milder sentence, by the amputation of their tongues.
 After <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years' confinement, they escaped to the church of St.
 Sophia, and displayed a pathetic spectacle to the people.
The rising murmur might have produced a revolution, had it not been checked by the presence of a minister, who soothed the unhappy princes with flattery and hope, and gently drew them from the sanctuary to the palace.
 They were speedily embarked for Greece, and <GPE>Athens</GPE> was allotted for the place of their exile.
 In this calm retreat, and in their helpless condition, <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> and his brothers were tormented by the thirst of power, and tempted by a <NORP>Sclavonian</NORP> chief, who offered to break their prison, and to lead them in arms, and in the purple, to the gates of Constantinople.
 But the <NORP>Athenian</NORP> people, ever zealous in the cause of Irene, prevented her justice or cruelty; and the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> sons of <PERSON>Copronymus</PERSON> were plunged in eternal darkness and oblivion.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> VI.
 And Irene, A.
D.
 780, <DATE>September</DATE> 8.
 For himself, that emperor had chosen a <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> wife, the daughter of the khan of the Chozars; but in the marriage of his heir, he preferred an <NORP>Athenian</NORP> virgin, an orphan, seventeen years old, whose sole fortune must have consisted in her personal accomplishments.
 The nuptials of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> were celebrated with royal pomp; she soon acquired the love and confidence of a feeble husband, and in his testament he declared the empress guardian of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, and of their son <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the Sixth, who was no more than ten years of age.
 During his childhood, <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> most ably and assiduously discharged, in her public administration, the duties of a faithful mother; and her zeal in the restoration of images has deserved the name and honours of a saint, which she still occupies in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> calendar.
 But the emperor attained the maturity of youth; the maternal yoke became more grievous; and he listened to the favourites of his own age, who shared his pleasures, and were ambitious of sharing his power.
 Their reasons convinced him of his right, their praises of his ability, to reign; and he consented to reward the services of <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> by a perpetual banishment to the Isle of Sicily.
 But her vigilance and penetration easily disconcerted their rash projects: a similar, or more severe, punishment was retaliated on themselves and their advisers; and <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> inflicted on the ungrateful prince the chastisement of a boy.
 After this contest, the mother and the son were at the head of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> domestic factions; and instead of mild influence and voluntary obedience, she held in chains a captive and an enemy.
 The empress was overthrown by the abuse of victory; the oath of fidelity, which she exacted to herself alone, was pronounced with reluctant murmurs; and the bold refusal of the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> guards encouraged a free and general declaration, that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Sixth</ORDINAL> was the lawful emperor of the Romans.
 In this character he ascended his hereditary throne, and dismissed <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> to a life of solitude and repose.
 But her haughty spirit condescended to the arts of dissimulation: she flattered the bishops and eunuchs, revived the filial tenderness of the prince, regained his confidence, and betrayed his credulity.
 The character of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was not destitute of sense or spirit; but his education had been studiously neglected; and the ambitious mother exposed to the public censure the vices which she had nourished, and the actions which she had secretly advised: his divorce and <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> marriage offended the prejudices of the clergy, and by his imprudent rigour he forfeited the attachment of the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> guards.
 A powerful conspiracy was formed for the restoration of Irene; and the secret, though widely diffused, was faithfully kept above <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> months, till the emperor, suspicious of his danger, escaped from Constantinople, with the design of appealing to the provinces and armies.
 By this hasty flight, the empress was left on the brink of the precipice; yet before she implored the mercy of her son, <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> addressed a private epistle to the friends whom she had placed about his person, with a menace, that unless they accomplished, she would reveal, their treason.
 Their fear rendered them intrepid; they seized the emperor on the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> shore, and he was transported to the porphyry apartment of the palace, where he had <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> seen the light.
 In the mind of Irene, ambition had stifled every sentiment of humanity and nature; and it was decreed in her bloody council, that <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> should be rendered incapable of the throne: her emissaries assaulted the sleeping prince, and stabbed their daggers with such violence and precipitation into his eyes as if they meant to execute a mortal sentence.
 An ambiguous passage of <PERSON>Theophanes</PERSON> persuaded the annalist of the church that death was the immediate consequence of this barbarous execution.
 The <NORP>Catholics</NORP> have been deceived or subdued by the authority of Baronius; and <NORP>Protestant</NORP> zeal has reechoed the words of a cardinal, desirous, as it should seem, to favour the patroness of images.
 Yet the blind son of <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> survived many years, oppressed by the court and forgotten by the world; the <NORP>Isaurian</NORP> dynasty was silently extinguished; and the memory of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was recalled only by the nuptials of his daughter <PERSON>Euphrosyne</PERSON> with the emperor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the Second.
 Irene, A.
D.
 792, <DATE>August</DATE> 19.
 The most bigoted orthodoxy has justly execrated the unnatural mother, who may not easily be paralleled in the history of crimes.
 To her bloody deed superstition has attributed a subsequent darkness of seventeen days; during which many vessels in <TIME>midday</TIME> were driven from their course, as if the sun, a globe of fire so vast and so remote, could sympathize with the atoms of a revolving planet.
 On earth, the crime of <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> was left <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> years unpunished; her reign was crowned with external splendour; and if she could silence the voice of conscience, she neither heard nor regarded the reproaches of mankind.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> world bowed to the government of a female; and as she moved through the streets of Constantinople, the reins of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> milk-white steeds were held by as many patricians, who marched on foot before the golden chariot of their queen.
 But these patricians were for the most part eunuchs; and their black ingratitude justified, on this occasion, the popular hatred and contempt.
 Raised, enriched, entrusted with the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> dignities of the empire, they basely conspired against their benefactress; the great treasurer <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> was secretly invested with the purple; her successor was introduced into the palace, and crowned at St.
 Sophia by the venal patriarch.
 In their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> interview, she recapitulated with dignity the revolutions of her life, gently accused the perfidy of Nicephorus, insinuated that he owed his life to her unsuspicious clemency, and for the throne and treasures which she resigned, solicited a decent and honourable retreat.
 His avarice refused this modest compensation; and, in her exile of the Isle of Lesbos, the empress earned a scanty subsistence by the labours of her distaff.
 <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> I, A.
D.
 802, <DATE>October</DATE> 31.
 Many tyrants have reigned undoubtedly more criminal than Nicephorus, but none perhaps have more deeply incurred the universal abhorrence of their people.
 His character was stained with the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> odious vices of hypocrisy, ingratitude, and avarice: his want of virtue was not redeemed by any superior talents, nor his want of talents by any pleasing qualifications.
 Unskilful and unfortunate in war, <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> was vanquished by the Saracens, and slain by the Bulgarians; and the advantage of his death overbalanced, in the public opinion, the destruction of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> army.
 Stauracius, A.
D.
 811, July 25.
 is son and heir <PERSON>Stauracius</PERSON> escaped from the field with a mortal wound; yet <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months of an expiring life were sufficient to refute his indecent, though popular declaration, that he would in all things avoid the example of his father.
 On the near prospect of his decease, Michael, the great master of the palace, and the husband of his sister Procopia, was named by every person of the palace and city, except by his envious brother.
 Tenacious of a sceptre now falling from his hand, he conspired against the life of his successor, and cherished the idea of changing to a democracy the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 But these rash projects served only to inflame the zeal of the people and to remove the scruples of the candidate: <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> accepted the purple, and before he sunk into the grave the son of <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> implored the clemency of his new sovereign.
 <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> I.
 Rhangabe, A.
D.
 811, <DATE>October</DATE> 2.
 Had <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> in an age of peace ascended an hereditary throne, he might have reigned and died the father of his people: but his mild virtues were adapted to the shade of private life, nor was he capable of controlling the ambition of his equals, or of resisting the arms of the victorious Bulgarians.
 While his want of ability and success exposed him to the contempt of the soldiers, the masculine spirit of his wife <PERSON>Procopia</PERSON> awakened their indignation.
 Even the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> of the ninth century were provoked by the insolence of a female, who, in the front of the standards, presumed to direct their discipline and animate their valour; and their licentious clamours advised the new <NORP>Semiramis</NORP> to reverence the majesty of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> camp.
 After an unsuccessful campaign, the emperor left, in their <DATE>winter-quarters</DATE> of Thrace, a disaffected army under the command of his enemies; and their artful eloquence persuaded the soldiers to break the dominion of the eunuchs, to degrade the husband of Procopia, and to assert the right of a military election.
 They marched towards the capital: yet the clergy, the senate, and the people of Constantinople, adhered to the cause of Michael; and the troops and treasures of <LOC>Asia</LOC> might have protracted the mischiefs of civil war.
 But his humanity (by the ambitious it will be termed his weakness) protested that not a drop of <NORP>Christian</NORP> blood should be shed in his quarrel, and his messengers presented the conquerors with the keys of the city and the palace.
 They were disarmed by his innocence and submission; his life and his eyes were spared; and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> monk enjoyed the comforts of solitude and religion above thirty-two years after he had been stripped of the purple and separated from his wife.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> V.
, the Armenian, A.
D.
 813, July 11.
 A rebel, in the time of Nicephorus, the famous and unfortunate Bardanes, had once the curiosity to consult an <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> prophet, who, after prognosticating his fall, announced the fortunes of his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> principal officers, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Armenian, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the Phrygian, and <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> the Cappadocian, the successive reigns of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former, the fruitless and fatal enterprise of the third.
 This prediction was verified, or rather was produced, by the event.
 Ten years afterwards, when the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> camp rejected the husband of Procopia, the crown was presented to the same Leo, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> in military rank and the secret author of the mutiny.
 As he affected to hesitate,The compliance of the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> was rewarded with the empire, and he reigned <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years and a half under the name of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Fifth.
 Educated in a camp, and ignorant both of laws and letters, he introduced into his civil government the rigour and even cruelty of military discipline; but if his severity was sometimes dangerous to the innocent, it was always formidable to the guilty.
 His religious inconstancy was taxed by the epithet of Chameleon, but the <NORP>Catholics</NORP> have acknowledged by the voice of a saint and confessors, that the life of the <NORP>Iconoclast</NORP> was useful to the republic.
 The zeal of his companion <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was repaid with riches, honours, and military command; and his subordinate talents were beneficially employed in the public service.
 Yet the <PERSON>Phrygian</PERSON> was dissatisfied at receiving as a favour a scanty portion of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> prize which he had bestowed on his equal; and his discontent, which sometimes evaporated in hasty discourse, at length assumed a more threatening and hostile aspect against a prince whom he represented as a cruel tyrant.
 That tyrant, however, repeatedly detected, warned, and dismissed the old companion of his arms, till fear and resentment prevailed over gratitude; and Michael, after a scrutiny into his actions and designs, was convicted of treason, and sentenced to be burnt alive in the furnace of the private baths.
 The devout humanity of the empress <PERSON>Theophano</PERSON> was fatal to her husband and family.
 A solemn day, the twenty-fifth of December, had been fixed for the execution: she urged, that the anniversary of the Savior's birth would be profaned by this inhuman spectacle, and <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> consented with reluctance to a decent respite.
 But on the vigil of the feast his sleepless anxiety prompted him to visit at the dead of night the chamber in which his enemy was confined: he beheld him released from his chain, and stretched on his jailer's bed in a profound slumber.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> was alarmed at these signs of security and intelligence; but though he retired with silent steps, his entrance and departure were noticed by a slave who lay concealed in a corner of the prison.
 Under the pretence of requesting the spiritual aid of a confessor, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> informed the conspirators, that their lives depended on his discretion, and that a few hours were left to assure their own safety, by the deliverance of their friend and country.
 On the great festivals, a chosen band of priests and chanters was admitted into the palace by a private gate to sing matins in the chapel; and Leo, who regulated with the same strictness the discipline of the choir and of the camp, was seldom absent from these early devotions.
 In the ecclesiastical habit, but with their swords under their robes, the conspirators mingled with the procession, lurked in the angles of the chapel, and expected, as the signal of murder, the intonation of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> psalm by the emperor himself.
 The imperfect light, and the uniformity of dress, might have favoured his escape, whilst their assault was pointed against a harmless priest; but they soon discovered their mistake, and encompassed on all sides the royal victim.
 Without a weapon and without a friend, he grasped a weighty cross, and stood at bay against the hunters of his life; but as he asked for mercy, "This is the hour, not of mercy, but of vengeance," was the inexorable reply.
 The stroke of a well-aimed sword separated from his body the right arm and the cross, and <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> was slain at the foot of the altar.
 <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> II.
 The stammerer, A.
D.
 820, Dec.
 25.
 A memorable reverse of fortune was displayed in <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the Second, who from a defect in his speech was surnamed the Stammerer.
 He was snatched from the fiery furnace to the sovereignty of an empire; and as in the tumult a smith could not readily be found, the fetters remained on his legs several hours after he was seated on the throne of the Caesars.
 The royal blood which had been the price of his elevation, was unprofitably spent: in the purple he retained the ignoble vices of his origin; and <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> lost his provinces with as supine indifference as if they had been the inheritance of his fathers.
 His title was disputed by Thomas, the last of the military triumvirate, who transported into <LOC>Europe</LOC> fourscore <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> from the banks of the <LOC>Tigris</LOC> and the shores of the Caspian.
 He formed the siege of Constantinople; but the capital was defended with spiritual and carnal weapons; a <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> king assaulted the camp of the Orientals, and <PERSON>Thomas</PERSON> had the misfortune, or the weakness, to fall alive into the power of the conqueror.
 The hands and feet of the rebel were amputated; he was placed on an ass, and, amidst the insults of the people, was led through the streets, which he sprinkled with his blood.
 The depravation of manners, as savage as they were corrupt, is marked by the presence of the emperor himself.
 Deaf to the lamentation of a fellow-soldier, he incessantly pressed the discovery of more accomplices, till his curiosity was checked by the question of an honest or guilty minister: After the death of his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife, the emperor, at the request of the senate, drew from her monastery Euphrosyne, the daughter of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the Sixth.
 Her <DATE>august</DATE> birth might justify a stipulation in the marriage-contract, that her children should equally share the empire with their elder brother.
 But the nuptials of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> and <PERSON>Euphrosyne</PERSON> were barren; and she was content with the title of mother of Theophilus, his son and successor.
 Theophilus, A.
D.
 829, <DATE>October</DATE> 3.
 The character of <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> is a rare example in which religious zeal has allowed, and perhaps magnified, the virtues of a heretic and a persecutor.
 His valour was often felt by the enemies, and his justice by the subjects, of the monarchy; but the valour of <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> was rash and fruitless, and his justice arbitrary and cruel.
 He displayed the banner of the cross against the Saracens; but his <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> expeditions were concluded by a signal overthrow: Amorium, the native city of his ancestors, was levelled with the ground and from his military toils he derived only the surname of the Unfortunate.
 The wisdom of a sovereign is comprised in the institution of laws and the choice of magistrates, and while he seems without action, his civil government revolves round his centre with the silence and order of the planetary system.
 But the justice of <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> was fashioned on the model of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> despots, who, in personal and irregular acts of authority, consult the reason or passion of the moment, without measuring the sentence by the law, or the penalty by the offense.
 A poor woman threw herself at the emperor's feet to complain of a powerful neighbour, the brother of the empress, who had raised his palace-wall to such an inconvenient height, that her humble dwelling was excluded from light and air! On the proof of the fact, instead of granting, like an ordinary judge, sufficient or ample damages to the plaintiff, the sovereign adjudged to her use and benefit the palace and the ground.
 Nor was <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> content with this extravagant satisfaction: his zeal converted a civil trespass into a criminal act; and the unfortunate patrician was stripped and scourged in the public place of Constantinople.
 For some venial offenses, some defect of equity or vigilance, the principal ministers, a praefect, a quaestor, a captain of the guards, were banished or mutilated, or scalded with boiling pitch, or burnt alive in the hippodrome; and as these dreadful examples might be the effects of error or caprice, they must have alienated from his service the best and wisest of the citizens.
 But the pride of the monarch was flattered in the exercise of power, or, as he thought, of virtue; and the people, safe in their obscurity, applauded the danger and debasement of their superiors.
 This extraordinary rigour was justified, in some measure, by its salutary consequences; since, after a scrutiny of seventeen days, not a complaint or abuse could be found in the court or city; and it might be alleged that the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> could be ruled only with a rod of iron, and that the public interest is the motive and law of the supreme judge.
 Yet in the crime, or the suspicion, of treason, that judge is of all others the most credulous and partial.
 <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> might inflict a tardy vengeance on the assassins of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> and the saviours of his father; but he enjoyed the fruits of their crime; and his jealous tyranny sacrificed a brother and a prince to the future safety of his life.
 A <NORP>Persian</NORP> of the race of the <PERSON>Sassanides</PERSON> died in poverty and exile at Constantinople, leaving an only son, the issue of a plebeian marriage.
 At the age of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years, the royal birth of <PERSON>Theophobus</PERSON> was revealed, and his merit was not unworthy of his birth.
 He was educated in the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace, a <NORP>Christian</NORP> and a soldier; advanced with rapid steps in the career of fortune and glory; received the hand of the emperor's sister; and was promoted to the command of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> Persians, who, like his father, had fled from the <NORP>Mahometan</NORP> conquerors.
 These troops, doubly infected with mercenary and fanatic vices, were desirous of revolting against their benefactor, and erecting the standard of their native king but the loyal <PERSON>Theophobus</PERSON> rejected their offers, disconcerted their schemes, and escaped from their hands to the camp or palace of his royal brother.
 A generous confidence might have secured a faithful and able guardian for his wife and his infant son, to whom Theophilus, in the flower of his age, was compelled to leave the inheritance of the empire.
 But his jealousy was exasperated by envy and disease; he feared the dangerous virtues which might either support or oppress their infancy and weakness; and the dying emperor demanded the head of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> prince.
 With savage delight he recognized the familiar features of his brother:Michael III.
, A.
D.
 842, <DATE>January</DATE> 20.
 The Russians, who have borrowed from the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> the greatest part of their civil and ecclesiastical policy, preserved, till the last century, a singular institution in the marriage of the Czar.
 They collected, not the virgins of every rank and of every province, a vain and romantic idea, but the daughters of the principal nobles, who awaited in the palace the choice of their sovereign.
 It is affirmed, that a similar method was adopted in the nuptials of Theophilus.
 With a golden apple in his hand, he slowly walked between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> lines of contending beauties: his eye was detained by the charms of Icasia, and in the awkwardness of a <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> declaration, the prince could only observe, that, in this world, women had been the cause of much evil;This affectation of unseasonable wit displeased the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> lover: he turned aside in disgust; <PERSON>Icasia</PERSON> concealed her mortification in a convent; and the modest silence of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> was rewarded with the golden apple.
 She deserved the love, but did not escape the severity, of her lord.
 From the palace garden he beheld a vessel deeply laden, and steering into the port: on the discovery that the precious cargo of <NORP>Syrian</NORP> luxury was the property of his wife, he condemned the ship to the flames, with a sharp reproach, that her avarice had degraded the character of an empress into that of a merchant.
 Yet his last choice entrusted her with the guardianship of the empire and her son Michael, who was left an orphan in the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> year of his age.
 The restoration of images, and the final extirpation of the Iconoclasts, has endeared her name to the devotion of the Greeks; but in the fervour of religious zeal, <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> entertained a grateful regard for the memory and salvation of her husband.
 After thirteen years of a prudent and frugal administration, she perceived the decline of her influence; but the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> imitated only the virtues of her predecessor.
 Instead of conspiring against the life or government of her son, she retired, without a struggle, though not without a murmur, to the solitude of private life, deploring the ingratitude, the vices, and the inevitable ruin, of the worthless youth.
 Among the successors of <PERSON>Nero</PERSON> and Elagabalus, we have not hitherto found the imitation of their vices, the character of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> prince who considered pleasure as the object of life, and virtue as the enemy of pleasure.
 Whatever might have been the maternal care of <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> in the education of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the Third, her unfortunate son was a king before he was a man.
 If the ambitious mother labored to check the progress of reason, she could not cool the ebullition of passion; and her selfish policy was justly repaid by the contempt and ingratitude of the headstrong youth.
 At the age of eighteen, he rejected her authority, without feeling his own incapacity to govern the empire and himself.
 With Theodora, all gravity and wisdom retired from the court; their place was supplied by the alternate dominion of vice and folly; and it was impossible, without forfeiting the public esteem, to acquire or preserve the favour of the emperor.
 The <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> of gold and silver which had been accumulated for the service of the state, were lavished on the vilest of men, who flattered his passions and shared his pleasures; and in a reign of thirteen years, the richest of sovereigns was compelled to strip the palace and the churches of their precious furniture.
 Like Nero, he delighted in the amusements of the theatre, and sighed to be surpassed in the accomplishments in which he should have blushed to excel.
 Yet the studies of <PERSON>Nero</PERSON> in music and poetry betrayed some symptoms of a liberal taste; the more ignoble arts of the son of <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> were confined to the chariot-race of the hippodrome.
 The <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> factions which had agitated the peace, still amused the idleness, of the capital: for himself, the emperor assumed the blue livery; the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rival colours were distributed to his favourites, and in the vile though eager contention he forgot the dignity of his person and the safety of his dominions.
 He silenced the messenger of an invasion, who presumed to divert his attention in the most critical moment of the race; and by his command, the importunate beacons were extinguished, that too frequently spread the alarm from <GPE>Tarsus</GPE> to Constantinople.
 The most skilful charioteers obtained the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> place in his confidence and esteem; their merit was profusely rewarded the emperor feasted in their houses, and presented their children at the baptismal font; and while he applauded his own popularity, he affected to blame the cold and stately reserve of his predecessors.
 The unnatural lusts which had degraded even the manhood of Nero, were banished from the world; yet the strength of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was consumed by the indulgence of love and intemperance.
 In his <TIME>midnight</TIME> revels, when his passions were inflamed by wine, he was provoked to issue the most sanguinary commands; and if any feelings of humanity were left, he was reduced, with the return of sense, to approve the salutary disobedience of his servants.
 But the most extraordinary feature in the character of Michael, is the profane mockery of the religion of his country.
 The superstition of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> might indeed excite the smile of a philosopher; but his smile would have been rational and temperate, and he must have condemned the ignorant folly of a youth who insulted the objects of public veneration.
 A buffoon of the court was invested in the robes of the patriarch: his <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> metropolitans, among whom the emperor was ranked, assumed their ecclesiastical garments: they used or abused the sacred vessels of the altar; and in their bacchanalian feasts, the holy communion was administered in a nauseous compound of vinegar and mustard.
 Nor were these impious spectacles concealed from the eyes of the city.
 On the day of a solemn festival, the emperor, with his bishops or buffoons, rode on asses through the streets, encountered the true patriarch at the head of his clergy; and by their licentious shouts and obscene gestures, disordered the gravity of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> procession.
 The devotion of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> appeared only in some offence to reason or piety: he received his theatrical crowns from the statue of the Virgin; and an <NORP>Imperial</NORP> tomb was violated for the sake of burning the bones of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the Iconoclast.
 By this extravagant conduct, the son of <PERSON>Theophilus</PERSON> became as contemptible as he was odious: every citizen was impatient for the deliverance of his country; and even the favourites of the moment were apprehensive that a caprice might snatch away what a caprice had bestowed.
 In the thirtieth year of his age, and in the hour of intoxication and sleep, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Third</ORDINAL> was murdered in his chamber by the founder of a new dynasty, whom the emperor had raised to an equality of rank and power.
 <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> I.
 the Macedonian, A.
D.
 867 Sept.
 24.
 The genealogy of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> (if it be not the spurious offspring of pride and flattery) exhibits a genuine picture of the revolution of the most illustrious families.
 The Arsacides, the rivals of Rome, possessed the sceptre of the <LOC>East</LOC> near <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years: a younger branch of these <NORP>Parthian</NORP> kings continued to reign in Armenia; and their royal descendants survived the partition and servitude of that ancient monarchy.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> of these, <NORP>Artabanus</NORP> and Chlienes, escaped or retired to the court of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the First: his bounty seated them in a safe and hospitable exile, in the province of Macedonia: <ORG>Adrianople</ORG> was their final settlement.
 During several generations they maintained the dignity of their birth; and their <NORP>Roman</NORP> patriotism rejected the tempting offers of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> and <NORP>Arabian</NORP> powers, who recalled them to their native country.
 But their splendour was insensibly clouded by time and poverty; and the father of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> was reduced to a small farm, which he cultivated with his own hands: yet he scorned to disgrace the blood of the <NORP>Arsacides</NORP> by a plebeian alliance: his wife, a widow of Adrianople, was pleased to count among her ancestors the great Constantine; and their royal infant was connected by some dark affinity of lineage or country with the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> Alexander.
 No sooner was he born, than the cradle of Basil, his family, and his city, were swept away by an inundation of the Bulgarians: he was educated a slave in a foreign land; and in this severe discipline, he acquired the hardiness of body and flexibility of mind which promoted his future elevation.
 In the age of youth or manhood he shared the deliverance of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> captives, who generously broke their fetters, marched through <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> to the shores of the Euxine, defeated <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies of Barbarians, embarked in the ships which had been stationed for their reception, and returned to Constantinople, from whence they were distributed to their respective homes.
 But the freedom of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> was naked and destitute: his farm was ruined by the calamities of war: after his father's death, his manual labor, or service, could no longer support a family of orphans and he resolved to seek a more conspicuous theatre, in which every virtue and every vice may lead to the paths of greatness.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> night of his arrival at Constantinople, without friends or money, the weary pilgrim slept on the steps of the church of St.
 Diomede: he was fed by the casual hospitality of a monk; and was introduced to the service of a cousin and namesake of the emperor Theophilus; who, though himself of a diminutive person, was always followed by a train of tall and handsome domestics.
 <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> attended his patron to the government of Peloponnesus; eclipsed, by his personal merit the birth and dignity of Theophilus, and formed a useful connection with a wealthy and charitable matron of Patras.
 Her spiritual or carnal love embraced the young adventurer, whom she adopted as her son.
 <PERSON>Danielis</PERSON> presented him with <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> slaves; and the produce of her bounty was expended in the support of his brothers, and the purchase of some large estates in Macedonia.
 His gratitude or ambition still attached him to the service of Theophilus; and a lucky accident recommended him to the notice of the court.
 A famous wrestler, in the train of the <NORP>Bulgarian</NORP> ambassadors, had defied, at the royal banquet, the boldest and most robust of the Greeks.
 The strength of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> was praised; he accepted the challenge; and the <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> champion was overthrown at the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> onset.
 A beautiful but vicious horse was condemned to be hamstrung: it was subdued by the dexterity and courage of the servant of Theophilus; and his conqueror was promoted to an honourable rank in the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> stables.
 But it was impossible to obtain the confidence of Michael, without complying with his vices; and his new favourite, the great chamberlain of the palace, was raised and supported by a disgraceful marriage with a royal concubine, and the dishonour of his sister, who succeeded to her place.
 The public administration had been abandoned to the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> Bardas, the brother and enemy of Theodora; but the arts of female influence persuaded <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> to hate and to fear his uncle: he was drawn from Constantinople, under the pretence of a <NORP>Cretan</NORP> expedition, and stabbed in the tent of audience, by the sword of the chamberlain, and in the presence of the emperor.
 About a month after this execution, <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> was invested with the title of <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and the government of the empire.
 He supported this unequal association till his influence was fortified by popular esteem.
 His life was endangered by the caprice of the emperor; and his dignity was profaned by a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> colleague, who had rowed in the galleys.
 Yet the murder of his benefactor must be condemned as an act of ingratitude and treason; and the churches which he dedicated to the name of St.
 <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> were a poor and puerile expiation of his guilt.
 The different ages of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> may be compared with those of Augustus.
 The situation of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> did not allow him in his earliest youth to lead an army against his country; or to proscribe the nobles of her sons; but his aspiring genius stooped to the arts of a slave; he dissembled his ambition and even his virtues, and grasped, with the bloody hand of an assassin, the empire which he ruled with the wisdom and tenderness of a parent.
 A private citizen may feel his interest repugnant to his duty; but it must be from a deficiency of sense or courage, that an absolute monarch can separate his happiness from his glory, or his glory from the public welfare.
 The life or panegyric of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> has indeed been composed and published under the long reign of his descendants; but even their stability on the throne may be justly ascribed to the superior merit of their ancestor.
 In his character, his grandson <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> has attempted to delineate a perfect image of royalty: but that feeble prince, unless he had copied a real model, could not easily have soared so high above the level of his own conduct or conceptions.
 But the most solid praise of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> is drawn from the comparison of a ruined and a flourishing monarchy, that which he wrested from the dissolute Michael, and that which he bequeathed to the <NORP>Mecedonian</NORP> dynasty.
 The evils which had been sanctified by time and example, were corrected by his master-hand; and he revived, if not the national spirit, at least the order and majesty of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 His application was indefatigable, his temper cool, his understanding vigorous and decisive; and in his practice he observed that rare and salutary moderation, which pursues each virtue, at an equal distance between the opposite vices.
 His military service had been confined to the palace: nor was the emperor endowed with the spirit or the talents of a warrior.
 Yet under his reign the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms were again formidable to the Barbarians.
 As soon as he had formed a new army by discipline and exercise, he appeared in person on the banks of the Euphrates, curbed the pride of the Saracens, and suppressed the dangerous though just revolt of the Manichaeans.
 His indignation against a rebel who had long eluded his pursuit, provoked him to wish and to pray, that, by the grace of God, he might drive <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> arrows into the head of Chrysochir.
 That odious head, which had been obtained by treason rather than by valour, was suspended from a tree, and thrice exposed to the dexterity of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> archer; a base revenge against the dead, more worthy of the times than of the character of Basil.
 But his principal merit was in the civil administration of the finances and of the laws.
 To replenish and exhausted treasury, it was proposed to resume the lavish and ill-placed gifts of his predecessor: his prudence abated <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> moiety of the restitution; and a sum of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> pounds was instantly procured to answer the most pressing demands, and to allow some space for the mature operations of economy.
 Among the various schemes for the improvement of the revenue, a new mode was suggested of capitation, or tribute, which would have too much depended on the arbitrary discretion of the assessors.
 A sufficient list of honest and able agents was instantly produced by the minister; but on the more careful scrutiny of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> himself, only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> could be found, who might be safely entrusted with such dangerous powers; but they justified his esteem by declining his confidence.
 But the serious and successful diligence of the emperor established by degrees the equitable balance of property and payment, of receipt and expenditure; a peculiar fund was appropriated to each service; and a public method secured the interest of the prince and the property of the people.
 After reforming the luxury, he assigned <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> patrimonial estates to supply the decent plenty, of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> table: the contributions of the subject were reserved for his defence; and the residue was employed in the embellishment of the capital and provinces.
 A taste for building, however costly, may deserve some praise and much excuse: from thence industry is fed, art is encouraged, and some object is attained of public emolument or pleasure: the use of a road, an aqueduct, or a hospital, is obvious and solid; and the <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> churches that arose by the command of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> were consecrated to the devotion of the age.
 In the character of a judge he was assiduous and impartial; desirous to save, but not afraid to strike: the oppressors of the people were severely chastised; but his personal foes, whom it might be unsafe to pardon, were condemned, after the loss of their eyes, to a life of solitude and repentance.
 The change of language and manners demanded a revision of the obsolete jurisprudence of Justinian: the voluminous body of his Institutes, Pandects, Code, and Novels, was digested under <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> titles, in the <NORP>Greek</NORP> idiom; and the Basilics, which were improved and completed by his son and grandson, must be referred to the original genius of the founder of their race.
 This glorious reign was terminated by an accident in the chase.
 A furious stag entangled his horns in the belt of Basil, and raised him from his horse: he was rescued by an attendant, who cut the belt and slew the animal; but the fall, or the fever, exhausted the strength of the aged monarch, and he expired in the palace amidst the tears of his family and people.
 If he struck off the head of the faithful servant for presuming to draw his sword against his sovereign, the pride of despotism, which had lain dormant in his life, revived in the last moments of despair, when he no longer wanted or valued the opinion of mankind.
 <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> VI.
 The Philosopher, A.
D.
 886, March 1.
 Of the <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> sons of the emperor, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> died before his father, whose grief and credulity were amused by a flattering impostor and a vain apparition.
 Stephen, the youngest, was content with the honours of a patriarch and a saint; both <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> were alike invested with the purple, but the powers of government were solely exercised by the elder brother.
 The name of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Sixth</ORDINAL> has been dignified with the title of philosopher; and the union of the prince and the sage, of the active and speculative virtues, would indeed constitute the perfection of human nature.
 But the claims of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> are far short of this ideal excellence.
 Did he reduce his passions and appetites under the dominion of reason? His life was spent in the pomp of the palace, in the society of his wives and concubines; and even the clemency which he showed, and the peace which he strove to preserve, must be imputed to the softness and indolence of his character.
 Did he subdue his prejudices, and those of his subjects? His mind was tinged with the most puerile superstition; the influence of the clergy, and the errors of the people, were consecrated by his laws; and the oracles of Leo, which reveal, in prophetic style, the fates of the empire, are founded on the arts of astrology and divination.
 If we still inquire the reason of his sage appellation, it can only be replied, that the son of <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> was less ignorant than the greater part of his contemporaries in church and state; that his education had been directed by the learned Photius; and that several books of profane and ecclesiastical science were composed by the pen, or in the name, of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> philosopher.
 But the reputation of his philosophy and religion was overthrown by a domestic vice, the repetition of his nuptials.
 The primitive ideas of the merit and holiness of celibacy were preached by the monks and entertained by the Greeks.
 Marriage was allowed as a necessary means for the propagation of mankind; after the death of either party, the survivor might satisfy, by a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> union, the weakness or the strength of the flesh: but a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> marriage was censured as a state of legal fornication; and a <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> was a sin or scandal as yet unknown to the <NORP>Christians</NORP> of the East.
 In the beginning of his reign, <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> himself had abolished the state of concubines, and condemned, without annulling, <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> marriages: but his patriotism and love soon compelled him to violate his own laws, and to incur the penance, which in a similar case he had imposed on his subjects.
 In his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> alliances, his nuptial bed was unfruitful; the emperor required a female companion, and the empire a legitimate heir.
 The beautiful <PERSON>Zoe</PERSON> was introduced into the palace as a concubine; and after a trial of her fecundity, and the birth of Constantine, her lover declared his intention of legitimating the mother and the child, by the celebration of his <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> nuptials.
 But the patriarch <PERSON>Nicholas</PERSON> refused his blessing: the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> baptism of the young prince was obtained by a promise of separation; and the contumacious husband of <PERSON>Zoe</PERSON> was excluded from the communion of the faithful.
 Neither the fear of exile, nor the desertion of his brethren, nor the authority of the <NORP>Latin</NORP> church, nor the danger of failure or doubt in the succession to the empire, could bend the spirit of the inflexible monk.
 After the death of Leo, he was recalled from exile to the civil and ecclesiastical administration; and the edict of union which was promulgated in the name of Constantine, condemned the future scandal of <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> marriages, and left a tacit imputation on his own birth.
 Alexander, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> VII.
 Porphyrogenitus, A.
D.
 911, <DATE>May</DATE> 11.
 In the <NORP>Greek</NORP> language, purple and porphyry are the same word: and as the colours of nature are invariable, we may learn, that a dark deep red was the <NORP>Tyrian</NORP> dye which stained the purple of the ancients.
 An apartment of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> palace was lined with porphyry: it was reserved for the use of the pregnant empresses; and the royal birth of their children was expressed by the appellation of porphyrogenite, or born in the purple.
 Several of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes had been blessed with an heir; but this peculiar surname was <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> applied to <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the Seventh.
 His life and titular reign were of equal duration; but of fifty-four years, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> had elapsed before his father's death; and the son of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> was ever the voluntary or reluctant subject of those who oppressed his weakness or abused his confidence.
 His uncle Alexander, who had long been invested with the title of Augustus, was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> colleague and governor of the young prince: but in a rapid career of vice and folly, the brother of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> already emulated the reputation of Michael; and when he was extinguished by a timely death, he entertained a project of castrating his nephew, and leaving the empire to a worthless favourite.
 The succeeding years of the minority of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were occupied by his mother Zoe, and a succession or council of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> regents, who pursued their interest, gratified their passions, abandoned the republic, supplanted each other, and finally vanished in the presence of a soldier.
 From an obscure origin, <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> <PERSON>Lecapenus</PERSON> had raised himself to the command of the naval armies; and in the anarchy of the times, had deserved, or at least had obtained, the national esteem.
 With a victorious and affectionate fleet, he sailed from the mouth of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> into the harbor of Constantinople, and was hailed as the deliverer of the people, and the guardian of the prince.
 His supreme office was at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> defined by the new appellation of father of the emperor; <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> I.
 Lecapenus, A.

 but <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> soon disdained the subordinate powers of a minister, and assumed with the titles of <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> and Augustus, the full independence of royalty, which he held near five-and-twenty years.
 Christopher, Stephen, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> VIII.
 His <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons, Christopher, Stephen, and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> were successively adorned with the same honours, and the lawful emperor was degraded from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> rank in this college of princes.
 Yet, in the preservation of his life and crown, he might still applaud his own fortune and the clemency of the usurper.
 The examples of ancient and modern history would have excused the ambition of Romanus: the powers and the laws of the empire were in his hand; the spurious birth of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> would have justified his exclusion; and the grave or the monastery was open to receive the son of the concubine.
 But <PERSON>Lecapenus</PERSON> does not appear to have possessed either the virtues or the vices of a tyrant.
 The spirit and activity of his private life dissolved away in the sunshine of the throne; and in his licentious pleasures, he forgot the safety both of the republic and of his family.
 Of a mild and religious character, he respected the sanctity of oaths, the innocence of the youth, the memory of his parents, and the attachment of the people.
 The studious temper and retirement of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> disarmed the jealousy of power: his books and music, his pen and his pencil, were a constant source of amusement; and if he could improve a scanty allowance by the sale of his pictures, if their price was not enhanced by the name of the artist, he was endowed with a personal talent, which few princes could employ in the hour of adversity.

 The fall of <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> was occasioned by his own vices and those of his children.
 After the decease of Christopher, his eldest son, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> surviving brothers quarrelled with each other, and conspired against their father.
 At the hour of noon, when all strangers were regularly excluded from the palace, they entered his apartment with an armed force, and conveyed him, in the habit of a monk, to a small island in the Propontis, which was peopled by a religious community.
 The rumour of this domestic revolution excited a tumult in the city; but <PERSON>Porphyrogenitus</PERSON> alone, the true and lawful emperor, was the object of the public care; and the sons of <PERSON>Lecapenus</PERSON> were taught, by tardy experience, that they had achieved a guilty and perilous enterprise for the benefit of their rival.
 Their sister Helena, the wife of Constantine, revealed, or supposed, their treacherous design of assassinating her husband at the royal banquet.
 His loyal adherents were alarmed, and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> usurpers were prevented, seized, degraded from the purple, and embarked for the same island and monastery where their father had been so lately confined.
 Old <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> met them on the beach with a sarcastic smile, and, after a just reproach of their folly and ingratitude, presented his <NORP>Imperial</NORP> colleagues with an equal share of his water and vegetable diet.
 In the fortieth year of his reign, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the <DATE>Seventh</DATE> obtained the possession of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> world, which he ruled or seemed to rule, near fifteen years.
 But he was devoid of that energy of character which could emerge into a life of action and glory; and the studies, which had amused and dignified his leisure, were incompatible with the serious duties of a sovereign.
 The emperor neglected the practice to instruct his son <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> in the theory of government; while he indulged the habits of intemperance and sloth, he dropped the reins of the administration into the hands of <PERSON>Helena</PERSON> his wife; and, in the shifting scene of her favour and caprice, each minister was regretted in the promotion of a more worthless successor.
 Yet the birth and misfortunes of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> had endeared him to the Greeks; they excused his failings; they respected his learning, his innocence, and charity, his love of justice; and the ceremony of his funeral was mourned with the unfeigned tears of his subjects.
 The body, according to ancient custom, lay in state in the vestibule of the palace; and the civil and military officers, the patricians, the senate, and the clergy approached in due order to adore and kiss the inanimate corpse of their sovereign.
 Before the procession moved towards the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> sepulchre, a herald proclaimed this awful admonition:Romanus II.
 Junior, A.
D.
 959, Nov.
 15.
 The death of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was imputed to poison; and his son Romanus, who derived that name from his maternal grandfather, ascended the throne of Constantinople.
 A prince who, at the age of twenty, could be suspected of anticipating his inheritance, must have been already lost in the public esteem; yet <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> was rather weak than wicked; and the largest share of the guilt was transferred to his wife, Theophano, a woman of base origin masculine spirit, and flagitious manners.
 The sense of personal glory and public happiness, the true pleasures of royalty, were unknown to the son of Constantine; and, while the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers, <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> and Leo, triumphed over the Saracens, the hours which the emperor owed to his people were consumed in strenuous idleness.
 In the morning he visited the circus; at <TIME>noon</TIME> he feasted the senators; the greater part of the afternoon he spent in the sphoeristerium, or tennis-court, the only theatre of his victories; from thence he passed over to the <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> side of the Bosphorus, hunted and killed <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> wild boars of the largest size, and returned to the palace, proudly content with the labours of the day.
 In strength and beauty he was conspicuous above his equals: tall and straight as a young cypress, his complexion was fair and florid, his eyes sparkling, his shoulders broad, his nose long and aquiline.
 Yet even these perfections were insufficient to fix the love of Theophano; and, after a reign of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, she mingled for her husband the same deadly draught which she had composed for his father.
 <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> II.
 Phocas, A.
D.
 963, <DATE>August</DATE> 6.
 By his marriage with this impious woman, <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> the younger left <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the Ninth, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> daughters, <PERSON>Theophano</PERSON> and Anne.
 The eldest sister was given to <PERSON>Otho</PERSON> the Second, emperor of the West; the younger became the wife of Wolodomir, great duke and apostle of Russia, and by the marriage of her granddaughter with <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> the First, king of France, the blood of the Macedonians, and perhaps of the Arsacides, still flows in the veins of the <ORG>Bourbon</ORG> line.
 After the death of her husband, the empress aspired to reign in the name of her sons, the elder of whom was five, and the younger only two, years of age; but she soon felt the instability of a throne which was supported by a female who could not be esteemed, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> infants who could not be feared.
 <PERSON>Theophano</PERSON> looked around for a protector, and threw herself into the arms of the bravest soldier; her heart was capacious; but the deformity of the new favourite rendered it more than probable that interest was the motive and excuse of her love.
 <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> Phocus united, in the popular opinion, the double merit of a hero and a saint.
 In the former character, his qualifications were genuine and splendid: the descendant of a race illustrious by their military exploits, he had displayed in every station and in every province the courage of a soldier and the conduct of a chief; and <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> was crowned with recent laurels, from the important conquest of the Isle of Crete.
 His religion was of a more ambiguous cast; and his hair-cloth, his fasts, his pious idiom, and his wish to retire from the business of the world, were a convenient mask for his dark and dangerous ambition.
 Yet he imposed on a holy patriarch, by whose influence, and by a decree of the senate, he was entrusted, during the minority of the young princes, with the absolute and independent command of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> armies.
 As soon as he had secured the leaders and the troops, he boldly marched to Constantinople, trampled on his enemies, avowed his correspondence with the empress, and without degrading her sons, assumed, with the title of Augustus, the preeminence of rank and the plenitude of power.
 But his marriage with <PERSON>Theophano</PERSON> was refused by the same patriarch who had placed the crown on his head: by his <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> nuptials he incurred a year of canonical penance; a bar of spiritual affinity was opposed to their celebration; and some evasion and perjury were required to silence the scruples of the clergy and people.
 The popularity of the emperor was lost in the purple: in a reign of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years he provoked the hatred of strangers and subjects: and the hypocrisy and avarice of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> were revived in his successor.
 Hypocrisy I shall never justify or palliate; but I will dare to observe, that the odious vice of avarice is of all others most hastily arraigned, and most unmercifully condemned.
 In a private citizen, our judgment seldom expects an accurate scrutiny into his fortune and expense; and in a steward of the public treasure, frugality is always a virtue, and the increase of taxes too often an indispensable duty.
 In the use of his patrimony, the generous temper of <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> had been proved; and the revenue was strictly applied to the service of the state: each spring the emperor marched in person against the Saracens; and every <NORP>Roman</NORP> might compute the employment of his taxes in triumphs, conquests, and the security of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> barrier.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> Zimisces, <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> II.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> IX, A.
D.
 969, Dec.
 25.
 Among the warriors who promoted his elevation, and served under his standard, a noble and valiant <NORP>Armenian</NORP> had deserved and obtained the most eminent rewards.
 The stature of <PERSON>John</PERSON> <NORP>Zimisces</NORP> was below the ordinary standard: but this diminutive body was endowed with strength, beauty, and the soul of a hero.
 By the jealousy of the emperor's brother, he was degraded from the office of general of the East, to that of director of the posts, and his murmurs were chastised with disgrace and exile.
 But <NORP>Zimisces</NORP> was ranked among the numerous lovers of the empress: on her intercession, he was permitted to reside at Chalcedon, in the neighbourhood of the capital: her bounty was repaid in his clandestine and amorous visits to the palace; and <PERSON>Theophano</PERSON> consented, with alacrity, to the death of an ugly and penurious husband.
 Some bold and trusty conspirators were concealed in her most private chambers: in the darkness of a winter night, Zimisces, with his principal companions, embarked in a small boat, traversed the Bosphorus, landed at the palace stairs, and silently ascended a ladder of ropes, which was cast down by the female attendants.
 Neither his own suspicions, nor the warnings of his friends, nor the tardy aid of his brother Leo, nor the fortress which he had erected in the palace, could protect <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> from a domestic foe, at whose voice every door was open to the assassins.
 As he slept on a bear-skin on the ground, he was roused by their noisy intrusion, and <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> daggers glittered before his eyes.
 It is doubtful whether <NORP>Zimisces</NORP> imbrued his hands in the blood of his sovereign; but he enjoyed the inhuman spectacle of revenge.
 The murder was protracted by insult and cruelty: and as soon as the head of <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> was shown from the window, the tumult was hushed, and the <NORP>Armenian</NORP> was emperor of the East.
 On the day of his coronation, he was stopped on the threshold of St.
 Sophia, by the intrepid patriarch; who charged his conscience with the deed of treason and blood; and required, as a sign of repentance, that he should separate himself from his more criminal associate.
 This sally of apostolic zeal was not offensive to the prince, since he could neither love nor trust a woman who had repeatedly violated the most sacred obligations; and Theophano, instead of sharing his imperial fortune, was dismissed with ignominy from his bed and palace.
 In their last interview, she displayed a frantic and impotent rage; accused the ingratitude of her lover; assaulted, with words and blows, her son Basil, as he stood silent and submissive in the presence of a superior colleague; and avowed her own prostitution in proclaiming the illegitimacy of his birth.
 The public indignation was appeased by her exile, and the punishment of the meaner accomplices: the death of an unpopular prince was forgiven; and the guilt of <NORP>Zimisces</NORP> was forgotten in the splendour of his virtues.
 Perhaps his profusion was less useful to the state than the avarice of Nicephorus; but his gentle and generous behaviour delighted all who approached his person; and it was only in the paths of victory that he trod in the footsteps of his predecessor.
 The greatest part of his reign was employed in the camp and the field: his personal valour and activity were signalized on the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the Tigris, the ancient boundaries of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world; and by his double triumph over the <NORP>Russians</NORP> and the Saracens, he deserved the titles of saviour of the empire, and conqueror of the East.
 In his last return from Syria, he observed that the most fruitful lands of his new provinces were possessed by the eunuchs.
 The complaint was reechoed to the palace, and the death of <NORP>Zimisces</NORP> is strongly marked with the suspicion of poison.
Basil II.
 And <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> IX, A.
D.
 976, <DATE>January</DATE> 10.
 Under this usurpation, or regency, of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> lawful emperors, <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> and Constantine, had silently grown to the age of manhood.
 Their tender years had been incapable of dominion: the respectful modesty of their attendance and salutation was due to the age and merit of their guardians; the childless ambition of those guardians had no temptation to violate their right of succession: their patrimony was ably and faithfully administered; and the premature death of <NORP>Zimisces</NORP> was a loss, rather than a benefit, to the sons of Romanus.
 Their want of experience detained them <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years longer the obscure and voluntary pupils of a minister, who extended his reign by persuading them to indulge the pleasures of youth, and to disdain the labours of government.
 In this silken web, the weakness of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was forever entangled; but his elder brother felt the impulse of genius and the desire of action; he frowned, and the minister was no more.
 <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> was the acknowledged sovereign of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and the provinces of Europe; but <LOC>Asia</LOC> was oppressed by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> veteran generals, <PERSON>Phocas</PERSON> and Sclerus, who, alternately friends and enemies, subjects and rebels, maintained their independence, and labored to emulate the example of successful usurpation.
 Against these domestic enemies the son of <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> drew his sword, and they trembled in the presence of a lawful and high-spirited prince.
 The first, in the front of battle, was thrown from his horse, by the stroke of poison, or an arrow; the second, who had been twice loaded with chains, and twice invested with the purple, was desirous of ending in peace the small remainder of his days.
 As the aged suppliant approached the throne, with dim eyes and faltering steps, leaning on his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> attendants, the emperor exclaimed, in the insolence of youth and power, "And is this the man who has so long been the object of our terror?" After he had confirmed his own authority, and the peace of the empire, the trophies of <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> and <NORP>Zimisces</NORP> would not suffer their royal pupil to sleep in the palace.
 His long and frequent expeditions against the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> were rather glorious than useful to the empire; but the final destruction of the kingdom of <GPE>Bulgaria</GPE> appears, since the time of Belisarius, the most important triumph of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms.
 Yet, instead of applauding their victorious prince, his subjects detested the rapacious and rigid avarice of Basil; and in the imperfect narrative of his exploits, we can only discern the courage, patience, and ferociousness of a soldier.
 A vicious education, which could not subdue his spirit, had clouded his mind; he was ignorant of every science; and the remembrance of his learned and feeble grandsire might encourage his real or affected contempt of laws and lawyers, of artists and arts.
 Of such a character, in such an age, superstition took a firm and lasting possession; after the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> license of his youth, <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> devoted his life, in the palace and the camp, to the penance of a hermit, wore the monastic habit under his robes and armour, observed a vow of continence, and imposed on his appetites a perpetual abstinence from wine and flesh.
 In the sixty-eighth year of his age, his martial spirit urged him to embark in person for a holy war against the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> of Sicily; he was prevented by death, and Basil, surnamed the Slayer of the Bulgarians, was dismissed from the world with the blessings of the clergy and the curse of the people.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> IX.
, A.
D.
 1025, <DATE>December</DATE> After his decease, his brother <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> enjoyed, about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years, the power, or rather the pleasures, of royalty; and his only care was the settlement of the succession.
 He had enjoyed sixty-six years the title of Augustus; and the reign of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers is the longest, and most obscure, of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> history.
 <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> III.
 Argyrus, A.
D 1028, Nov.
 12.
 A lineal succession of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> emperors, in a period of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> and <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> years, had attached the loyalty of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> to the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> dynasty, which had been thrice respected by the usurpers of their power.
 After the death of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the Ninth, the last male of the royal race, a new and broken scene presents itself, and the accumulated years of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> emperors do not equal the space of his single reign.
 His elder brother had preferred his private chastity to the public interest, and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> himself had only <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> daughters; Eudocia, who took the veil, and <PERSON>Zoe</PERSON> and Theodora, who were preserved till a mature age in a state of ignorance and virginity.
 When their marriage was discussed in the council of their dying father, the cold or pious <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> refused to give an heir to the empire, but her sister <PERSON>Zoe</PERSON> presented herself a willing victim at the altar.
 <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> Argyrus, a patrician of a graceful person and fair reputation, was chosen for her husband, and, on his declining that honour, was informed, that blindness or death was the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> alternative.
 The motive of his reluctance was conjugal affection but his faithful wife sacrificed her own happiness to his safety and greatness; and her entrance into a monastery removed the only bar to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> nuptials.
 After the decease of Constantine, the sceptre devolved to <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> the Third; but his labours at home and abroad were equally feeble and fruitless; and the mature age, the forty-eight years of Zoe, were less favourable to the hopes of pregnancy than to the indulgence of pleasure.
 Her favourite chamberlain was a handsome <NORP>Paphlagonian</NORP> of the name of Michael, whose <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> trade had been that of a money-changer; and Romanus, either from gratitude or equity, connived at their criminal intercourse, or accepted a slight assurance of their innocence.
 But <PERSON>Zoe</PERSON> soon justified the <NORP>Roman</NORP> maxim, that every adulteress is capable of poisoning her husband; and the death of <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> was instantly followed by the scandalous marriage and elevation of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the Fourth.
 <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> IV the Paphlagonian, A.
D 1034, April 11.
 The expectations of <PERSON>Zoe</PERSON> were, however, disappointed: instead of a vigorous and grateful lover, she had placed in her bed a miserable wretch, whose health and reason were impaired by epileptic fits, and whose conscience was tormented by despair and remorse.
 The most skilful physicians of the mind and body were summoned to his aid; and his hopes were amused by frequent pilgrimages to the baths, and to the tombs of the most popular saints; the monks applauded his penance, and, except restitution, (but to whom should he have restored?) <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> sought every method of expiating his guilt.
 While he groaned and prayed in sackcloth and ashes, his brother, the eunuch John, smiled at his remorse, and enjoyed the harvest of a crime of which himself was the secret and most guilty author.
 His administration was only the art of satiating his avarice, and <PERSON>Zoe</PERSON> became a captive in the palace of her fathers, and in the hands of her slaves.
 When he perceived the irretrievable decline of his brother's health, he introduced his nephew, another Michael, who derived his surname of <PERSON>Calaphates</PERSON> from his father's occupation in the careening of vessels: at the command of the eunuch, <PERSON>Zoe</PERSON> adopted for her son the son of a mechanic; and this fictitious heir was invested with the title and purple of the Caesars, in the presence of the senate and clergy.
 So feeble was the character of Zoe, that she was oppressed by the liberty and power Michael.
 Calaphates, A.
D 1041, Dec.
 14.
 which she recovered by the death of the Paphlagonian; and at the end of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> days, she placed the crown on the head of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the Fifth, who had protested, with tears and oaths, that he should ever reign the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most obedient of her subjects.
 The only act of his short reign was his base ingratitude to his benefactors, the eunuch and the empress.
 The disgrace of the former was pleasing to the public: but the murmurs, and at length the clamours, of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> deplored the exile of Zoe, the daughter of so many emperors; her vices were forgotten, and <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was taught, that there is a period in which the patience of the tamest slaves rises into fury and revenge.
 The citizens of every degree assembled in a formidable tumult which lasted <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days; they besieged the palace, forced the gates, recalled their mothers, <PERSON>Zoe</PERSON> from her prison, <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> from her monastery, and condemned the son of <PERSON>Calaphates</PERSON> to the loss of his eyes or of his life.
 <PERSON>Zoe</PERSON> and Theodora, A.
D 1042, April 21.
 For the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> beheld with surprise the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> royal sisters seated on the same throne, presiding in the senate, and giving audience to the ambassadors of the nations.
 But the singular union subsisted no more than <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> months; the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sovereigns, their tempers, interests, and adherents, were secretly hostile to each other; and as <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> was still averse to marriage, the indefatigable Zoe, at the age of sixty, consented, for the public good, to sustain the embraces of a <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> husband, and the censures of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> X.
 Monomachmus, A.
D 1042, June 11.
.
 His name and number were <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the Tenth, and the epithet of Monomachus, the single combatant, must have been expressive of his valour and victory in some public or private quarrel.
 But his health was broken by the tortures of the gout, and his dissolute reign was spent in the alternative of sickness and pleasure.
 A fair and noble widow had accompanied <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> in his exile to the Isle of Lesbos, and <PERSON>Sclerena</PERSON> gloried in the appellation of his mistress.
 After his marriage and elevation, she was invested with the title and pomp of Augusta, and occupied a contiguous apartment in the palace.
 The lawful consort (such was the delicacy or corruption of Zoe) consented to this strange and scandalous partition; and the emperor appeared in public between his wife and his concubine.
 He survived them both; but the last measures of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to change the order of succession were prevented by the more vigilant friends of Theodora; Theodora, A.
D 1054, Nov.
 30.
 and after his decease, she resumed, with the general consent, the possession of her inheritance.
 In her name, and by the influence of <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> eunuchs, the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> world was peaceably governed about nineteen months; and as they wished to prolong their dominion, they persuaded the aged princess to nominate for her successor <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> VI.
 Stratioticus, A.
D 1056, <DATE>August</DATE> 22.
 <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the Sixth.
 The surname of <PERSON>Stratioticus</PERSON> declares his military profession; but the crazy and decrepit veteran could only see with the eyes, and execute with the hands, of his ministers.
 Whilst he ascended the throne, <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> sunk into the grave; the last of the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> or <NORP>Basilian</NORP> dynasty.
 I have hastily reviewed, and gladly dismiss, this shameful and destructive period of twenty-eight years, in which the Greeks, degraded below the common level of servitude, were transferred like a herd of cattle by the choice or caprice of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> impotent females.
 <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> I.
 Comnenus, A.
D 1057, <DATE>August</DATE> 31.
 From this night of slavery, a ray of freedom, or at least of spirit, begins to emerge: the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> either preserved or revived the use of surnames, which perpetuate the fame of hereditary virtue: and we now discern the rise, succession, and alliances of the last dynasties of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> and Trebizond.
 The Comneni, who upheld for a while the fate of the sinking empire, assumed the honour of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> origin: but the family had been long since transported from <GPE>Italy</GPE> to Asia.
 Their patrimonial estate was situate in the district of Castamona, in the neighbourhood of the Euxine; and <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their chiefs, who had already entered the paths of ambition, revisited with affection, perhaps with regret, the modest though honourable dwelling of his fathers.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of their line was the illustrious Manuel, who in the reign of the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Basil, contributed by war and treaty to appease the troubles of the East: he left, in a tender age, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons, <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> and John, whom, with the consciousness of desert, he bequeathed to the gratitude and favour of his sovereign.
 The noble youths were carefully trained in the learning of the monastery, the arts of the palace, and the exercises of the camp: and from the domestic service of the guards, they were rapidly promoted to the command of provinces and armies.
 Their fraternal union doubled the force and reputation of the Comneni, and their ancient nobility was illustrated by the marriage of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers, with a captive princess of Bulgaria, and the daughter of a patrician, who had obtained the name of <PERSON>Charon</PERSON> from the number of enemies whom he had sent to the infernal shades.
 The soldiers had served with reluctant loyalty a series of effeminate masters; the elevation of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Sixth</ORDINAL> was a personal insult to the more deserving generals; and their discontent was inflamed by the parsimony of the emperor and the insolence of the eunuchs.
 They secretly assembled in the sanctuary of St.
 Sophia, and the votes of the military synod would have been unanimous in favour of the old and valiant Catacalon, if the patriotism or modesty of the veteran had not suggested the importance of birth as well as merit in the choice of a sovereign.
 <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> Comnenus was approved by general consent, and the associates separated without delay to meet in the plains of <GPE>Phrygia</GPE> at the head of their respective squadrons and detachments.
 The cause of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was defended in a single battle by the mercenaries of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> guard, who were aliens to the public interest, and animated only by a principle of honour and gratitude.
 After their defeat, the fears of the emperor solicited a treaty, which was almost accepted by the moderation of the Comnenian.
 But the former was betrayed by his ambassadors, and the latter was prevented by his friends.
 The solitary <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> submitted to the voice of the people; the patriarch annulled their oath of allegiance; and as he shaved the head of the royal monk, congratulated his beneficial exchange of temporal royalty for the kingdom of heaven; an exchange, however, which the priest, on his own account, would probably have declined.
 By the hands of the same patriarch, <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> Comnenus was solemnly crowned; the sword which he inscribed on his coins might be an offensive symbol, if it implied his title by conquest; but this sword would have been drawn against the foreign and domestic enemies of the state.
 The decline of his health and vigour suspended the operation of active virtue; and the prospect of approaching death determined him to interpose some moments between life and eternity.
 But instead of leaving the empire as the marriage portion of his daughter, his reason and inclination concurred in the preference of his brother John, a soldier, a patriot, and the father of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> sons, the future pillars of an hereditary succession.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> modest reluctance might be the natural dictates of discretion and tenderness, but his obstinate and successful perseverance, however it may dazzle with the show of virtue, must be censured as a criminal desertion of his duty, and a rare offence against his family and country.
 The purple which he had refused was accepted by <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> Ducas, a friend of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> house, and whose noble birth was adorned with the experience and reputation of civil policy.
 In the monastic habit, <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> recovered his health, and survived <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> years his voluntary abdication.
 At the command of his abbot, he observed the rule of St.
 Basil, and executed the most servile offices of the convent: but his latent vanity was gratified by the frequent and respectful visits of the reigning monarch, who revered in his person the character of a benefactor and a saint.
 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> XI.
 Ducas, A.
D 1059, Dec.
 25.
 If <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Eleventh</ORDINAL> were indeed the subject most worthy of empire, we must pity the debasement of the age and nation in which he was chosen.
 In the labor of puerile declamations he sought, without obtaining, the crown of eloquence, more precious, in his opinion, than that of Rome; and in the subordinate functions of a judge, he forgot the duties of a sovereign and a warrior.
 Far from imitating the patriotic indifference of the authors of his greatness, <GPE>Ducas</GPE> was anxious only to secure, at the expense of the republic, the power and prosperity of his children.
 His <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> sons, <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> the Seventh, <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> the First, and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the Twelfth, were invested, in a tender age, with the equal title of Augustus; and the succession was speedily opened by their father's death.
 Eudocia, A.
D 1067, May.
 His widow, Eudocia, was entrusted with the administration; but experience had taught the jealousy of the dying monarch to protect his sons from the danger of her <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> nuptials; and her solemn engagement, attested by the principal senators, was deposited in the hands of the patriarch.
 Before the end of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months, the wants of Eudocia, or those of the state, called aloud for the male virtues of a soldier; and her heart had already chosen <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> Diogenes, whom she raised from the scaffold to the throne.
 The discovery of a treasonable attempt had exposed him to the severity of the laws: his beauty and valour absolved him in the eyes of the empress; and Romanus, from a mild exile, was recalled on the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> day to the command of the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> armies.
 Her royal choice was yet unknown to the public; and the promise which would have betrayed her falsehood and levity, was stolen by a dexterous emissary from the ambition of the patriarch.
 <PERSON>Xiphilin</PERSON> at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> alleged the sanctity of oaths, and the sacred nature of a trust; but a whisper, that his brother was the future emperor, relaxed his scruples, and forced him to confess that the public safety was the supreme law.
 <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> III.
 Diogenes, A.
D 1067, August.
 He resigned the important paper; and when his hopes were confounded by the nomination of Romanus, he could no longer regain his security, retract his declarations, nor oppose the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> nuptials of the empress.
 Yet a murmur was heard in the palace; and the <NORP>Barbarian</NORP> guards had raised their battle-axes in the cause of the house of Lucas, till the young princes were soothed by the tears of their mother and the solemn assurances of the fidelity of their guardian, who filled the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> station with dignity and honour.
 Hereafter I shall relate his valiant, but unsuccessful, efforts to resist the progress of the Turks.
 His defeat and captivity inflicted a deadly wound on the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> monarchy of the East; and after he was released from the chains of the sultan, he vainly sought his wife and his subjects.
 His wife had been thrust into a monastery, and the subjects of <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> had embraced the rigid maxim of the civil law, that a prisoner in the hands of the enemy is deprived, as by the stroke of death, of all the public and private rights of a citizen.

 <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> XII, A.
D 1071, August.
 In the general consternation, the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> <PERSON>John</PERSON> asserted the indefeasible right of his <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> nephews: <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> listened to his voice: and the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> captive was proclaimed in the capital, and received on the frontier, as an enemy of the republic.
 <PERSON>Romanus</PERSON> was not more fortunate in domestic than in foreign war: the loss of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> battles compelled him to yield, on the assurance of fair and honourable treatment; but his enemies were devoid of faith or humanity; and, after the cruel extinction of his sight, his wounds were left to bleed and corrupt, till in a few days he was relieved from a state of misery.
 Under the triple reign of the house of Ducas, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> younger brothers were reduced to the vain honours of the purple; but the eldest, the pusillanimous Michael, was incapable of sustaining the <NORP>Roman</NORP> sceptre; and his surname of <PERSON>Parapinaces</PERSON> denotes the reproach which he shared with an avaricious favourite, who enhanced the price, and diminished the measure, of wheat.
 In the school of Psellus, and after the example of his mother, the son of <PERSON>Eudocia</PERSON> made some proficiency in philosophy and rhetoric; but his character was degraded, rather than ennobled, by the virtues of a monk and the learning of a sophist.
 Strong in the contempt of their sovereign and their own esteem, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals, at the head of the <NORP>European</NORP> and <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> legions, assumed the purple at <ORG>Adrianople</ORG> and Nice.
 Their revolt was in the same months; they bore the same name of Nicephorus; but the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> candidates were distinguished by the surnames of <PERSON>Bryennius</PERSON> and Botaniates; the former in the maturity of wisdom and courage, the latter conspicuous only by the memory of his past exploits.
 While <PERSON>Botaniates</PERSON> advanced with cautious and dilatory steps, his active competitor stood in arms before the gates of Constantinople.
 The name of <PERSON>Bryennius</PERSON> was illustrious; his cause was popular; but his licentious troops could not be restrained from burning and pillaging a suburb; and the people, who would have hailed the rebel, rejected and repulsed the incendiary of his country.
 This change of the public opinion was favourable to Botaniates, who at length, with an army of Turks, approached the shores of Chalcedon.
 A formal invitation, in the name of the patriarch, the synod, and the senate, was circulated through the streets of Constantinople; and the general assembly, in the dome of St.
 Sophia, debated, with order and calmness, on the choice of their sovereign.
 The guards of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> would have dispersed this unarmed multitude; but the feeble emperor, applauding his own moderation and clemency, resigned the ensigns of royalty, and was rewarded with the monastic habit, and the title of Archbishop of Ephesus.
 He left a son, a Constantine, born and educated in the purple; and a daughter of the house of <GPE>Ducas</GPE> illustrated the blood, and confirmed the succession, of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> dynasty.
 <PERSON>Nicephorus</PERSON> III.
 Botaniates, A.
D 1078, March 25.
 <PERSON>John</PERSON> Comnenus, the brother of the emperor Isaac, survived in peace and dignity his generous refusal of the sceptre.
 By his wife Anne, a woman of masculine spirit and a policy, he left <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> children: the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> daughters multiplied the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> alliance with the noblest of the Greeks: of the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> sons, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was stopped by a premature death; <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> and <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> restored the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> greatness of their house, which was enjoyed without toil or danger by the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> younger brethren, <PERSON>Adrian</PERSON> and Nicephorus.
 Alexius, the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> and most illustrious of the brothers was endowed by nature with the choicest gifts both of mind and body: they were cultivated by a liberal education, and exercised in the school of obedience and adversity.
 The youth was dismissed from the perils of the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> war, by the paternal care of the emperor Romanus: but the mother of the Comneni, with her aspiring face, was accused of treason, and banished, by the sons of Ducas, to an island in the Propontis.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers soon emerged into favour and action, fought by each other's side against the rebels and Barbarians, and adhered to the emperor Michael, till he was deserted by the world and by himself.
 In his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> interview with Botaniates,The successor of <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> entertained him with esteem and confidence: his valour was employed against <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> rebels, who disturbed the peace of the empire, or at least of the emperors.
 Ursel, Bryennius, and Basilacius, were formidable by their numerous forces and military fame: they were successively vanquished in the field, and led in chains to the foot of the throne; and whatever treatment they might receive from a timid and cruel court, they applauded the clemency, as well as the courage, of their conqueror.
 But the loyalty of the <NORP>Comneni</NORP> was soon tainted by fear and suspicion; nor is it easy to settle between a subject and a despot, the debt of gratitude, which the former is tempted to claim by a revolt, and the latter to discharge by an executioner.
 The refusal of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> to march against a <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> rebel, the husband of his sister, destroyed the merit or memory of his past services: the favourites of <PERSON>Botaniates</PERSON> provoked the ambition which they apprehended and accused; and the retreat of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers might be justified by the defence of their life and liberty.
 The women of the family were deposited in a sanctuary, respected by tyrants: the men, mounted on horseback, sallied from the city, and erected the standard of civil war.
 The soldiers who had been gradually assembled in the capital and the neighbourhood, were devoted to the cause of a victorious and injured leader: the ties of common interest and domestic alliance secured the attachment of the house of Ducas; and the generous dispute of the <NORP>Comneni</NORP> was terminated by the decisive resolution of Isaac, who was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to invest his younger brother with the name and ensigns of royalty.
 They returned to Constantinople, to threaten rather than besiege that impregnable fortress; but the fidelity of the guards was corrupted; a gate was surprised, and the fleet was occupied by the active courage of George Palaeologus, who fought against his father, without foreseeing that he labored for his posterity.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> ascended the throne; and his aged competitor disappeared in a monastery.
 An army of various nations was gratified with the pillage of the city; but the public disorders were expiated by the tears and fasts of the Comneni, who submitted to every penance compatible with the possession of the empire.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> I.
 Comnensus, A.
D 1081, April 1.
 The life of the emperor <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> has been delineated by a favourite daughter, who was inspired by a tender regard for his person and a laudable zeal to perpetuate his virtues.
 Conscious of the just suspicions of her readers, the princess <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> Comnena repeatedly protests, that, besides her personal knowledge, she had searched the discourses and writings of the most respectable veterans: and after an interval of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> years, forgotten by, and forgetful of, the world, her mournful solitude was inaccessible to hope and fear; and that truth, the naked perfect truth, was more dear and sacred than the memory of her parent.
 Yet, instead of the simplicity of style and narrative which wins our belief, an elaborate affectation of rhetoric and science betrays in every page the vanity of a female author.
 The genuine character of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> is lost in a vague constellation of virtues; and the perpetual strain of panegyric and apology awakens our jealousy, to question the veracity of the historian and the merit of the hero.
 We cannot, however, refuse her judicious and important remark, that the disorders of the times were the misfortune and the glory of Alexius; and that every calamity which can afflict a declining empire was accumulated on his reign by the justice of Heaven and the vices of his predecessors.
 In the East, the victorious <NORP>Turks</NORP> had spread, from <GPE>Persia</GPE> to the Hellespont, the reign of the <WORK_OF_ART>Koran</WORK_OF_ART> and the Crescent: the <LOC>West</LOC> was invaded by the adventurous valour of the Normans; and, in the moments of peace, the <LOC>Danube</LOC> poured forth new swarms, who had gained, in the science of war, what they had lost in the ferociousness of manners.
 The sea was not less hostile than the land; and while the frontiers were assaulted by an open enemy, the palace was distracted with secret treason and conspiracy.
 On a sudden, the banner of the <PERSON>Cross</PERSON> was displayed by the Latins; <LOC>Europe</LOC> was precipitated on Asia; and <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> had almost been swept away by this impetuous deluge.
 In the tempest, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> steered the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> vessel with dexterity and courage.
 At the head of his armies, he was bold in action, skilful in stratagem, patient of fatigue, ready to improve his advantages, and rising from his defeats with inexhaustible vigour.
 The discipline of the camp was revived, and a new generation of men and soldiers was created by the example and precepts of their leader.
 In his intercourse with the Latins, <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was patient and artful: his discerning eye pervaded the new system of an unknown world and I shall hereafter describe the superior policy with which he balanced the interests and passions of the champions of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> crusade.
 In a long reign of thirty- <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years, he subdued and pardoned the envy of his equals: the laws of public and private order were restored: the arts of wealth and science were cultivated: the limits of the empire were enlarged in <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia; and the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> sceptre was transmitted to his children of the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>fourth</ORDINAL> generation.
 Yet the difficulties of the times betrayed some defects in his character; and have exposed his memory to some just or ungenerous reproach.
 The reader may possibly smile at the lavish praise which his daughter so often bestows on a flying hero: the weakness or prudence of his situation might be mistaken for a want of personal courage; and his political arts are branded by the <NORP>Latins</NORP> with the names of deceit and dissimulation.
 The increase of the male and female branches of his family adorned the throne, and secured the succession; but their princely luxury and pride offended the patricians, exhausted the revenue, and insulted the misery of the people.
 <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> is a faithful witness that his happiness was destroyed, and his health was broken, by the cares of a public life; the patience of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> was fatigued by the length and severity of his reign; and before <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> expired, he had lost the love and reverence of his subjects.
 The clergy could not forgive his application of the sacred riches to the defence of the state; but they applauded his theological learning and ardent zeal for the orthodox faith, which he defended with his tongue, his pen, and his sword.
 His character was degraded by the superstition of the Greeks; and the same inconsistent principle of human nature enjoined the emperor to found a hospital for the poor and infirm, and to direct the execution of a heretic, who was burned alive in the square of St.
 Sophia.
 Even the sincerity of his moral and religious virtues was suspected by the persons who had passed their lives in his familiar confidence.
 In his last hours, when he was pressed by his wife <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> to alter the succession, he raised his head, and breathed a pious ejaculation on the vanity of this world.
 The indignant reply of the empress may be inscribed as an epitaph on his tomb,John, or Calo-Johannes, A.
D 1118, <DATE>August</DATE> 15.
 It was the wish of <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> to supplant the eldest of her surviving sons, in favour of her daughter the princess <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> whose philosophy would not have refused the weight of a diadem.
 But the order of male succession was asserted by the friends of their country; the lawful heir drew the royal signet from the finger of his insensible or conscious father and the empire obeyed the master of the palace.
 <PERSON>Anna</PERSON> Comnena was stimulated by ambition and revenge to conspire against the life of her brother, and when the design was prevented by the fears or scruples of her husband, she passionately exclaimed that nature had mistaken the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sexes, and had endowed <PERSON>Bryennius</PERSON> with the soul of a woman.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons of Alexius, <PERSON>John</PERSON> and Isaac, maintained the fraternal concord, the hereditary virtue of their race, and the younger brother was content with the title of Sebastocrator, which approached the dignity, without sharing the power, of the emperor.
 In the same person the claims of primogeniture and merit were fortunately united; his swarthy complexion, harsh features, and diminutive stature, had suggested the ironical surname of Calo-Johannes, or <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Handsome, which his grateful subjects more seriously applied to the beauties of his mind.
 After the discovery of her treason, the life and fortune of <PERSON>Anne</PERSON> were justly forfeited to the laws.
 Her life was spared by the clemency of the emperor; but he visited the pomp and treasures of her palace, and bestowed the rich confiscation on the most deserving of his friends.
 That respectable friend Axuch, a slave of <NORP>Turkish</NORP> extraction, presumed to decline the gift, and to intercede for the criminal: his generous master applauded and imitated the virtue of his favourite, and the reproach or complaint of an injured brother was the only chastisement of the guilty princess.
 After this example of clemency, the remainder of his reign was never disturbed by conspiracy or rebellion: feared by his nobles, beloved by his people, <PERSON>John</PERSON> was never reduced to the painful necessity of punishing, or even of pardoning, his personal enemies.
 During his government of twenty-five years, the penalty of death was abolished in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, a law of mercy most delightful to the humane theorist, but of which the practice, in a large and vicious community, is seldom consistent with the public safety.
 Severe to himself, indulgent to others, chaste, frugal, abstemious, the philosophic <PERSON>Marcus</PERSON> would not have disdained the artless virtues of his successor, derived from his heart, and not borrowed from the schools.
 He despised and moderated the stately magnificence of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> court, so oppressive to the people, so contemptible to the eye of reason.
 Under such a prince, innocence had nothing to fear, and merit had every thing to hope; and, without assuming the tyrannic office of a censor, he introduced a gradual though visible reformation in the public and private manners of Constantinople.
 The only defect of this accomplished character was the frailty of noble minds, the love of arms and military glory.
 Yet the frequent expeditions of <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Handsome may be justified, at least in their principle, by the necessity of repelling the <NORP>Turks</NORP> from the <GPE>Hellespont</GPE> and the Bosphorus.
 The sultan of Iconium was confined to his capital, the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> were driven to the mountains, and the maritime provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> enjoyed the transient blessings of their deliverance.
 From <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to <GPE>Antioch</GPE> and Aleppo, he repeatedly marched at the head of a victorious army, and in the sieges and battles of this holy war, his <NORP>Latin</NORP> allies were astonished by the superior spirit and prowess of a Greek.
 As he began to indulge the ambitious hope of restoring the ancient limits of the empire, as he revolved in his mind, the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> and Tigris, the dominion of Syria, and the conquest of Jerusalem, the thread of his life and of the public felicity was broken by a singular accident.
 He hunted the wild boar in the valley of Anazarbus, and had fixed his javelin in the body of the furious animal; but in the struggle a poisoned arrow dropped from his quiver, and a slight wound in his hand, which produced a mortification, was fatal to the best and greatest of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> princes.
 Manuel, A.
D 1143, April 8.
 A premature death had swept away the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> eldest sons of <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Handsome; of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> survivors, <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> and Manuel, his judgment or affection preferred the younger; and the choice of their dying prince was ratified by the soldiers, who had applauded the valour of his favourite in the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> war The faithful <PERSON>Axuch</PERSON> hastened to the capital, secured the person of <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> in honourable confinement, and purchased, with a gift of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> pounds of silver, the leading ecclesiastics of St.
 Sophia, who possessed a decisive voice in the consecration of an emperor.
 With his veteran and affectionate troops, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> soon visited Constantinople; his brother acquiesced in the title of Sebastocrator; his subjects admired the lofty stature and martial graces of their new sovereign, and listened with credulity to the flattering promise, that he blended the wisdom of age with the activity and vigour of youth.
 By the experience of his government, they were taught, that he emulated the spirit, and shared the talents, of his father whose social virtues were buried in the grave.
 A reign of <CARDINAL>thirty</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> years is filled by a perpetual though various warfare against the Turks, the Christians, and the hordes of the wilderness beyond the Danube.
 The arms of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> were exercised on Mount Taurus, in the plains of Hungary, on the coast of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and Egypt, and on the seas of <GPE>Sicily</GPE> and Greece: the influence of his negotiations extended from <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> and Russia; and the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> monarchy, for a while, became an object of respect or terror to the powers of <LOC>Asia</LOC> and Europe.
 Educated in the silk and purple of the East, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> possessed the iron temper of a soldier, which cannot easily be paralleled, except in the lives of Richard the <ORDINAL>First</ORDINAL> of England, and of Charles the Twelfth of Sweden.
 Such was his strength and exercise in arms, that Raymond, surnamed the <PERSON>Hercules</PERSON> of Antioch, was incapable of wielding the lance and buckler of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperor.
 In a famous tournament, he entered the lists on a fiery courser, and overturned in his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> career <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of the stoutest of the <NORP>Italian</NORP> knights.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> in the charge, the last in the retreat, his friends and his enemies alike trembled, the former for his safety, and the latter for their own.
 After posting an ambuscade in a wood, he rode forwards in search of some perilous adventure, accompanied only by his brother and the faithful Axuch, who refused to desert their sovereign.
 <CARDINAL>Eighteen</CARDINAL> horsemen, after a short combat, fled before them: but the numbers of the enemy increased; the march of the reinforcement was tardy and fearful, and Manuel, without receiving a wound, cut his way through a squadron of <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> Turks.
 In a battle against the Hungarians, impatient of the slowness of his troops, he snatched a standard from the head of the column, and was the first, almost alone, who passed a bridge that separated him from the enemy.
 In the same country, after transporting his army beyond the Save, he sent back the boats, with an order under pain of death, to their commander, that he should leave him to conquer or die on that hostile land.
 In the siege of Corfu, towing after him a captive galley, the emperor stood aloft on the poop, opposing against the volleys of darts and stones, a large buckler and a flowing sail; nor could he have escaped inevitable death, had not the <NORP>Sicilian</NORP> admiral enjoined his archers to respect the person of a hero.
 In <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> day, he is said to have slain above <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> of the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> with his own hand; he returned to the camp, dragging along <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <NORP>Turkish</NORP> prisoners, whom he had tied to the rings of his saddle: he was ever the foremost to provoke or to accept a single combat; and the gigantic champions, who encountered his arm, were transpierced by the lance, or cut asunder by the sword, of the invincible Manuel.
 The story of his exploits, which appear as a model or a copy of the romances of chivalry, may induce a reasonable suspicion of the veracity of the Greeks: I will not, to vindicate their credit, endanger my own: yet I may observe, that, in the long series of their annals, <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> is the only prince who has been the subject of similar exaggeration.
 With the valour of a soldier, he did no unite the skill or prudence of a general; his victories were not productive of any permanent or useful conquest; and his <NORP>Turkish</NORP> laurels were blasted in his last unfortunate campaign, in which he lost his army in the mountains of Pisidia, and owed his deliverance to the generosity of the sultan.
 But the most singular feature in the character of Manuel, is the contrast and vicissitude of labor and sloth, of hardiness and effeminacy.
 In war he seemed ignorant of peace, in peace he appeared incapable of war.
 In the field he slept in the sun or in the snow, tired in the longest marches the strength of his men and horses, and shared with a smile the abstinence or diet of the camp.
 No sooner did he return to Constantinople, than he resigned himself to the arts and pleasures of a life of luxury: the expense of his dress, his table, and his palace, surpassed the measure of his predecessors, and whole summer days were idly wasted in the delicious isles of the Propontis, in the incestuous love of his niece Theodora.
 The double cost of a warlike and dissolute prince exhausted the revenue, and multiplied the taxes; and Manuel, in the distress of his last <NORP>Turkish</NORP> campaign, endured a bitter reproach from the mouth of a desperate soldier.
 As he quenched his thirst, he complained that the water of a fountain was mingled with <NORP>Christian</NORP> blood.
 <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> Comnenus was twice married, to the virtuous <PERSON>Bertha</PERSON> or <PERSON>Irene</PERSON> of Germany, and to the beauteous Maria, a <NORP>French</NORP> or <NORP>Latin</NORP> princess of Antioch.
 The only daughter of his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> wife was destined for Bela, a <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> prince, who was educated at <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> under the name of Alexius; and the consummation of their nuptials might have transferred the <NORP>Roman</NORP> sceptre to a race of free and warlike Barbarians.
 But as soon as <PERSON>Maria</PERSON> of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> had given a son and heir to the empire, the presumptive rights of <PERSON>Bela</PERSON> were abolished, and he was deprived of his promised bride; but the <NORP>Hungarian</NORP> prince resumed his name and the kingdom of his fathers, and displayed such virtues as might excite the regret and envy of the Greeks.
 The son of <PERSON>Maria</PERSON> was named Alexius; and at the age of ten years he ascended the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> throne, after his father's decease had closed the glories of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> line.
 <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> II.
, A.
D 1180, Sept.
 24.
 The fraternal concord of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sons of the great <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> had been sometimes clouded by an opposition of interest and passion.
 By ambition, <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> the <WORK_OF_ART>Sebastocrator</WORK_OF_ART> was excited to flight and rebellion, from whence he was reclaimed by the firmness and clemency of <PERSON>John</PERSON> the Handsome.
 The errors of Isaac, the father of the emperors of Trebizond, were short and venial; but John, the elder of his sons, renounced forever his religion.
 Provoked by a real or imaginary insult of his uncle, he escaped from the <NORP>Roman</NORP> to the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> camp: his apostasy was rewarded with the sultan's daughter, the title of Chelebi, or noble, and the inheritance of a princely estate; and in the fifteenth century, <PERSON>Mahomet</PERSON> the <ORDINAL>Second</ORDINAL> boasted of his <NORP>Imperial</NORP> descent from the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> family.
 Character and <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> adventures of Andronicus.
 Andronicus, the younger brother of John, son of Isaac, and grandson of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> Comnenus, is <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most conspicuous characters of the age; and his genuine adventures might form the subject of a very singular romance.
 To justify the choice of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ladies of royal birth, it is incumbent on me to observe, that their fortunate lover was cast in the best proportions of strength and beauty; and that the want of the softer graces was supplied by a manly countenance, a lofty stature, athletic muscles, and the air and deportment of a soldier.
 The preservation, in his old age, of health and vigour, was the reward of temperance and exercise.
 A piece of bread and a draught of water was often his sole and evening repast; and if he tasted of a wild boar or a stag, which he had roasted with his own hands, it was the well-earned fruit of a laborious chase.
 Dexterous in arms, he was ignorant of fear; his persuasive eloquence could bend to every situation and character of life, his style, though not his practice, was fashioned by the example of St.
 Paul; and, in every deed of mischief, he had a heart to resolve, a head to contrive, and a hand to execute.
 In his youth, after the death of the emperor John, he followed the retreat of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army; but, in the march through <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, design or accident tempted him to wander in the mountains: the hunter was encompassed by the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> huntsmen, and he remained some time a reluctant or willing captive in the power of the sultan.
 His virtues and vices recommended him to the favour of his cousin: he shared the perils and the pleasures of Manuel; and while the emperor lived in public incest with his niece Theodora, the affections of her sister <PERSON>Eudocia</PERSON> were seduced and enjoyed by Andronicus.
 Above the decencies of her sex and rank, she gloried in the name of his concubine; and both the palace and the camp could witness that she slept, or watched, in the arms of her lover.
 She accompanied him to his military command of Cilicia, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> scene of his valour and imprudence.
 He pressed, with active ardour, the siege of Mopsuestia: the day was employed in the boldest attacks; but the night was wasted in song and dance; and a band of <NORP>Greek</NORP> comedians formed the choicest part of his retinue.
 <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> was surprised by the sally of a vigilant foe; but, while his troops fled in disorder, his invincible lance transpierced the thickest ranks of the Armenians.
 On his return to the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> camp in Macedonia, he was received by <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> with public smiles and a private reproof; but the duchies of Naissus, Braniseba, and Castoria, were the reward or consolation of the unsuccessful general.
 <PERSON>Eudocia</PERSON> still attended his motions: at midnight, their tent was suddenly attacked by her angry brothers, impatient to expiate her infamy in his blood: his daring spirit refused her advice, and the disguise of a female habit; and, boldly starting from his couch, he drew his sword, and cut his way through the numerous assassins.
 It was here that he <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> betrayed his ingratitude and treachery: he engaged in a treasonable correspondence with the king of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> and the <NORP>German</NORP> emperor; approached the royal tent at a suspicious hour with a drawn sword, and under the mask of a <NORP>Latin</NORP> soldier, avowed an intention of revenge against a mortal foe; and imprudently praised the fleetness of his horse as an instrument of flight and safety.
 The monarch dissembled his suspicions; but, after the close of the campaign, <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> was arrested and strictly confined in a tower of the palace of Constantinople.
 In this prison he was left about <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> years; a most painful restraint, from which the thirst of action and pleasure perpetually urged him to escape.
 Alone and pensive, he perceived some broken bricks in a corner of the chamber, and gradually widened the passage, till he had explored a dark and forgotten recess.
 Into this hole he conveyed himself, and the remains of his provisions, replacing the bricks in their former position, and erasing with care the footsteps of his retreat.
 At the hour of the customary visit, his guards were amazed by the silence and solitude of the prison, and reported, with shame and fear, his incomprehensible flight.
 The gates of the palace and city were instantly shut: the strictest orders were despatched into the provinces, for the recovery of the fugitive; and his wife, on the suspicion of a pious act, was basely imprisoned in the same tower.
 At the dead of night she beheld a spectre; she recognized her husband: they shared their provisions; and a son was the fruit of these stolen interviews, which alleviated the tediousness of their confinement.
 In the custody of a woman, the vigilance of the keepers was insensibly relaxed; and the captive had accomplished his real escape, when he was discovered, brought back to Constantinople, and loaded with a double chain.
 At length he found the moment, and the means, of his deliverance.
 A boy, his domestic servant, intoxicated the guards, and obtained in wax the impression of the keys.
 By the diligence of his friends, a similar key, with a bundle of ropes, was introduced into the prison, in the bottom of a hogshead.
 <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> employed, with industry and courage, the instruments of his safety, unlocked the doors, descended from the tower, concealed himself all day among the bushes, and scaled in the night the garden-wall of the palace.
 A boat was stationed for his reception: he visited his own house, embraced his children, cast away his chain, mounted a fleet horse, and directed his rapid course towards the banks of the Danube.
 At <LOC>Anchialus</LOC> in Thrace, an intrepid friend supplied him with horses and money: he passed the river, traversed with speed the desert of <GPE>Moldavia</GPE> and the Carpathian hills, and had almost reached the town of Halicz, in the <NORP>Polish</NORP> Russia, when he was intercepted by a party of Walachians, who resolved to convey their important captive to Constantinople.
 His presence of mind again extricated him from danger.
 Under the pretence of sickness, he dismounted in the night, and was allowed to step aside from the troop: he planted in the ground his long staff, clothed it with his cap and upper garment; and, stealing into the wood, left a phantom to amuse, for some time, the eyes of the Walachians.
 From <PERSON>Halicz</PERSON> he was honourably conducted to Kiow, the residence of the great duke: the subtle <NORP>Greek</NORP> soon obtained the esteem and confidence of Ieroslaus; his character could assume the manners of every climate; and the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> applauded his strength and courage in the chase of the elks and bears of the forest.
 In this northern region he deserved the forgiveness of Manuel, who solicited the <NORP>Russian</NORP> prince to join his arms in the invasion of Hungary.
 The influence of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> achieved this important service: his private treaty was signed with a promise of fidelity on <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> side, and of oblivion on the other; and he marched, at the head of the <NORP>Russian</NORP> cavalry, from the <LOC>Borysthenes</LOC> to the Danube.
 In his resentment <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> had ever sympathized with the martial and dissolute character of his cousin; and his free pardon was sealed in the assault of Zemlin, in which he was second, and <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> only, to the valour of the emperor.
 No sooner was the exile restored to freedom and his country, than his ambition revived, at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> to his own, and at length to the public, misfortune.
 A daughter of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> was a feeble bar to the succession of the more deserving males of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> blood; her future marriage with the prince of <GPE>Hungary</GPE> was repugnant to the hopes or prejudices of the princes and nobles.
 But when an oath of allegiance was required to the presumptive heir, <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> alone asserted the honour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> name, declined the unlawful engagement, and boldly protested against the adoption of a stranger.
 His patriotism was offensive to the emperor, but he spoke the sentiments of the people, and was removed from the royal presence by an honourable banishment, a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> command of the <NORP>Cilician</NORP> frontier, with the absolute disposal of the revenues of Cyprus.
 In this station the <NORP>Armenians</NORP> again exercised his courage and exposed his negligence; and the same rebel, who baffled all his operations, was unhorsed, and almost slain by the vigour of his lance.
 But <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> soon discovered a more easy and pleasing conquest, the beautiful Philippa, sister of the empress Maria, and daughter of <PERSON>Raymond</PERSON> of Poitou, the <NORP>Latin</NORP> prince of Antioch.
 For her sake he deserted his station, and wasted the summer in balls and tournaments: to his love she sacrificed her innocence, her reputation, and the offer of an advantageous marriage.
 But the resentment of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> for this domestic affront interrupted his pleasures: <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> left the indiscreet princess to weep and to repent; and, with a band of desperate adventurers, undertook the pilgrimage of Jerusalem.
 His birth, his martial renown, and professions of zeal, announced him as the champion of the Cross: he soon captivated both the clergy and the king; and the <NORP>Greek</NORP> prince was invested with the lordship of Berytus, on the coast of Phoenicia.
 In his neighbourhood resided a young and handsome queen, of his own nation and family, great-granddaughter of the emperor Alexis, and widow of <PERSON>Baldwin</PERSON> the Third, king of Jerusalem.
 She visited and loved her kinsman.
 <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> was the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> victim of his amorous seduction; and her shame was more public and scandalous than that of her predecessors.
 The emperor still thirsted for revenge; and his subjects and allies of the <NORP>Syrian</NORP> frontier were repeatedly pressed to seize the person, and put out the eyes, of the fugitive.
 In <GPE>Palestine</GPE> he was no longer safe; but the tender <PERSON>Theodora</PERSON> revealed his danger, and accompanied his flight.
 The queen of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> was exposed to the East, his obsequious concubine; and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> illegitimate children were the living monuments of her weakness.
 <GPE>Damascus</GPE> was his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> refuge; and, in the characters of the great <PERSON>Noureddin</PERSON> and his servant Saladin, the superstitious <NORP>Greek</NORP> might learn to revere the virtues of the Mussulmans.
 As the friend of <PERSON>Noureddin</PERSON> he visited, most probably, Bagdad, and the courts of Persia; and, after a long circuit round the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> Sea and the mountains of Georgia, he finally settled among the <NORP>Turks</NORP> of <LOC>Asia</LOC> Minor, the hereditary enemies of his country.
 The sultan of <GPE>Colonia</GPE> afforded a hospitable retreat to Andronicus, his mistress, and his band of outlaws: the debt of gratitude was paid by frequent inroads in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> province of Trebizond; and he seldom returned without an ample harvest of spoil and of <NORP>Christian</NORP> captives.
 In the story of his adventures, he was fond of comparing himself to David, who escaped, by a long exile, the snares of the wicked.
 But the royal prophet (he presumed to add) was content to lurk on the borders of Judaea, to slay an Amalekite, and to threaten, in his miserable state, the life of the avaricious Nabal.
 The excursions of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> prince had a wider range; and he had spread over the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> world the glory of his name and religion.
 By a sentence of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> church, the licentious rover had been separated from the faithful; but even this excommunication may prove, that he never abjured the profession of Christianity.
 His vigilance had eluded or repelled the open and secret persecution of the emperor; but he was at length ensnared by the captivity of his female companion.
 The governor of <NORP>Trebizond</NORP> succeeded in his attempt to surprise the person of Theodora: the queen of <GPE>Jerusalem</GPE> and her <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> children were sent to Constantinople, and their loss embittered the tedious solitude of banishment.
 The fugitive implored and obtained a final pardon, with leave to throw himself at the feet of his sovereign, who was satisfied with the submission of this haughty spirit.
 Prostrate on the ground, he deplored with tears and groans the guilt of his past rebellion; nor would he presume to arise, unless some faithful subject would drag him to the foot of the throne, by an iron chain with which he had secretly encircled his neck.
 This extraordinary penance excited the wonder and pity of the assembly; his sins were forgiven by the church and state; but the just suspicion of <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> fixed his residence at a distance from the court, at Oenoe, a town of Pontus, surrounded with rich vineyards, and situate on the coast of the Euxine.
 The death of Manuel, and the disorders of the minority, soon opened the fairest field to his ambition.
 The emperor was a boy of <CARDINAL>twelve</CARDINAL> or fourteen years of age, without vigour, or wisdom, or experience: his mother, the empress Mary, abandoned her person and government to a favourite of the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> name; and his sister, another Mary, whose husband, an Italian, was decorated with the title of Caesar, excited a conspiracy, and at length an insurrection, against her odious step-mother.
 The provinces were forgotten, the capital was in flames, and a century of peace and order was overthrown in the vice and weakness of a few months.
 A civil war was kindled in Constantinople; the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> factions fought a bloody battle in the square of the palace, and the rebels sustained a regular siege in the cathedral of St.
 Sophia.
 The patriarch labored with honest zeal to heal the wounds of the republic, the most respectable patriots called aloud for a guardian and avenger, and every tongue repeated the praise of the talents and even the virtues of Andronicus.
 In his retirement, he affected to revolve the solemn duties of his oath:His correspondence with the patriarch and patricians was seasoned with apt quotations from the Psalms of <PERSON>David</PERSON> and the epistles of St.
 Paul; and he patiently waited till he was called to her deliverance by the voice of his country.
 In his march from <GPE>Oenoe</GPE> to Constantinople, his slender train insensibly swelled to a crowd and an army: his professions of religion and loyalty were mistaken for the language of his heart; and the simplicity of a foreign dress, which showed to advantage his majestic stature, displayed a lively image of his poverty and exile.
 All opposition sunk before him; he reached the straits of the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> Bosphorus; the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> navy sailed from the harbor to receive and transport the saviour of the empire: the torrent was loud and irresistible, and the insects who had basked in the sunshine of royal favour disappeared at the blast of the storm.
 It was the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> care of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> to occupy the palace, to salute the emperor, to confine his mother, to punish her minister, and to restore the public order and tranquillity.
 He then visited the sepulchre of Manuel: the spectators were ordered to stand aloof, but as he bowed in the attitude of prayer, they heard, or thought they heard, a murmur of triumph or revenge: From his subsequent tyranny we may impute such feelings to the man and the moment; but it is not extremely probable that he gave an articulate sound to his secret thoughts.
 In the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> months of his administration, his designs were veiled by a fair semblance of hypocrisy, which could delude only the eyes of the multitude; the coronation of <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> was performed with due solemnity, and his perfidious guardian, holding in his hands the body and blood of Christ, most fervently declared that he lived, and was ready to die, for the service of his beloved pupil.
 But his numerous adherents were instructed to maintain, that the sinking empire must perish in the hands of a child, that the <NORP>Romans</NORP> could only be saved by a veteran prince, bold in arms, skilful in policy, and taught to reign by the long experience of fortune and mankind; and that it was the duty of every citizen to force the reluctant modesty of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> to undertake the burden of the public care.
 The young emperor was himself constrained to join his voice to the general acclamation, and to solicit the association of a colleague, who instantly degraded him from the supreme rank, secluded his person, and verified the rash declaration of the patriarch, that <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> might be considered as dead, so soon as he was committed to the custody of his guardian.
 But his death was preceded by the imprisonment and execution of his mother.
 After blackening her reputation, and inflaming against her the passions of the multitude, the tyrant accused and tried the empress for a treasonable correspondence with the king of Hungary.
 His own son, a youth of honour and humanity, avowed his abhorrence of this flagitious act, and <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> of the judges had the merit of preferring their conscience to their safety: but the obsequious tribunal, without requiring any reproof, or hearing any defence, condemned the widow of Manuel; and her unfortunate son subscribed the sentence of her death.
 <PERSON>Maria</PERSON> was strangled, her corpse was buried in the sea, and her memory was wounded by the insult most offensive to female vanity, a false and ugly representation of her beauteous form.
 The fate of her son was not long deferred: he was strangled with a bowstring; and the tyrant, insensible to pity or remorse, after surveying the body of the innocent youth, struck it rudely with his foot:Andronicus I.
 Comnenus, A.
D 1183, October.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> sceptre, the reward of his crimes, was held by <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> years and a half as the guardian or sovereign of the empire.
 His government exhibited a singular contrast of vice and virtue.
 When he listened to his passions, he was the scourge; when he consulted his reason, the father, of his people.
 In the exercise of private justice, he was equitable and rigorous: a shameful and pernicious venality was abolished, and the offices were filled with the most deserving candidates, by a prince who had sense to choose, and severity to punish.
 He prohibited the inhuman practice of pillaging the goods and persons of shipwrecked mariners; the provinces, so long the objects of oppression or neglect, revived in prosperity and plenty; and <CARDINAL>millions</CARDINAL> applauded the distant blessings of his reign, while he was cursed by the witnesses of his daily cruelties.
 The ancient proverb, That bloodthirsty is the man who returns from banishment to power, had been applied, with too much truth, to 'Marius and Tiberius; and was now verified for the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> time in the life of Andronicus.
 His memory was stored with a black list of the enemies and rivals, who had traduced his merit, opposed his greatness, or insulted his misfortunes; and the only comfort of his exile was the sacred hope and promise of revenge.
 The necessary extinction of the young emperor and his mother imposed the fatal obligation of extirpating the friends, who hated, and might punish, the assassin; and the repetition of murder rendered him less willing, and less able, to forgive.
 A horrid narrative of the victims whom he sacrificed by poison or the sword, by the sea or the flames, would be less expressive of his cruelty than the appellation of the halcyon days, which was applied to a rare and bloodless week of repose: the tyrant strove to transfer, on the laws and the judges, some portion of his guilt; but the mask was fallen, and his subjects could no longer mistake the true author of their calamities.
 The noblest of the Greeks, more especially those who, by descent or alliance, might dispute the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> inheritance, escaped from the monster's den: <PERSON>Nice</PERSON> and Prusa, <GPE>Sicily</GPE> or Cyprus, were their places of refuge; and as their flight was already criminal, they aggravated their offence by an open revolt, and the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> title.
 Yet <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> resisted the daggers and swords of his most formidable enemies: <PERSON>Nice</PERSON> and <PERSON>Prusa</PERSON> were reduced and chastised: the <NORP>Sicilians</NORP> were content with the sack of Thessalonica; and the distance of <GPE>Cyprus</GPE> was not more propitious to the rebel than to the tyrant.
 His throne was subverted by a rival without merit, and a people without arms.
 <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> Angelus, a descendant in the female line from the great Alexius, was marked as a victim by the prudence or superstition of the emperor.
 In a moment of despair, <PERSON>Angelus</PERSON> defended his life and liberty, slew the executioner, and fled to the church of St.
 Sophia.
 The sanctuary was insensibly filled with a curious and mournful crowd, who, in his fate, prognosticated their own.
 But their lamentations were soon turned to curses, and their curses to threats: they dared to ask,With the dawn of day the city burst into a general sedition, the prisons were thrown open, the coldest and most servile were roused to the defence of their country, and Isaac, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> of the name, was raised from the sanctuary to the throne.
 Unconscious of his danger, the tyrant was absent; withdrawn from the toils of state, in the delicious islands of the Propontis.
 He had contracted an indecent marriage with Alice, or Agnes, daughter of <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> the Seventh, of France, and relict of the unfortunate Alexius; and his society, more suitable to his temper than to his age, was composed of a young wife and a favourite concubine.
 On the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> alarm, he rushed to Constantinople, impatient for the blood of the guilty; but he was astonished by the silence of the palace, the tumult of the city, and the general desertion of mankind.
 <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> proclaimed a free pardon to his subjects; they neither desired, nor would grant, forgiveness; he offered to resign the crown to his son Manuel; but the virtues of the son could not expiate his father's crimes.
 The sea was still open for his retreat; but the news of the revolution had flown along the coast; when fear had ceased, obedience was no more: the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> galley was pursued and taken by an armed brigantine; and the tyrant was dragged to the presence of <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> Angelus, loaded with fetters, and a long chain round his neck.
 His eloquence, and the tears of his female companions, pleaded in vain for his life; but, instead of the decencies of a legal execution, the new monarch abandoned the criminal to the numerous sufferers, whom he had deprived of a father, a husband, or a friend.
 His teeth and hair, an eye and a hand, were torn from him, as a poor compensation for their loss: and a short respite was allowed, that he might feel the bitterness of death.
 Astride on a camel, without any danger of a rescue, he was carried through the city, and the basest of the populace rejoiced to trample on the fallen majesty of their prince.
 After a <CARDINAL>thousand</CARDINAL> blows and outrages, <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> was hung by the feet, between <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> pillars, that supported the statues of a wolf and an a sow; and every hand that could reach the public enemy, inflicted on his body some mark of ingenious or brutal cruelty, till <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> friendly or furious Italians, plunging their swords into his body, released him from all human punishment.
 In this long and painful agony,were the only words that escaped from his mouth.
 Our hatred for the tyrant is lost in pity for the man; nor can we blame his pusillanimous resignation, since a <NORP>Greek</NORP> <NORP>Christian</NORP> was no longer master of his life.
 <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> II.
 Angelus, A.
D 1185, Sept.
 12.
 I have been tempted to expatiate on the extraordinary character and adventures of Andronicus; but I shall here terminate the series of the <NORP>Greek</NORP> emperors since the time of Heraclius.
 The branches that sprang from the <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> trunk had insensibly withered; and the male line was continued only in the posterity of <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> himself, who, in the public confusion, usurped the sovereignty of Trebizond, so obscure in history, and so famous in romance.
 A private citizen of Philadelphia, <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> Angelus, had emerged to wealth and honours, by his marriage with a daughter of the emperor Alexius.
 His son <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> is conspicuous only by his cowardice.
 His grandson <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> punished and succeeded the tyrant; but he was dethroned by his own vices, and the ambition of his brother; and their discord introduced the <NORP>Latins</NORP> to the conquest of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> A.
D.
 1204, April 12.
, the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> great period in the fall of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 If we compute the number and duration of the reigns, it will be found, that a period of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years is filled by <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> emperors, including in the <NORP>Augustan</NORP> list some female sovereigns; and deducting some usurpers who were never acknowledged in the capital, and some princes who did not live to possess their inheritance.
 The average proportion will allow ten years for each emperor, far below the chronological rule of Sir <PERSON>Isaac</PERSON> Newton, who, from the experience of more recent and regular monarchies, has defined about eighteen or <DATE>twenty</DATE> years as the term of an ordinary reign.
 The <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> empire was most tranquil and prosperous when it could acquiesce in hereditary succession; <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> dynasties, the Heraclian, Isaurian, Amorian, Basilian, and <NORP>Comnenian</NORP> families, enjoyed and transmitted the royal patrimony during their respective series of five, four, three, six, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> generations; several princes number the years of their reign with those of their infancy; and <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> the <DATE>Seventh</DATE> and his <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> grandsons occupy the space of an entire century.
 But in the intervals of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> dynasties, the succession is rapid and broken, and the name of a successful candidate is speedily erased by a more fortunate competitor.
 Many were the paths that led to the summit of royalty: the fabric of rebellion was overthrown by the stroke of conspiracy, or undermined by the silent arts of intrigue: the favourites of the soldiers or people, of the senate or clergy, of the women and eunuchs, were alternately clothed with the purple: the means of their elevation were base, and their end was often contemptible or tragic.
 A being of the nature of man, endowed with the same faculties, but with a longer measure of existence, would cast down a smile of pity and contempt on the crimes and follies of human ambition, so eager, in a narrow span, to grasp at a precarious and short lived enjoyment.
 It is thus that the experience of history exalts and enlarges the horizon of our intellectual view.
 In a composition of some days, in a perusal of some hours, <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years have rolled away, and the duration of a life or reign is contracted to a fleeting moment: the grave is ever beside the throne: the success of a criminal is almost instantly followed by the loss of his prize and our immortal reason survives and disdains the <CARDINAL>sixty</CARDINAL> phantoms of kings who have passed before our eyes, and faintly dwell on our remembrance.
 The observation that, in every age and climate, ambition has prevailed with the same commanding energy, may abate the surprise of a philosopher: but while he condemns the vanity, he may search the motive, of this universal desire to obtain and hold the sceptre of dominion.
 To the greater part of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> series, we cannot reasonably ascribe the love of fame and of mankind.
 The virtue alone of <PERSON>John</PERSON> Comnenus was beneficent and pure: the most illustrious of the princes, who proceed or follow that respectable name, have trod with some dexterity and vigour the crooked and bloody paths of a selfish policy: in scrutinizing the imperfect characters of <PERSON>Leo</PERSON> the Isaurian, <PERSON>Basil</PERSON> the First, and <PERSON>Alexius</PERSON> Comnenus, of Theophilus, the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> Basil, and <PERSON>Manuel</PERSON> Comnenus, our esteem and censure are almost equally balanced; and the remainder of the <NORP>Imperial</NORP> crowd could only desire and expect to be forgotten by posterity.
 Was personal happiness the aim and object of their ambition? I shall not descant on the vulgar topics of the misery of kings; but I may surely observe, that their condition, of all others, is the most pregnant with fear, and the least susceptible of hope.
 For these opposite passions, a larger scope was allowed in the revolutions of antiquity, than in the smooth and solid temper of the modern world, which cannot easily repeat either the triumph of <PERSON>Alexander</PERSON> or the fall of Darius.
 But the peculiar infelicity of the <NORP>Byzantine</NORP> princes exposed them to domestic perils, without affording any lively promise of foreign conquest.
 From the pinnacle of greatness, <PERSON>Andronicus</PERSON> was precipitated by a death more cruel and shameful than that of the malefactor; but the most glorious of his predecessors had much more to dread from their subjects than to hope from their enemies.
 The army was licentious without spirit, the nation turbulent without freedom: the <NORP>Barbarians</NORP> of the <LOC>East</LOC> and <LOC>West</LOC> pressed on the monarchy, and the loss of the provinces was terminated by the final servitude of the capital.
 The entire series of <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperors, from the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of the <LOC>Caesars</LOC> to the last of the Constantines, extends above fifteen <CARDINAL>hundred</CARDINAL> years: and the term of dominion, unbroken by foreign conquest, surpasses the measure of the ancient monarchies; the <NORP>Assyrians</NORP> or Medes, the successors of Cyrus, or those of Alexander.
