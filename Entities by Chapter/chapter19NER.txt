<PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> Sole Emperor —Elevation and Death of Gallus—Danger and Elevation of Julian—Sarmatian and <NORP>Persian</NORP> Wars—Victories of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> in <GPE>GaulPower</GPE> of the eunuchs THE divided provinces of the empire were again united by the victory of Constantius; but as that feeble prince was destitute of personal merit either in peace or war; as he feared his generals, and distrusted his ministers; the triumph of his arms served only to establish the reign of the eunuchs over the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
 Those unhappy beings, the ancient production of <NORP>Oriental</NORP> jealousy and despotism,(1) were introduced into <GPE>Greece</GPE> and <GPE>Rome</GPE> by the contagion of <NORP>Asiatic</NORP> luxury.
(2) Their progress was rapid; and the eunuchs, who, in the time of Augustus, had been abhorred, as the monstrous retinue of an <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> queen, (3) were gradually admitted into the families of matrons, of senators, and of the emperors themselves.
 (4) Restrained by the severe edicts of <PERSON>Domitian</PERSON> and Nerva,(5) cherished by the pride of Diocletian, reduced to an humble station by the prudence of Constantine, (6) they multiplied in the palaces of his degenerate sons, and insensibly acquired the knowledge, and at length the direction, of the secret councils of Constantius.
 The aversion and contempt which mankind has so uniformly entertained for that imperfect species appears to have degraded their character, and to have rendered them almost as incapable as they were supposed to be of conceiving any generous sentiment, or of performing any worthy action.
(7) But the eunuchs were skilled in the arts of flattery and intrigue; and they alternately governed the mind of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> by his fears, his indolence, and his vanity.
(8) Whilst he viewed in a deceitful mirror the fair appearance of public prosperity, he supinely permitted them to intercept the complaints of the injured provinces; to accumulate immense treasures by the sale of justice and of honours; to disgrace the most important dignities by the promotion of those who had purchased at their hands the powers of oppression; (9) and to gratify their resentment against the few independent spirits who arrogantly refused to solicit the protection of slaves.
 Of these slaves the most distinguished was the chamberlain Eusebius, who ruled the monarch and the palace with such absolute sway, that Constantius, according to the sarcasm of an impartial historian, possessed some credit with this haughty favourite.
 (10) By his artful suggestions, the emperor was persuaded to subscribe the condemnation of the unfortunate Gallus, and to add a new crime to the long list of unnatural murders which pollute the honour of the house of Constantine.
 Education of <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> When the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> nephews of Constantine, <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> and Julian, were saved from the fury of the soldiers, the former was about twelve, and the latter about six, years of age; and, as the eldest was thought to be of a sickly constitution, they obtained with the less difficulty a precarious and dependent life from the affected pity of Constantius, who was sensible that the execution of these helpless orphans would have been esteemed, by all mankind, an act of the most deliberate cruelty.
(11) Different cities of <GPE>Ionia</GPE> and <GPE>Bithynia</GPE> were assigned for the places of their exile and education; but as soon as their growing years excited the jealousy of the emperor, he judged it more prudent to secure those unhappy youths in the strong castle of Macellum, near Caesarea.
 The treatment which they experienced during a <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> years' confinement was partly such as they could hope from a careful guardian, and partly such as they might dread from a suspicious tyrant.
(12) Their prison was an ancient palace, the residence of the kings of Cappadocia; the situation was pleasant, the building stately, the enclosure spacious.
 They pursued their studies, and practised their exercises, under the tuition of the most skilful masters; and the numerous household appointed to attend, or rather to guard, the nephews of Constantine, was not unworthy of the dignity of their birth.
 But they could not disguise to themselves that they were deprived of fortune, of freedom, and of safety; secluded from the society of all whom they could trust or esteem, and condemned to pass their melancholy hours in the company of slaves devoted to the commands of a tyrant who had already injured them beyond the hope of reconciliation.
 At length, however, the emergencies of the state compelled the emperor, or rather his eunuchs, <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> declared Caesar, A.
D.
 351, March <CARDINAL>5</CARDINAL> to invest Gallus, in the twenty-fifth year of his age, with the title of Caesar, and to cement this political connection by his marriage with the princess Constantina.
 After a formal interview, in which the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes mutually engaged their faith never to undertake anything to the prejudice of each other, they repaired without delay to their respective stations.
 <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> continued his march towards the West, and <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> fixed his residence at Antioch; from whence, with a delegated authority, he administered the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> great dioceses of the eastern praefecture.
(13) In this fortunate change, the new <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> was not unmindful of his brother Julian, who obtained the honours of his rank, the appearances of liberty, and the restitution of an ample patrimony.
(14) Cruelty and impudence of <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> The writers the most indulgent to the memory of Gallus, and even <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> himself, though he wished to cast a veil over the frailties of his brother, are obliged to confess that the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> was incapable of reigning.
 Transported from a prison to a throne, he possessed neither genius nor application, nor docility to compensate for the want of knowledge and experience.
 A temper naturally morose and violent, instead of being corrected, was soured by solitude and adversity; the remembrance of what he had endured disposed him to retaliation rather than to sympathy; and the ungoverned sallies of his rage were often fatal to those who approached his person, or were subject to his power.
(15) Constantina, his wife, is described, not as a woman, but as <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the infernal furies tormented with an insatiate thirst of human blood.
(16) Instead of employing her influence to insinuate the mild counsels of prudence and humanity, she exasperated the fierce passions of her husband; and as she retained the vanity, though she had renounced the gentleness of her sex, a pearl necklace was esteemed an equivalent price for the murder of an innocent and virtuous nobleman.
(17) The cruelty of <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> was sometimes displayed in the undissembled violence of popular or military executions: and was sometimes disguised by the abuse of law and the forms of judicial proceedings.
 The private houses of Antioch, and the palaces of public resort, were besieged by spies and informers; and the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> himself, concealed in a plebeian habit, very frequently condescended to assume that odious character.
 Every apartment of the palace was adorned with the instruments of death and torture, and a general consternation was diffused through the capital of Syria.
 The prince of the East, as if he had been conscious how much he had to fear, and how little he deserved to reign, selected for the objects of his resentment the provincials accused of some imaginary treason, and his own courtiers; whom with more reason he suspected of incensing, by their secret correspondence, the timid and suspicious mind of Constantius.
 But he forgot that he was depriving himself of his only support, the affection of the people; whilst he furnished the malice of his enemies with the arms of truth, and afforded the emperor the fairest pretence of exacting the forfeit of his purple and of his life.
(18) Massacre of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> ministers, A.
D.
 354 As long as the civil war suspended the fate of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> dissembled his knowledge of the weak and cruel administration to which his choice had subjected the East; and the discovery of some assassins, secretly despatched to <GPE>Antioch</GPE> by the tyrant of Gaul, was employed to convince the public that the emperor and the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> were united by the same interest, and pursued by the same enemies.
(19) But when the victory was decided in favour of Constantius, his dependent colleague became less useful and less formidable.
 Every circumstance of his conduct was severely and suspiciously examined, and it was privately resolved either to deprive <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> of the purple, or at least to remove him from the indolent luxury of <LOC>Asia</LOC> to the hardships and dangers of a <NORP>German</NORP> war.
 The death of Theophilus, consular of the provinces of Syria, who in a time of scarcity had been massacred by the people of Antioch, with the connivance and almost at the instigation of Gallus, was justly resented, not only as an act of wanton cruelty, but as a dangerous insult on the supreme majesty of Constantius.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> ministers of illustrious rank, <PERSON>Domitian</PERSON> the <NORP>Oriental</NORP> praefect, and Montius, quaestor of the palace, were empowered by a special commission to visit and reform the state of the East.
 They were instructed to behave towards <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> with moderation and respect, and, by the gentlest arts of persuasion, to engage him to comply with the invitation of his brother and colleague.
 The rashness of the praefect disappointed these prudent measures, and hastened his own ruin as well as that of his enemy.
 On his arrival at Antioch, <PERSON>Domitian</PERSON> passed disdainfully before the gates of the palace; and, alleging a slight pretence of indisposition, continued several days in sullen retirement, to prepare an inflammatory memorial, which he transmitted to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court.
 Yielding at length to the pressing solicitations of Gallus, the praefect condescended to take his seat in council; but his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> step was to signify a concise and haughty mandate, importing that the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> should immediately repair to Italy, and threatening that he himself would punish his delay or hesitation by suspending the usual allowance of his household.
 The nephew and daughter of Constantine, who could ill brook the insolence of a subject, expressed their resentment by instantly delivering <PERSON>Domitian</PERSON> to the custody of a guard.
 The quarrel still admitted of some terms of accommodation.
 They were rendered impracticable by the imprudent behaviour of Montius, a statesman whose art and experience were frequently betrayed by the levity of his disposition.
(20) The quaestor reproached Gallus, in haughty language, that a prince who was scarcely authorised to remove a municipal magistrate should presume to imprison a <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect; convoked a meeting of the civil and military officers, and required them, in the name of their sovereign, to defend the person and dignity of his representatives.
 By this rash declaration of war the impatient temper of <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> was provoked to embrace the most desperate counsels.
 He ordered his guards to stand to their arms, assembled the populace of Antioch, and recommended to their zeal the care of his safety and revenge.
 His commands were too fatally obeyed.
 They rudely seized the praefect and the quaestor, and, tying their legs together with ropes, they dragged them through the streets of the city, inflicted a thousand insults and a thousand wounds on these unhappy victims, and at last precipitated their mangled and lifeless bodies into the stream of the Orontes.
(21) Dangerous situation of <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> After such a deed, whatever might have been the designs of Gallus, it was only in a field of battle that he could assert his innocence with any hope of success.
 But the mind of that prince was formed of an equal mixture of violence and weakness.
 Instead of assuming the title of Augustus, instead of employing in his defence the troops and treasures of the East, he suffered himself to be deceived by the affected tranquillity of Constantius, who, leaving him the vain pageantry of a court, imperceptibly recalled the veteran legions from the provinces of Asia.
 But as it still appeared dangerous to arrest <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> in his capital, the slow and safer arts of dissimulation were practised with success.
 The frequent and pressing epistles of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> were filled with professions of confidence and friendship, exhorting the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> to discharge the duties of his high station, to relieve his colleague from a part of the public cares, and to assist the <LOC>West</LOC> by his presence, his counsels, and his arms.
 After so many reciprocal injuries, <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> had reason to fear and to distrust.
 But he had neglected the opportunities of flight and of resistance; he was seduced by the flattering assurances of the tribune Scudilo, who, under the semblance of a rough soldier, disguised the most artful insinuation; and he depended on the credit of his wife <PERSON>Constantina</PERSON> till the unseasonable death of that princess completed the ruin in which he had been involved by her impetuous passions.
(22) His disgrace and death, A.
D.
 354, <DATE>December</DATE> After a long delay the reluctant <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> set forwards on his journey to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court.
 From <GPE>Antioch</GPE> to <ORG>Hadrianople</ORG> he traversed the wide extent of his dominions with a numerous and stately train; and, as he laboured to conceal his apprehensions from the world, and perhaps from himself, he entertained the people of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> with an exhibition of the games of the circus.
 The progress of the journey might, however, have warned him of the impending danger.
 In all the principal cities he was met by ministers of confidence, commissioned to seize the offices of government, to observe his motions, and to prevent the hasty sallies of his despair.
 The persons despatched to secure the provinces which he left behind passed him with cold salutations or affected disdain; and the troops whose station lay along the public road were studiously removed on his approach, lest they might be tempted to offer their swords for the service of a civil war.
(23) After <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> had been permitted to repose himself a few days at <ORG>Hadrianople</ORG> he received a mandate, expressed in the most haughty and absolute style, that his splendid retinue should halt in that city, while the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> himself, with only <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> post-carriages, should hasten to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> residence at Milan.
 In this rapid journey the profound respect which was due to the brother and colleague of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was insensibly changed into rude familiarity; and Gallus, who discovered in the countenances of the attendants that they already considered themselves as his guards, and might soon be employed as his executioners, began to accuse his fatal rashness, and to recollect with terror and remorse the conduct by which he had provoked his fate.
 The dissimulation which had hitherto been preserved was laid aside at <GPE>Petovio</GPE> in Pannonia.
 He was conducted to a palace in the suburbs, where the general Barbatio, with a select band of soldiers, who could neither be moved by pity nor corrupted by rewards, expected the arrival of his illustrious victim.
 In the close of the evening he was arrested, ignominiously stripped of the ensigns of Caesar, and hurried away to Pola, in Istria, a sequestered prison, which had been so recently polluted with royal blood.
 The horror which he felt was soon increased by the appearance of his implacable enemy the eunuch Eusebius, who, with the assistance of a notary and a tribune, proceeded to interrogate him concerning the administration of the East.
 The <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> sunk under the weight of shame and guilt, confessed all the criminal actions and all the treasonable designs with which he was charged; and, by imputing them to the advice of his wife, exasperated the indignation of Constantius, who reviewed with partial prejudice the minutes of the examination.
 The emperor was easily convinced that his own safety was incompatible with the life of his cousin: the sentence of death was signed, despatched, and executed; and the nephew of Constantine, with his hands tied behind his back, was beheaded in prison, like the vilest malefactor.
 (24) Those who are inclined to palliate the cruelties of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> assert that he soon relented, and endeavoured to recall the bloody mandate; but that the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> messenger, intrusted with the reprieve, was detained by the eunuchs, who dreaded the unforgiving temper of Gallus, and were desirous of reuniting to their empire the wealthy provinces of the East.
(25) The danger and escape of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> Besides the reigning emperor, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> alone survived of all the numerous posterity of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> Chlorus.
 The misfortune of his royal birth involved him in the disgrace of Gallus.
 From his retirement in the happy country of <GPE>Ionia</GPE> he was conveyed, under a strong guard, to the court of Milan, where he languished above <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> months in the continual apprehension of suffering the same ignominious death which was daily inflicted, almost before his eyes, on the friends and adherents of his persecuted family.
 His looks, his gestures, his silence, were scrutinised with malignant curiosity, and he was perpetually assaulted by enemies whom he had never offended, and by arts to which he was a stranger.
 (26) But in the school of adversity <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> insensibly acquired the virtues of firmness and discretion.
 He defended his honour, as well as his life, against the ensnaring subtleties of the eunuchs, who endeavoured to extort some declaration of his sentiments; and whilst he cautiously suppressed his grief and resentment, he nobly disdained to flatter the tyrant by any seeming approbation of his brother's murder.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> most devoutly ascribes his miraculous deliverance to the protection of the gods, who had exempted his innocence from the sentence of destruction pronounced by their justice against the impious house of Constantine.
(27) As the most effectual instrument of their providence, he gratefully acknowledges the steady and generous friendship of the empress Eusebia,(28) a woman of beauty and merit, who, by the ascendant which she had gained over the mind of her husband, counterbalanced in some measure the powerful conspiracy of the eunuchs.
 By the intercession of his patroness <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was admitted into the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> presence: he pleaded his cause with a decent freedom; he was heard with favour; and, notwithstanding the efforts of his enemies, who urged the danger of sparing an avenger of the blood of Gallus, the milder sentiment of <PERSON>Eusebia</PERSON> prevailed in the council.
 But the effects of a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> interview were dreaded by the eunuchs; and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was advised to withdraw for a while into the neighbourhood of Milan, till the emperor thought proper to assign the city of He is sent to Athens, A.
D.
 355, May <GPE>Athens</GPE> for the place of his honourable exile.
 As he had discovered from his earliest youth a propensity, or rather passion, for the language, the manners, the learning, and the religion of the Greeks, he obeyed with pleasure an order so agreeable to his wishes.
 Far from the tumult of arms and the treachery of courts, he spent <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> months amidst the groves of the Academy, in a free intercourse with the philosophers of the age, who studied to cultivate the genius, to encourage the vanity, and to inflame the devotion of their royal pupil.
 Their labours were not unsuccessful; and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> inviolably preserved for <GPE>Athens</GPE> that tender regard which seldom fails to arise in a liberal mind from the recollection of the place where it has discovered and exercised its growing powers.
 The gentleness and affability of manners which his temper suggested and his situation imposed, insensibly engaged the affections of the strangers, as well as citizens, with whom he conversed.
 Some of his fellow-students might perhaps examine his behaviour with an eye of prejudice and aversion; but <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> established in the schools of <GPE>Athens</GPE> a general prepossession in favour of his virtues and talents, which was soon diffused over the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world.
(29) Recalled to Milan, Whilst his hours were passed in studious retirement, the empress, resolute to achieve the generous design which she had undertaken, was not unmindful of the care of his fortune.
 The death of the late <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> had left <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> invested with the sole command, and oppressed by the accumulated weight, of a mighty empire.
 Before the wounds of civil discord could be healed, the provinces of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> were overwhelmed by a deluge of barbarians.
 The <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> no longer respected the barrier of the Danube.
 The impunity of rapine had increased the boldness and numbers of the wild Isaurians; those robbers descended from their craggy mountains to ravage the adjacent country, and had even presumed, though without success, to besiege the important city of Seleucia,.
 which was defended by a garrison of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions.
 Above all, the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch, elated by victory, again threatened the peace of Asia; and the presence of the emperor was indispensably required both in the <LOC>West</LOC> and in the East.
 For the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> sincerely acknowledged that his single strength was unequal to such an extent of care and dominion.
(30) Insensible to the voice of flattery, which assured him that his all-powerful virtue and celestial fortune would still continue to triumph over every obstacle, he listened with complacency to the advice of Eusebia, which gratified his indolence, without offending his suspicious pride.
 As she perceived that the remembrance of <PERSON>Gallus</PERSON> dwelt on the emperor's mind, she artfully turned his attention to the opposite characters of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> brothers, which from their infancy had been compared to those of <PERSON>Domitian</PERSON> and of Titus.
(31) She accustomed her husband to consider <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> as a youth of a mild, unambitious disposition, whose allegiance and gratitude might be secured by the gift of the purple, and who was qualified to fill with.
 honour a subordinate station, without aspiring to dispute the commands or to shade the glories of his sovereign and benefactor, After an obstinate though secret struggle, the opposition of the favourite eunuchs submitted to the ascendancy of the empress; and it was resolved that Julian, after celebrating his nuptials with Helena, sister of Constantius, should be appointed, with the title of Caesar, to reign over the countries beyond the Alps.
(32) Although the order which recalled him to court was probably accompanied by some intimation of his approaching greatness he appeals to the people of <GPE>Athens</GPE> to witness his tears of undissembled sorrow, when he was reluctantly torn away from his beloved retirement.
(33) He trembled for his life, for his fame, and even for his virtue; and his sole confidence was derived from the persuasion that <PERSON>Minerva</PERSON> inspired all his actions, and that he was protected by an invisible guard of angels, whom for that purpose she had borrowed from the Sun and Moon.
 He approached with horror the palace of Milan; nor could the ingenuous youth conceal his indignation when he found himself accosted with false and servile respect by the assassins of his family.
 Eusebia, rejoicing in the success of her benevolent schemes, embraced him with the tenderness of a sister, and endeavoured, by the most soothing caresses, to dispel his terrors and reconcile him to his fortune.
 But the ceremony of shaving his beard, and his awkward demeanour when he <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> exchanged the cloak of a <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> philosopher for the military habit of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> prince, amused during a few days the levity of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court.
(34) The emperors of the age of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> no longer deigned to consult with the senate in the choice of a colleague; but they were anxious that their nomination should be ratified by the consent of the army.
 On this solemn occasion the guards, with the other troops whose stations were in the neighbourhood of Milan, appeared under arms; and <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> ascended his lofty tribunal, holding by the hand his cousin Julian, who entered the same day into the twenty-fifth year of his age.
 (35) In a studied speech, conceived and delivered with dignity, the emperor represented the various dangers which threatened the prosperity of the republic, the necessity of naming a <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> for the administration of the West, and his own intention, if it was agreeable to their wishes, of rewarding with the honours of the purple the promising virtues of the nephew of Constantine.
 The approbation of the soldiers was testified by a respectful murmur: they gazed on the manly countenance of Julian, and observed with pleasure that the fire which sparkled in his eyes was tempered by a modest blush on being thus exposed for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time to the public view of mankind.
 As soon as the ceremony of his investiture had been performed, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> addressed him with the tone of authority which his superior age and station permitted him to assume; and, exhorting the new <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> to deserve, by heroic deeds, that sacred and immortal name, the emperor gave his colleague the strongest assurances of a friendship which should never be impaired by time, nor interrupted by their separation into the most distant climates.
 As soon as the speech was ended, the troops, as a token of applause, clashed their shields against their knees; (36) while the officers who surrounded the tribunal expressed, with decent reserve, their sense of the merits of the representative of Constantius.
 and declared Caesar, A.
D.
 355, Nov.
 6.
 The <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> princes returned to the palace in the same chariot; and, during the slow procession, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> repeated to himself a verse of his favourite Homer, which he might equally apply to his fortune and to his fears.
(37) The <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> and twenty days which the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> spent at <GPE>Milan</GPE> after his investiture, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> months of his <NORP>Gallic</NORP> reign, were devoted to a splendid but severe captivity; nor could the acquisition of honour compensate for the loss of freedom.
(38) His steps were watched, his correspondence was intercepted; and he was obliged, by prudence, to decline the visits of his most intimate friends.
 Of his former domestics <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> only were permitted to attend him - <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> pages, his physician, and his librarian; the last of whom was employed in the care of a valuable collection of books, the gifts of the empress, who studied the inclinations as well as the interest of her friend.
 In the room of these faithful servants an household was formed, such, indeed, as became the dignity of a Caesar; but it was filled with a crowd of slaves, destitute, and perhaps incapable, of any attachment for their new master, to whom, for the most part, they were either unknown or suspected.
 His want of experience might require the assistance of a wise council, but the minute instructions which regulated the service of his table, and the distribution of his hours, were adapted to a youth still under the discipline of his preceptors rather than to the situation of a prince intrusted with the conduct of an important war.
 If he aspired to deserve the esteem of his subjects, he was checked by the fear of displeasing his sovereign; and even the fruits of his marriage-bed were blasted by the jealous artifices of Eusebia(39) herself, who, on this occasion alone, seems to have been unmindful of the tenderness of her sex and the generosity of her character.
 The memory of his father and of his brothers reminded <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> of his own danger, and his apprehensions were increased by the recent and unworthy fate of Sylvanus.
 Fatal end of Sylvanus, A.
D.
 355, September.
 In the summer which preceded his own elevation that general had been chosen to deliver <LOC>Gaul</LOC> from the tyranny of the barbarians; but <PERSON>Sylvanus</PERSON> soon discovered that he had left his most dangerous enemies in the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court.
 A dexterous informer, countenanced by several of the principal ministers, procured from him some recommendatory letters; and, erasing the whole of the contents, except the signature, filled up the vacant parchment with matters of high and treasonable import.
 By the industry and courage of his friends the fraud was, however, detected, and in a great council of the civil and military officers, held in the presence of the emperor himself, the innocence of <PERSON>Sylvanus</PERSON> was publicly acknowledged.
 But the discovery came too late; the report of the calumny, and the hasty seizure of his estate, had already provoked the indignant chief to the rebellion of which he was so unjustly accused.
 He assumed the purple at his headquarters of Cologne, and his active powers appeared to menace <GPE>Italy</GPE> with an invasion and <GPE>Milan</GPE> with a siege.
 In this emergency Ursicinus, a general of equal rank, regained, by an act of treachery, the favour which he had lost by his eminent services in the East.
 Exasperated, as he might speciously allege, by injuries of a similar nature, he hastened with a few followers to join the standard, and to betray the confidence, of his too credulous friend.
 After a reign of only twenty-eight days <PERSON>Sylvanus</PERSON> was assassinated: the soldiers who, without any criminal intention, had blindly followed the example of their leader, immediately returned to their allegiance; and the flatterers of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> celebrated the wisdom and felicity of the monarch who had extinguished a civil war without the hazard of a battle.
(40) <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> visits Rome, A.
D.
 357, April 28.
 The protection of the <NORP>Rhaetian</NORP> frontier, and the persecution of the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church, detained <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> in <GPE>Italy</GPE> above eighteen months after the departure of Julian.
 Before the emperor returned into the <LOC>East</LOC> he indulged his pride and curiosity in a visit to the ancient capital.
(41) He proceeded from <GPE>Milan</GPE> to <GPE>Rome</GPE> along the <NORP>Aemilian</NORP> and <NORP>Flaminian</NORP> ways; and as soon as he approached within <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> miles of the city, the march of a prince who had never vanquished a foreign enemy assumed the appearance of a triumphal procession.
 His splendid train was composed of all the ministers of luxury; but in a time of profound peace he was encompassed by the glittering arms of the numerous squadrons of his guards and cuirassiers.
 Their streaming banners of silk, embossed with gold, and shaped in the form of dragons, waved round the person of the emperor.
 <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> sat alone in a lofty car resplendent with gold and precious gems; and, except when he bowed his head to pass under the gates of the cities, he affected a stately demeanour of inflexible, and, as it might seem, of insensible gravity.
 The severe discipline of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> youth had been introduced by the eunuchs into the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> palace; and such were the habits of patience which they had inculcated, that, during a slow and sultry march, he was never seen to move his hand towards his face, or to turn his eyes either to the right or to the left.
 He was received by the magistrates and senate of Rome; and the emperor surveyed, with attention, the civil honours of the republic and the consular images of the noble families.
 The streets were lined with an innumerable multitude.
 Their repeated acclamations expressed their joy at beholding, after an absence of thirty-two years, the sacred person of their sovereign; and <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> himself expressed, with some pleasantry, his affected surprise that the human race should thus suddenly be collected on the same spot.
 The son of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> was lodged in the ancient palace of Augustus: he presided in the senate, harangued the people from the tribunal which <PERSON>Cicero</PERSON> had so often ascended, assisted with unusual courtesy at the games of the circus, and accepted the crowns of gold, as well as the panegyrics, which had been prepared for this ceremony by the deputies of the principal cities.
 His short visit of thirty days was employed in viewing the monuments of art and power which were scattered over the <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> hills and the interjacent valleys.
 He admired the awful majesty of the Capitol, the vast extent of the baths of <LOC>Caracalla</LOC> and Diocletian, the severe simplicity of the Pantheon, the massy greatness of the amphitheatre of Titus, the elegant architecture of the theatre of <PERSON>Pompey</PERSON> and the Temple of Peace, and, above all, the stately structure of the <WORK_OF_ART>Forum</WORK_OF_ART> and column of Trajan; acknowledging that the voice of fame, so prone to invent and to magnify, had made an inadequate report of the metropolis of the world.
 The traveller who has contemplated the ruins of ancient <GPE>Rome</GPE> may conceive some imperfect idea of the sentiments which they must have inspired when they reared their heads in the splendour of unsullied beauty.
 A new obelisk The satisfaction which <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> had received from this journey excited him to the generous emulation of bestowing on the <NORP>Romans</NORP> some memorial of his own gratitude and munificence.
 His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> idea was to imitate the equestrian and colossal statue which he had seen in the <WORK_OF_ART>Forum</WORK_OF_ART> of Trajan; but, when he had maturely weighed the difficulties of the execution, (42) he chose rather to embellish the capital by the gift of an <NORP>Egyptian</NORP> obelisk.
 In a remote but polished age, which seems to have preceded the invention of alphabetical writing, a great number of these obelisks had been erected, in the cities of <GPE>Thebes</GPE> and Heliopolis, by the ancient sovereigns of Egypt, in a just confidence that the simplicity of their form, and the hardness of their substance, would resist the injuries of time and violence.
 (43) Several of these extraordinary columns had been transported to <GPE>Rome</GPE> by <PERSON>Augustus</PERSON> and his successors as the most durable monuments of their power and victory;(44) but there remained <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> obelisk which, from its size or sanctity, escaped for a long time the rapacious vanity of the conquerors.
 It was designed by <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> to adorn his new city;(45) and, after being removed by his order from the pedestal where it stood before the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis, was floated down the <LOC>Nile</LOC> to Alexandria.
 The death of <PERSON>Constantine</PERSON> suspended the execution of his purpose, and this obelisk was destined by his son to the ancient capital of the empire.
 A vessel of uncommon strength and capaciousness was provided to convey this enormous weight of granite, at least an hundred and fifteen feet in length, from the banks of the <LOC>Nile</LOC> to those of the Tiber.
 The obelisk of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> was landed about <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> miles from the city, and elevated, by the efforts of art and labour, in the great circus of Rome.
(46) The Quadian and <NORP>Sarmatian</NORP> war, A.
D.
 357,358,359.
 The departure of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> from <GPE>Rome</GPE> was hastened by the alarming intelligence of the distress and danger of the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> provinces.
 The distractions of civil war, and the irreparable loss which the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions had sustained in the battle of Mursa, exposed those countries, almost without defence, to the light cavalry of the barbarians; and particularly to the inroads of the Quadi, a fierce and powerful nation, who seem to have exchanged the institutions of <GPE>Germany</GPE> for the arms and military arts of their <NORP>Sarmatian</NORP> allies.
(47) The garrisons of the frontier were insufficient to check their progress; and the indolent monarch was at length compelled to assemble, from the extremities of his dominions, the flower of the <NORP>Palatine</NORP> troops, to take the field in person, and to employ a whole campaign, with the preceding autumn and the ensuing spring, in the serious prosecution of the war.
 The emperor passed the <LOC>Danube</LOC> on a bridge of boats, cut in pieces all that encountered his march, penetrated into the heart of the country of the Quadi, and severely retaliated the calamities which they had inflicted on the <NORP>Roman</NORP> province.
 The dismayed barbarians were soon reduced to sue for peace: they offered the restitution of his captive subjects as an atonement for the past, and the noblest hostages as a pledge of their future conduct.
 The generous courtesy which was shown to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> among their chieftains who implored the clemency of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> encouraged the more timid, or the more obstinate, to imitate their example; and the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> camp was crowded with the princes and ambassadors of the most distant tribes, who occupied the plains of the Lesser Poland, and who might have deemed themselves secure behind the lofty ridge of the Carpathian mountains.
 While <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> gave laws to the barbarians beyond the Danube, he distinguished, with specious compassion, the <NORP>Sarmatian</NORP> exiles, who had been expelled from their native country by the rebellion of their slaves, and who formed a very considerable accession to the power of the Quadi.
 The emperor, embracing a generous but artful system of policy, released the <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> from the bands of this humiliating dependence, and restored them, by a separate treaty, to the dignity of a nation united under the government of a king, the friend and ally of the republic.
 He declared his resolution of asserting the justice of their cause, and of securing the peace of the provinces by the extirpation, or at least the banishment, of the Limigantes, whose manners were still infected with the vices of their servile origin.
 The execution of this design was attended with more difficulty than glory.
 The territory of the <NORP>Limigantes</NORP> was protected against the <NORP>Romans</NORP> by the Danube, against the hostile barbarians by the Theiss.
 The marshy lands which lay between those rivers, and were often covered by their inundations, formed an intricate wilderness, pervious only to the inhabitants, who were acquainted with its secret paths and inaccessible fortresses.
 On the approach of <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> the <NORP>Limigantes</NORP> tried the efficacy of prayers, of fraud, and of arms; but he sternly rejected their supplications, defeated their rude stratagems, and repelled with skill and firmness the efforts of their irregular valour.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of their most war-like tribes, established in a small island towards the conflux of the <NORP>Theiss</NORP> and the Danube, consented to pass the river with the intention of surprising the emperor during the security of an amicable conference.
 They soon became the victims of the perfidy which they meditated.
 Encompassed on every side, trampled down by the cavalry, slaughtered by the swords of the legions, they disdained to ask for mercy; and, with an undaunted countenance, still grasped their weapons in the agonies of death.
 After this victory a considerable body of <NORP>Romans</NORP> was landed on the opposite banks of the Danube; the Taifalae, a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> tribe engaged in the service of the empire, invaded the <NORP>Limigantes</NORP> on the side of the Theiss; and their former masters, the free Sarmatians, animated by hope and revenge, penetrated through the hilly country into the heart of their ancient possessions.
 A general conflagration revealed the huts of the barbarians, which were seated in the depth of the wilderness; and the soldier fought with confidence on marshy ground, which it was dangerous for him to tread.
 In this extremity the bravest of the <NORP>Limigantes</NORP> were resolved to die in arms rather than to yield: but the milder sentiment, enforced by the authority of their elders, at length prevailed; and the suppliant crowd, followed by their wives and children, repaired to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> camp to learn their fate from the mouth of the conqueror.
 After celebrating his own clemency, which was still inclined to pardon their repeated crimes, and to spare the remnant of a guilty nation, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> assigned for the place of their exile a remote country, where they might enjoy a safe and honourable repose.
 The <NORP>Limigantes</NORP> obeyed with reluctance; but before they could reach, at least before they could occupy, their destined habitations, they returned to the banks of the Danube, exaggerating the hardships of their situation, and requesting, with fervent professions of fidelity, that the emperor would grant them an undisturbed settlement within the limits of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces.
 Instead of consulting his own experience of their incurable perfidy, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> listened to his flatterers, who were ready to represent the honour and advantage of accepting a colony of soldiers, at a time when it was much easier to obtain the pecuniary contributions than the military service of the subjects of the empire.
 The <NORP>Limigantes</NORP> were permitted to pass the Danube; and the emperor gave audience to the multitude in a large plain near the! modern city of Buda.
 They surrounded the tribunal, and seemed to hear with respect an oration full of mildness and dignity; when <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the barbarians, casting his shoe into the air, exclaimed with a loud voice, Marha! Marha! a word of defiance, which was received as the signal of the tumult.
 They rushed with fury to seize the person of the emperor; his royal throne and golden couch were pillaged by these rude hands; but the faithful defence of his guards, who died at his feet, allowed him a moment to mount a fleet horse, and to escape from the confusion.
 The disgrace which had been incurred by a treacherous surprise was soon retrieved by the numbers and discipline of the Romans; and the combat was only terminated by the extinction of the name and nation of the Limigantes.
 The free <NORP>Sarmatians</NORP> were reinstated in the possession of their ancient seats; and although <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> distrusted the levity of their character, he entertained some hopes that a sense of gratitude might influence their future conduct.
 He had remarked the lofty stature and obsequious demeanour of Zizais, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the noblest of their chiefs.
 He conferred on him the title of King; and <PERSON>Zizais</PERSON> proved that he was not unworthy to reign, by a sincere and lasting attachment to the interest of his benefactor, who, after this splendid success, received the name of <PERSON>Sarmaticus</PERSON> from the acclamations of his victorious army.
(48) The <NORP>Persian</NORP> negotiation, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>358</CARDINAL> While the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor and the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch, at the distance of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand miles, defended their extreme limits against the barbarians of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and of the Oxus, their intermediate frontier experienced the vicissitudes of a languid war and a precarious truce.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> of the eastern ministers of Constantius, the <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect Musonian, whose abilities were disgraced by the want of truth and integrity, and <NORP>Cassian</NORP> duke of Mesopotamia, a hardy and veteran soldier, opened a secret negotiation with the satrap Tamsapor.
(49) These overtures of peace, translated into the servile and flattering language of Asia, were transmitted to the camp of the Great King, who resolved to signify, by an ambassador, the terms which he was inclined to grant to the suppliant Romans.
 Narses, whom he invested with that character, was honourably received in his passage through <GPE>Antioch</GPE> and Constantinople: he reached <PERSON>Sirmium</PERSON> after a long journey, and, at his <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> audience, respectfully unfolded the silken veil which covered the haughty epistle of his sovereign.
 Sapor, <PERSON>King</PERSON> of Kings, and Brother of the Sun and Moon (such were the lofty titles affected by oriental vanity), expressed his satisfaction that his brother, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> Caesar, had been taught wisdom by adversity.
 As the lawful successor of Darius Hystaspes, <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> asserted that the river Strymon, in Macedonia, was the true and ancient boundary of his empire; declaring, however, that, as an evidence of his moderation, he would content himself with the provinces of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> and Mesopotamia, which had been fraudulently extorted from his ancestors.
 He alleged that, without the restitution of these disputed countries, it was impossible to establish any treaty on a solid and permanent basis; and he arrogantly threatened that, if his ambassador returned in vain, he was prepared to take the field in the spring, and to support the justice of his cause by the strength of his invincible arms.
 Narses, who was endowed with the most polite and amiable manners, endeavoured, as far as was consistent with his duty, to soften the harshness of the message.
 (50) Both the style and substance were maturely weighed in the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> council, and he was dismissed with the following answer: A few days after the departure of Narses, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> ambassadors were sent to the court of Sapor, who was already returned from the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> expedition to his ordinary residence of Ctesiphon.
 A count, a notary, and a sophist, had been selected for this important commission; and Constantius, who was secretly anxious for the conclusion of the peace, entertained some hopes that the dignity of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these ministers, the dexterity of the second, and the rhetoric of the third, (51) would persuade the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch to abate the rigour of his demands.
 But the progress of their negotiation was opposed and defeated by the hostile arts of Antoninus, (52) a <NORP>Roman</NORP> subject of Syria, who had fled from oppression, and was admitted into the councils of Sapor, and even to the royal table, where, according to the custom of the Persians, the most important business was frequently discussed.
(53) The dexterous fugitive promoted his interest by the same conduct which gratified his revenge.
 He incessantly urged the ambition of his new master to embrace the favourable opportunity when the bravest of the <NORP>Palatine</NORP> troops were employed with the emperor in a distant war on the Danube.
 He pressed <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> to invade the exhausted and defenceless provinces of the East, with the numerous armies of Persia, now fortified by the alliance and accession of the fiercest barbarians.
 The ambassadors of <GPE>Rome</GPE> retired without success, and a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> embassy, of a still more honourable rank, was detained in strict confinement, and threatened either with death or exile.
 Invasion of <LOC>Mesopotamia</LOC> by Sapor, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>359</CARDINAL> The military historian, (54) who was himself despatched to observe the army of the Persians, as they were preparing to construct a bridge of boats over the Tigris, beheld from an eminence the plain of Assyria, as far as the edge of the horizon, covered with men, with horses, and with arms.
 <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> appeared in the front, conspicuous by the splendour of his purple.
 On his left hand, the place of honour among the Orientals, Grumbates, king of the Chionites, displayed the stern countenance of an aged and renowned warrior.
 The monarch had reserved a similar place on his right hand for the king of the Albanians, who led his independent tribes from the shores of the Caspian.
 The satraps and generals were distributed according to their several ranks, and the whole army, besides the numerous train of oriental luxury, consisted of more than <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred thousand effective men, inured to fatigue, and selected from the bravest nations of Asia.
 The <NORP>Roman</NORP> deserter, who in some measure guided the councils of Sapor, had prudently advised, that, instead of wasting the summer in tedious and difficult sieges, he should march directly to the Euphrates, and press forwards without delay to seize the feeble and wealthy metropolis of Syria.
 But the <NORP>Persians</NORP> were no sooner advanced into the plains of <LOC>Mesopotamia</LOC> than they discovered that every precaution had been used which could retard their progress or defeat their design.
 The inhabitants with their cattle were secured in places of strength, the green forage throughout the country was set on fire, the fords of the river were fortified by sharp stakes, military engines were planted on the opposite banks, and a seasonable swell of the waters of the <LOC>Euphrates</LOC> deterred the barbarians from attempting the ordinary passage of the bridge of Thapsacus.
 Their skilful guide, changing his plan of operations, then conducted the army by a longer circuit, but through a fertile territory, towards the head of the Euphrates, where the infant river is reduced to a shallow and accessible stream.
 <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> overlooked, with prudent disdain, the strength of Nisibis; but as he passed under the walls of Amida, he resolved to try whether the majesty of his presence would not awe the garrison into immediate submission.
 The sacrilegious insult of a random dart, which glanced against the royal tiara, convinced him of his error; and the indignant monarch listened with impatience to the advice of his ministers, who conjured him not to sacrifice the success of his ambition to the gratification of his resentment.
 The following day <PERSON>Grumbates</PERSON> advanced towards the gates with a select body of troops, and required the instant surrender of the city, as the only atonement which could be accepted for such an act of rashness and insolence.
 His proposals were answered by a general discharge, and his only son, a beautiful and valiant youth, was pierced through the heart by a javelin, shot from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the balistae.
 The funeral of the prince of the <NORP>Chionites</NORP> was celebrated according to the rite of his country; and the grief of his aged father was alleviated by the solemn promise of Sapor, that the guilty city of <GPE>Amida</GPE> should serve as a funeral pile to expiate the death, and to perpetuate the memory, of his son.
 Siege of <GPE>Amida</GPE> The ancient city of <GPE>Amid</GPE> or Amida, (55) which sometimes assumes the provincial appellation of Diarbekir, (56) is advantageously situate in a fertile plain, watered by the natural and artificial channels of the Tigris, of which the least inconsiderable stream bends in a semi-circular form round the eastern part of the city.
 The emperor <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> had recently conferred on <GPE>Amida</GPE> the honour of his own name, and the additional fortifications of strong walls and lofty towers.
 It was provided with an arsenal of military engines, and the ordinary garrison had been reinforced to the amount of <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> legions, when the place was invested by the arms of Sapor.
(57) His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most sanguine hopes depended on the success of a general assault.
 To the several nations which followed his standard their respective posts were assigned; the south to the Vertae; the north to the Albanians; the east to the Chionites, inflamed with grief and indignation; the west to the Segestans, the bravest of his warriors, who covered their front with a formidable line of <NORP>Indian</NORP> elephants.
(58) The Persians, on every side, supported their efforts, and animated their courage; and the monarch himself, careless of his rank and safety, displayed, in the prosecution of the siege, the ardour of a youthful soldier.
 After an obstinate combat the barbarians were repulsed; they incessantly returned to the charge; they were again driven back with a dreadful slaughter, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> rebel legions of Gauls, who had been banished into the East, signalised their undisciplined courage by a nocturnal sally into the heart of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> camp.
 In <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the fiercest of these repeated assaults, <GPE>Amida</GPE> was betrayed by the treachery of a deserter, who indicated to the barbarians a secret and neglected staircase, scooped out of the rock that hangs over the stream of the Tigris.
 <CARDINAL>Seventy</CARDINAL> chosen archers of the royal guard ascended in silence to the <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> story of a lofty tower, which commanded the precipice; they elevated on high the <NORP>Persian</NORP> banner, the signal of confidence to the assailants, and of dismay to the besieged and if this devoted band could have maintained their post a few minutes longer, the reduction of the place might have been purchased by the sacrifice of their lives.
 After <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> had tried, without success, the efficacy of force and of stratagem, he had recourse to the slower but more certain operations of a regular siege in the conduct of which he was instructed by the skill of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> deserters.
 The trenches were opened at a convenient distance, and the troops destined for that service advanced, under the portable cover of strong hurdles, to fill up the ditch, and undermine the foundations of the walls.
 Wooden towers were at the same time constructed, and moved forwards on wheels, till the soldiers, who were provided with every species of missile weapons, could engage almost on level ground with the troops who defended the rampart.
 Every mode of resistance which art could suggest, or courage could execute, was employed in the defence of <NORP>Amidas</NORP> and the works of <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> were more than once destroyed by the fire of the Romans.
 But the resources of a besieged city may be exhausted.
 The <NORP>Persians</NORP> repaired their losses and pushed their approaches; a large breach was made by the battering-ram, and the strength of the garrison, wasted by the sword and by disease, yielded to the fury of the assault.
 The soldiers, the citizens, their wives, their children, all who had not time to escape through the opposite gate, were involved by the conquerors in a promiscuous massacre.
 Siege of Singara, A.
D.
 360 But the ruin of <GPE>Amida</GPE> was the safety of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces.
 As soon as the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> transports of victory had subsided, <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> was at leisure to reflect that to chastise a disobedient city he had lost the flower of his troops and the most favourable season for conquest.
(59) Thirty thousand of his veterans had fallen under the walls of <GPE>Amida</GPE> during the continuance of a siege which lasted seventy-three days; and the disappointed monarch returned to his capital with affected triumph and secret mortification.
 It is more than probable that the inconstancy of his barbarian allies was tempted to relinquish a war in which they had encountered such unexpected difficulties; and that the aged king of the Chionites, satiated with revenge, turned away with horror from a scene of action where he had been deprived of the hope of his family and nation.
 The strength as well as spirit of the army with which <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> took the field in the ensuing spring was no longer equal to the unbounded views of his ambition.
 Instead of aspiring to the conquest of the East, he was obliged to content himself with the reduction of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> fortified cities of Mesopotamia, <GPE>Singara</GPE> and Bezabde; (60) the <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> situate in the midst of a sandy desert, the other in a small peninsula, surrounded almost on every side by the deep and rapid stream of the Tigris.
 <CARDINAL>Five</CARDINAL> <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions, of the diminutive size to which they had been reduced in the age of Constantine, were made prisoners, and sent into remote captivity on the extreme confines of Persia.
 After dismantling the walls of Singara, the conqueror abandoned that solitary and sequestered place; but he carefully restored the fortifications of Bezabde, and fixed in that important post a garrison or colony of veterans, amply supplied with every means of defence, and animated by high sentiments of honour and fidelity.
 Towards the close of the campaign the arms of <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> incurred some disgrace by an unsuccessful enterprise against Virtha, or Tecrit, a strong, or, as it was universally esteemed till the age of Tamerlane, an impregnable fortress of the independent Arabs.
 (61) Conduct of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> The defence of the <LOC>East</LOC> against the arms of <PERSON>Sapor</PERSON> required, and would have exercised, the abilities of the most consummate general; and it seemed fortunate for the state that it was the actual province of the brave Ursicinus, who alone deserved the confidence of the soldiers and people.
 In the hour of danger Ursicinus(62) was removed from his station by the intrigues of the eunuchs; and the military command of the <LOC>East</LOC> was bestowed, by the same influence, on Sabinian, a wealthy and subtle veteran, who had attained the infirmities, without acquiring the experience, of age.
 By a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> order, which issued from the same jealous and inconstant counsels, <PERSON>Ursicinus</PERSON> was again despatched to the frontier of Mesopotamia, and condemned to sustain the labours of a war, the honours of which had been transferred to his unworthy rival.
 <PERSON>Sabinian</PERSON> fixed his indolent station under the walls of Edessa; and while he amused himself with the idle parade of military exercise, and moved to the sound of flutes in the <NORP>Pyrrhic</NORP> dance, the public defence was abandoned to the boldness and diligence of the former general of the East.
 But whenever <PERSON>Ursicinus</PERSON> recommended any vigorous plan of operations; when he proposed, at the head of a light and active army, to wheel round the foot of the mountains, to intercept the convoys of the enemy, to harass the wide extent of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> lines, and to relieve the distress of Amida; the timid and envious commander alleged that he was restrained by his positive orders from endangering the safety of the troops.
 <GPE>Amida</GPE> was at length taken, its bravest defenders, who had escaped the sword of the barbarians, died in the <NORP>Roman</NORP> camp by the hand of the executioner; and <PERSON>Ursicinus</PERSON> himself, after supporting the disgrace of a partial inquiry, was punished for the misconduct of <PERSON>Sabinian</PERSON> by the loss of his military rank.
 But <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> soon experienced the truth of the prediction which honest indignation had extorted from his injured lieutenant, that, as long as such maxims of government were suffered to prevail, the emperor himself would find it no easy task to defend his eastern dominions from the invasion of a foreign enemy.
 When he had subdued or pacified the barbarians of the Danube, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> proceeded by slow marches into the East; and after he had wept over the smoking ruins of Amida, he formed, with a powerful army, the siege of Bezabde.
 The walls were shaken by the reiterated efforts of the most enormous of the battering-rams; the town was reduced to the last extremity; but it was still defended by the patient and intrepid valour of the garrison, till the approach of the rainy season obliged the emperor to raise the siege, and ingloriously to retreat into his <DATE>winter-quarters</DATE> at Antioch.
(63) The pride of Constantius, and the ingenuity of his courtiers, were at a loss to discover any materials for panegyric in the events of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> war; while the glory of his cousin Julian, to whose military command he had intrusted the provinces of <NORP>Gauls</NORP> was proclaimed to the world in the simple and concise narrative of his exploits.
 Invasion of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> by the <NORP>Germans</NORP> In the blind fury of civil discord, <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> had abandoned to the barbarians of <GPE>Germany</GPE> the countries of Gaul, which still acknowledged the authority of his rival.
 A numerous swarm of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> and <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> were invited to cross the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> by presents and promises, by the hopes of spoil, and by a perpetual grant of all the territories which they should be able to subdue.
 (64) But the emperor, who for a temporary service had thus imprudently provoked the rapacious spirit of the barbarians, soon discovered and lamented the difficulty of dismissing these formidable allies, after they had tasted the richness of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> soil.
 Regardless of the nice distinction of loyalty and rebellion, these undisciplined robbers treated as their natural enemies all the subjects of the empire who possessed any property which they were desirous of acquiring.
 <CARDINAL>Forty-five</CARDINAL> flourishing cities, Tongres, Cologne, Treves, Worms, Spires, Strasburg, etc.
, besides a far greater number of towns and villages, were pillaged, and for the most part reduced to ashes.
 The barbarians of Germany, still faithful to the maxims of their ancestors, abhorred the confinement of walls, to which they applied the odious names of prisons and sepulchres; and, fixing their independent habitations on the banks of rivers, the Rhine, the Moselle, and the Meuse, they secured themselves against the danger of a surprise, by a rude and hasty fortification of large trees, which were felled and thrown across the roads.
 The <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> were established in the modern countries of <GPE>Alsace</GPE> and Lorraine; the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> occupied the island of the Batavians, together with an extensive district of Brabant, which was then known by the appellation of Toxandria, (65) and may deserve to be considered as the original seat of their <NORP>Gallic</NORP> monarchy.
(66) From the sources to the mouth of the Rhine, the conquests of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> extended above <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> miles to the west of that river, over a country peopled by colonies of their own name and nation; and the scene of their devastations was <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> times more extensive than that of their conquests.
 At a still greater distance the open towns of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> were deserted, and the inhabitants of the fortified cities, who trusted to their strength and vigilance, were obliged to content themselves with such supplies of corn as they could raise on the vacant land within the enclosure of their walls.
 The diminished legions, destitute of pay and provisions, of arms and discipline, trembled at the approach and even at the name, of the barbarians.
 Conduct of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> Under these melancholy circumstances, an inexperienced youth was appointed to save and to govern the provinces of Gaul, or rather.
 as he expresses it himself, to exhibit the vain image of <ORG>Imperial</ORG> greatness.
 The retired scholastic education of Julian, in which he had been more conversant with books than with arms, with the dead than with the living, left him in profound ignorance of the practical arts of war and government; and when he awkwardly repeated some military exercise which it was necessary for him to learn, he exclaimed with a sigh, "0 Plato, Plato, what a task for a philosopher!" Yet even this speculative philosophy, which men of business are too apt to despise, had filled the mind of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> with the noblest precepts and the most shining examples; had animated him with the love of virtue, the desire of fame, and the contempt of death.
 The habits of temperance recommended in the schools are still more essential in the severe discipline of a camp.
 The simple wants of nature regulated the measure of his food and sleep.
 Rejecting with disdain the delicacies provided for his table, he satisfied his appetite with the coarse and common fare which was allotted to the meanest soldiers.
 During the rigour of a <NORP>Gallic</NORP> <DATE>winter</DATE> he never suffered a fire in his bedchamber; and after a short and interrupted slumber, he frequently rose in the middle of the night from a carpet spread on the floor, to despatch any urgent business, to visit his rounds, or to steal a few moments for the prosecution of his favourite studies.
 (67) The precepts of eloquence, which he had hitherto practised on fancied topics of declamation, were more usefully applied to excite or to assuage the passions of an armed multitude: and although Julian, from his early habits of conversation and literature, was more familiarly acquainted with the beauties of the <LANGUAGE>Greek</LANGUAGE> language, he had attained a competent knowledge of the <LANGUAGE>Latin</LANGUAGE> tongue.
 (68) Since <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was not originally designed for the character of a legislator or a judge, it is probable that the civil jurisprudence of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> had not engaged any considerable share of his attention: but he derived from his philosophic studies an inflexible regard for justice, tempered by a disposition to clemency, the knowledge of the general principles of equity and evidence, and the faculty of patiently investigating the most intricate and tedious questions which could be proposed for his discussion.
 The measures of policy, and the operations of war, must submit to the various accidents of circumstance and character, and the unpractised student will often be perplexed in the application of the most perfect theory.
 But in the acquisition of this important science <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was assisted by the active vigour of his own genius, as well as by the wisdom and experience of Sallust, an officer of rank, who soon conceived a sincere attachment for a prince so worthy of his friendship; and whose incorruptible integrity was adorned by the talent of insinuating the harshest truths without wounding the delicacy of a royal ear.
(69) His <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> campaign in Gaul, A.
D.
 356 Immediately after <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had received the purple at <GPE>Milan</GPE> he was sent into <LOC>Gaul</LOC> with a feeble retinue of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred and sixty soldiers.
 At Vienna, where he passed a painful and anxious winter, in the hands of those ministers to whom <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> had intrusted the direction of his conduct, the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> was informed of the siege and deliverance of Autun.
 That large and ancient city, protected only by a ruined wall and pusillanimous garrison, was saved by the generous resolution of a few veterans, who resumed their arms for the defence of their country.
 In his march from Autun, through the heart of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> provinces, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> embraced with ardour the earliest opportunity of signalising his courage.
 At the head of a small body of archers and heavy cavalry, he preferred the shorter but the more dangerous of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> roads; and sometimes eluding and sometimes resisting the attacks of the barbarians, who were masters of the field, he arrived with honour and safety at the camp near Rheims, where the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops had been ordered to assemble.
 The aspect of their young prince revived the drooping spirit of the soldiers, and they marched from <GPE>Rheims</GPE> in search of the enemy with a confidence which had almost proved fatal to them.
 The Alemanni, familiarised to the knowledge of the country, secretly collected their scattered forces, and, seizing the opportunity of a dark and rainy day, poured with unexpected fury on the rearguard of the Romans.
 Before the inevitable disorder could be remedied, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> legions were destroyed; and <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was taught by experience that caution and vigilance are the most important lessons of the art of war.
 In a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> and more successful action he recovered and established his military fame; but as the agility of the barbarians saved them from the pursuit, his victory was neither bloody nor decisive.
 He advanced, however, to the banks of the Rhine, surveyed the ruins of Cologne, convinced himself of the difficulties of the war, and retreated on the approach of winter, discontented with the court, with his army, and with his own success.
(70) The power of the enemy was yet unbroken; and the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> had no sooner separated his troops, and fixed his own quarters at Sens, in the centre of Gaul, than he was surrounded and besieged by a numerous host of Germans.
 Reduced in this extremity to the resources of his own mind, he displayed a prudent intrepidity which compensated for all the deficiencies of the place and garrison; and the barbarians, at the end of thirty days, were obliged to retire with disappointed rage.
 His <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> campaign, A.
D.
 <CARDINAL>357</CARDINAL> The conscious pride of Julian, who was indebted only to his sword for this signal deliverance, was embittered by the reflection that he was abandoned, betrayed, and perhaps devoted to destruction, by those who were bound to assist him by every tie of honour and fidelity.
 Marcellus, master-general of the cavalry in Gaul, interpreting too strictly the jealous orders of the court, beheld with supine indifference the distress of Julian, and had restrained the troops under his command from marching to the relief of Sens.
 If the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> had dissembled in silence so dangerous an insult, his person and authority would have been exposed to the contempt of the world; and if an action so criminal had been suffered to pass with impunity, the emperor would have confirmed the suspicions which received a very specious colour from this conduct towards the princes of the <PERSON>Flavian</PERSON> family.
 <PERSON>Marcellus</PERSON> was recalled, and gently dismissed from his office.
(71) In his room <PERSON>Severus</PERSON> was appointed general of the cavalry; an experienced soldier, of approved courage and fidelity, who could advise with respect, and execute with zeal; and who submitted, without reluctance, to the supreme command which Julian, by the interest of his patroness Eusebia, at length obtained over the armies of Gaul.
(72) A very judicious plan of operations was adopted for the approaching campaign <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> himself, at the head of the remains of the veteran bands, and of some new levies which he had been permitted to form, boldly penetrated into the centre of the <NORP>German</NORP> cantonments, and carefully re-established the fortifications of Saverne, in an advantageous post which would either check the incursions or intercept the retreat of the enemy.
 At the same time Barbatio, general of the infantry, advanced from <GPE>Milan</GPE> with an army of thirty thousand men, and, passing the mountains, prepared to throw a bridge over the Rhine, in the neighbourhood of Basil.
 It was reasonable to expect that the Alemanni, pressed on either side by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms, would soon be forced to evacuate the provinces of Gaul, and to hasten to the defence of their native country.
 But the hopes of the campaign were defeated by the incapacity, or the envy, or the secret instructions of Barbatio, who acted as if he had been the enemy of the Caesar, and the secret ally of the barbarians.
 The negligence with which he permitted a troop of pillagers freely to pass, and to return, almost before the gates of his camp, may be imputed to his want of abilities; but the treasonable act of burning a number of boats, and a superfluous stock of provisions, which would have been of the most essential service to the army of Gaul, was an evidence of his hostile and criminal intentions.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> despised an enemy who appeared destitute either of power or of inclination to offend them; and the ignominious retreat of <PERSON>Barbatio</PERSON> deprived <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> of the expected support, and left him to extricate himself from a hazardous situation, where he could neither remain with safety, nor retire with honour.
(73) Battle of Strasburgh, A.
D.
 357, <DATE>August</DATE> As soon as they were delivered from the fears of invasion, the <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> prepared to chastise the <NORP>Roman</NORP> youth who presumed to dispute the possession of that country which they claimed as their own by the right of conquest and of treaties.
 They employed <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> days, and as many nights, in transporting over the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> their military powers.
 The fierce Chnodomar, shaking the ponderous javelin which he had victoriously wielded against the brother of Magnentius, led the van of the barbarians, and moderated by his experience the martial ardour which his example inspired.
(74) He was followed by <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> other kings, by <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> princes of regal extraction, by a long train of high-spirited nobles, and by thirty-five thousand of the bravest warriors of the tribes of Germany.
 The confidence derived from the view of their own strength was increased by the intelligence which they received from a deserter, that the Caesar, with a feeble army of thirteen thousand men, occupied a post about one-and-twenty miles from their camp of Strasburg.
 With this inadequate force <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> resolved to seek and to encounter the barbarian host; and the chance of a general action was preferred to the tedious and uncertain operation of separately engaging the dispersed parties of the Alemanni.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> marched in close order, and in <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> columns; the cavalry on the right, the infantry on the left; and the day was so far spent when they appeared in sight of the enemy, that <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> was desirous of deferring the battle till the next morning, and of allowing his troops to recruit their exhausted strength by the necessary refreshments of sleep and food.
 Yielding, however, with some reluctance, to the clamours of the soldiers, and even to the opinion of his council, he exhorted them to justify by their valour the eager impatience which, in case of a defeat, would be universally branded with the epithets of rashness and presumption.
 The trumpets sounded, the military shout was heard through the field, and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies rushed with equal fury to the charge.
 The Caesar, who conducted in person his right wing, depended on the dexterity of his archers and the weight of his cuirassiers.
 But his ranks were instantly broken by an irregular mixture of light-horse and of light-infantry, and he had the mortification of beholding the flight of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred of his: most renowned cuirassiers.
(75) The fugitives were stopped and rallied by the presence and authority of Julian, who, careless of his own safety, threw himself before them, and urging every motive of shame and honour, led them back against the victorious enemy.
 The conflict between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> lines of infantry was obstinate and bloody.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> possessed the superiority of strength and stature, the <NORP>Romans</NORP> that of discipline and temper, and as the barbarians who served under the standard of the empire united the respective advantages of both parties, their strenuous efforts, guided by a skilful leader, at length determined the event of the day.
 The <NORP>Romans</NORP> lost <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> tribunes, and <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred and forty-three soldiers in this memorable battle of Strasburg, so glorious to the Caesar, (76) and so salutary to the afflicted provinces of Gaul.
 Six thousand of the <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> were slain in the field, without including those who were drowned in the Rhine, or transfixed with darts whilst they attempted to swim across the river.
(77) <PERSON>Chnodomar</PERSON> himself was surrounded and taken prisoner, with <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> of his brave companions, who had devoted themselves to follow in life or death the fate of their chieftain.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> received him with military pomp in the council of his officers, and expressing a generous pity for the fallen state, dissembled his inward contempt for the abject humiliation of his captive.
 Instead of exhibiting the vanquished king of the <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> as a grateful spectacle to the cities of Gaul, he respectfully laid at the feet of the emperor this splendid trophy of his victory.
 <PERSON>Chnodomar</PERSON> experienced an honourable treatment: but the impatient barbarian could not long survive his defeat, his confinement, and his exile.
(78) <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> subdues the Franks, A.
D.
 358.
 After <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had repulsed the <NORP>Alemanni</NORP> from the provinces of the Upper Rhine, he turned his arms against the Franks, who were seated nearer to the ocean, on the confines of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> and Germany; and who, from their numbers, and still more from their intrepid valour, had ever been esteemed the most formidable of the barbarians.
(79) Although they were strongly actuated by the allurements of rapine, they professed a disinterested love of war, which they considered as the supreme honour and felicity of human nature; and their minds and bodies were so completely hardened by perpetual action, that, according to the lively expression of an orator, the snows of <DATE>winter</DATE> were as pleasant to them as the flowers of spring.
 In the month of <DATE>December</DATE> which followed the battle of Strasburg, <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> attacked a body of <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> hundred <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> who had thrown themselves into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> castles on the Meuse.
(80) In the midst of that severe season they sustained, with inflexible constancy, a siege of fifty-four days, till at length, exhausted by hunger, and satisfied that the vigilance of the enemy in breaking the ice of the river left them no hopes of escape, the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> consented, for the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> time, to dispense with the ancient law which commanded them to conquer or to die.
 The <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> immediately sent his captives to the court of Constantius, who, accepting them as a valuable present,(81) rejoiced in the opportunity of adding so many heroes to the choicest troops of his domestic guards.
 The obstinate resistance of this handful of <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> apprised <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> of the difficulties of the expedition which he meditated for the ensuing spring against the whole body of the nation.
 His rapid diligence surprised and astonished the active barbarians.
 Ordering his soldiers to provide themselves with biscuit for twenty days, he suddenly pitched his camp near Tongres, while the enemy still supposed him in his <DATE>winter-quarters</DATE> of Paris, expecting the slow arrival of his convoys from Aquitain.
 Without allowing the <PERSON>Franks</PERSON> to unite or to deliberate, he skilfully spread his legions from <GPE>Cologne</GPE> to the ocean; and by the terror, as well as by the success of his arms, soon reduced the suppliant tribes to implore the clemency and to obey the commands of their conqueror.
 The <NORP>Chamavians</NORP> submissively retired to their former habitations beyond the Rhine; but the <NORP>Salians</NORP> were permitted to possess their new establishment of Toxandria, as the subjects and auxiliaries of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
(82) The treaty was ratified by solemn oaths; and perpetual inspectors were appointed to reside among the Franks, with the authority of enforcing the strict observance of the conditions.
 An incident is related, interesting enough in itself, and by no means repugnant to the character of Julian, who ingeniously contrived both the plot and the catastrophe of the tragedy.
 When the <NORP>Chamavians</NORP> sued for peace, he required the son of their king, as the only hostage on whom he could rely.
 A mournful silence, interrupted by tears and groans, declared the sad perplexity of the barbarians; and their aged chief lamented, in pathetic language, that his private loss was now embittered by a sense of the public calamity.
 While the <NORP>Chamavians</NORP> lay prostrate at the foot of his throne, the royal captive, whom they believed to have been slain, unexpectedly appeared before their eyes; and as soon as the tumult of joy was hushed into attention, the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> addressed the assembly in the following terms: — The barbarians withdrew from his presence, impressed with the warmest sentiments of gratitude and admiration.
(83) Makes <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> expiditions beyond the Rhine, A.
D.
 357, 358, 359.
 It was not enough for <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> to have delivered the provinces of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> from the barbarians of Germany.
 He aspired to emulate the glory of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and most illustrious of the emperors; after whose example he composed his own commentaries of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> war.
(84) <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> has related, with conscious pride, the manner in which he twice passed the Rhine.
 <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> could boast that, before he assumed the title of Augustus, he had carried the <NORP>Roman</NORP> eagles beyond that great river in <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> successful expeditions.
 (85) The consternation of the <NORP>Germans</NORP> after the battle of <GPE>Strasburg</GPE> encouraged him to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> attempt; and the reluctance of the troops soon yielded to the persuasive eloquence of a leader who shared the fatigues and dangers which he imposed on the meanest of the soldiers.
 The villages on either side of the Main, which were plentifully stored with corn and cattle, felt the ravages of an invading army.
 The principal houses, constructed with some imitation of <NORP>Roman</NORP> elegance, were consumed by the flames; and the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> boldly advanced about <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> miles, till his progress was stopped by a dark and impenetrable forest, undermined by subterraneous passages, which threatened with secret snares and ambush every step of the assailant.
 The ground was already covered with snow; and Julian, after repairing an ancient castle which had been erected by Trajan, granted a truce of <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> months to the submissive barbarians.
 At the expiration of the truce <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> undertook a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> expedition beyond the Rhine, to humble the pride of <GPE>Surmar</GPE> and Hortaire, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> of the kings of the Alemanni, who had been present at the battle of Strasburg.
 They promised to restore all the <NORP>Roman</NORP> captives who yet remained alive; and as the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> had procured an exact account from the cities and villages of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> of the inhabitants whom they had lost, he detected every attempt to deceive him with a degree of readiness and accuracy which almost established the belief of his super-natural knowledge.
 His <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> expedition was still more splendid and important than the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> former.
 The <NORP>Germans</NORP> had collected their military powers, and moved along the opposite banks of the river, with a design of destroying the bridge, and of preventing the passage of the Romans.
 But this judicious plan of defence was disconcerted by a skilful diversion.
 Three hundred light-armed and active soldiers were detached in <CARDINAL>forty</CARDINAL> small boats, to fall down the stream in silence, and to land at some distance from the posts of the enemy.
 They executed their orders with so much boldness and celerity, that they had almost surprised the barbarian chiefs, who returned in the fearless confidence of intoxication from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of their nocturnal festivals.
 Without repeating the uniform and disgusting tale of slaughter and devastation, it is sufficient to observe that <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> dictated his own conditions of peace to <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> of the haughtiest kings of the Alemanni, <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> of whom were permitted to view the severe discipline and martial pomp of a <NORP>Roman</NORP> camp.
 Followed by twenty thousand captives, whom he had rescued from the chains of the barbarians, the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> repassed the Rhine, after terminating a war the success of which has been compared to the ancient glories of the <NORP>Punic</NORP> and <NORP>Cimbric</NORP> victories.
 Restores the cities of Gaul.
 As soon as the valour and conduct of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had secured an interval of peace, he applied himself to a work more congenial to his humane and philosophic temper.
 The cities of Gaul, which had suffered from the inroads of the barbarians, he diligently repaired; and <CARDINAL>seven</CARDINAL> important posts, between <PERSON>Mentz</PERSON> and the mouth of the Rhine, are particularly mentioned as having been rebuilt and fortified by the order of Julian.
 (86) The vanquished <NORP>Germans</NORP> had submitted to the just but humiliating condition of preparing and conveying the necessary materials.
 The active zeal of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> urged the prosecution of the work; and such was the spirit which he had diffused among the troops, that the auxiliaries themselves, waiving their exemption from any duties of fatigue, contended in the most servile labours with the diligence of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> soldiers.
 It was incumbent on the <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> to provide for the subsistence as well as for the safety of the inhabitants and of the garrisons.
 The desertion of the former, and the mutiny of the latter, must have been the fatal and inevitable consequences of famine.
 The tillage of the provinces of <LOC>Gaul</LOC> had been interrupted by the calamities of war; but the scanty harvests of the continent were supplied, by his paternal care, from the plenty of the adjacent island.
 Six hundred large barques, framed in the forest of the Ardennes, made several voyages to the coast of Britain; and returning from thence, laden with corn, sailed up the Rhine, and distributed their cargoes to the several towns and fortresses along the banks of the river.
 (87) The arms of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had restored a free and secure navigation, which <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> had offered to purchase at the expense of his dignity, and of a tributary present of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand pounds of silver.
 The emperor parsimoniously refused to his soldiers the sums which he granted with a lavish and trembling hand to the barbarians.
 The dexterity, as well as the firmness of Julian, was put to a severe trial, when he took the field with a discontented army, which had already served <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> campaigns without receiving any regular pay or any extraordinary donative.
(88) Civil administration of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> A tender regard for the peace and happiness of his subjects was the ruling principle which directed, or seemed to direct, the administration of Julian.
 (89) He devoted the leisure of his <DATE>winter-quarters</DATE> to the offices of civil government; and affected to assume with more pleasure the character of a magistrate than that of a general.
 Before he took the field he devolved on the provincial governors most of the public and private causes which had been referred to his tribunal; but, on his return, he carefully revised their proceedings, mitigated the rigour of the law, and pronounced a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> judgment on the judges themselves.
 Superior to the last temptation of virtuous minds, an indiscreet and intemperate zeal for justice, he restrained, with calmness and dignity, the warmth of an advocate who prosecuted, for extortion the president of the <NORP>Narbonnese</NORP> province.
 In the general administration of peace and war, the interest of the sovereign is commonly the same as that of his people; but <PERSON>Constantius</PERSON> would have thought himself deeply injured, if the virtues of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> had defrauded him of any part of the tribute which he extorted from an oppressed and exhausted country.
 The prince who was invested with the ensigns of royalty might sometimes presume to correct the rapacious insolence of the inferior agents, to expose their corrupt arts, and to introduce an equal and easier mode of collection.
 But the management of the finances was more safely intrusted to Florentius, <NORP>Praetorian</NORP> praefect of Gaul, an effeminate tyrant, incapable of pity or remorse: and the haughty minister complained of the most decent and gentle opposition, while <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> himself was rather inclined to censure the weakness of his own behaviour.
 The <PERSON>Caesar</PERSON> had rejected with abhorrence a mandate for the levy of an extraordinary tax; a new super-indiction, which the praefect had offered for his signature; and the faithful picture of the public misery, by which he had been obliged to justify his refusal, offended the court of Constantius.
 We may enjoy the pleasure of reading the sentiments of Julian, as he expresses them with warmth and freedom in a letter to <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of his most intimate friends.
 After stating his own conduct, he proceeds in the following terms:— The precarious and dependent situation of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> displayed his virtues and concealed his defects.
 The young hero who supported, in Gaul, the throne of Constantius, was not permitted to reform the vices of the government; but he had courage to alleviate or to pity the distress of the people.
 Unless he had been able o revive the martial spirit of the Romans, or to introduce the arts of industry and refinement among their savage enemies, he could not entertain any rational hopes of securing the public tranquillity, either by the peace or conquest of Germany.
 Yet the victories of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> suspended for a short time the inroads of the barbarians, and delayed the ruin of the Western Empire.
 Description of <GPE>Paris</GPE> His salutary influence restored the cities of Gaul, which had been so long exposed to the evils of civil discord, barbarian war, and domestic tyranny; and the spirit of industry was revived with the hopes of enjoyment.
 Agriculture, manufactures, and commerce again flourished under the protection of the laws; and the curiaea, or civil corporations, were again filled with useful and respectable members: the youth were no longer apprehensive of marriage; and married persons were no longer apprehensive of posterity: the public and private festivals were celebrated with customary pomp; and the frequent and secure intercourse of the provinces displayed the image of national prosperity.
(91) A mind like that of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> must have felt the general happiness of which he was the author; but he viewed with peculiar satisfaction and complacency the city of Paris, the seat of his <DATE>winter</DATE> residence, and the object even of his partial affection.
 (92) That splendid capital, which now embraces an ample territory on either side of the Seine, was originally confined to the small island in the midst of the river, from whence the inhabitants derived a supply of pure and salubrious water.
 The river bathed the foot of the walls; and the town was accessible only by <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> wooden bridges.
 A forest overspread the northern side of the Seine, but on the south; the ground which now bears the name of the <ORG>University</ORG> was insensibly covered with houses, and adorned with a palace and amphitheatre, baths, an aqueduct, and a field of <LOC>Mars</LOC> for the exercise of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops.
 The severity of the climate was tempered by the neighbourhood of the ocean; and with some precautions, which experience had taught, the vine and figtree were successfully cultivated.
 But in remarkable <DATE>winters</DATE> the <LOC>Seine</LOC> was deeply frozen; and the huge pieces of ice that floated down the stream might be compared, by an Asiatic, to the blocks of white marble which were extracted from the quarries of Phrygia.
 The licentiousness and corruption of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> recalled to the memory of <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> the severe and simple manners of his beloved Lutetia,(93) where the amusements of the theatre were unknown or despised.
 He indignantly contrasted the effeminate <NORP>Syrians</NORP> with the brave and honest simplicity of the Gauls, and almost forgave the intemperance which was the only stain of the <NORP>Celtic</NORP> character.
(94) If <PERSON>Julian</PERSON> could now revisit the capital of France, he might converse with men of science and genius, capable of understanding and of instructing a disciple of the Greeks; he might excuse the lively and graceful follies of a nation whose martial spirit has never been enervated by the indulgence of luxury; and he must applaud the perfection of.
 that inestimable art which softens and refines and embellishes the intercourse of social life.
