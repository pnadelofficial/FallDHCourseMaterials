 365, July 21st.
 IN the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> year of the reign of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> and Valens, on the morning of the twenty-first day of July, the greatest part of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> world was shaken by a violent and destructive earthquake.
 The impression was communicated to the waters; the shores of the <LOC>Mediterranean</LOC> were left dry by the sudden retreat of the sea; great quantities of fish were caught with the hand; large vessels were stranded on the mud; and a curious spectator (1) amused his eye, or rather his fancy, by contemplating the various appearance of valleys and mountains which had never, since the formation of the globe, been exposed to the sun.
 But the tide soon returned with the weight of an immense and irresistible deluge, which was severely felt on the coasts of Sicily, of Dalmatia, of Greece, and of Egypt; large boats were transported and lodged on the roofs of houses, or at the distance of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles from the shore; the people, with their habitations, were swept away by the waters, and the city of <GPE>Alexandria</GPE> annually commemorated the fatal day on which fifty thousand persons had lost their lives in the inundation.
 This calamity, the report of which was magnified from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> province to another, astonished and terrified the subjects of Rome, and their affrighted imagination enlarged the real extent of a momentary evil.
 They recollected the preceding earthquakes, which had subverted the cities of <GPE>Palestine</GPE> and Bithynia; they considered these alarming strokes as the prelude only of still more dreadful calamities; and their fearful vanity was disposed to confound the symptoms of a declining empire and a sinking world.
(2) It was the fashion of the times to attribute every remarkable event to the particular will of the Deity; the alterations of nature were connected, by an invisible chain, with the moral and metaphysical opinions of the human mind; and the most sagacious divines could distinguish, according to the colour of their respective prejudices, that the establishment of heresy tended to produce an earthquake, or that a deluge was the inevitable consequence of the progress of sin and error.
 Without presuming to discuss the truth or propriety of these lofty speculations, the historian may content himself with an observation, which seems to be justified by experience, that man has much more to fear from the passions of his fellow-creatures than from the convulsions of the elements.
 (3) The mischievous effects of an earthquake or deluge, a hurricane or the eruption of a volcano, bear a very inconsiderable proportion to the ordinary calamities of war, as they are now moderated by the prudence or humanity of the princes of Europe, who amuse their own leisure and exercise the courage of their subjects in the practice of the military art.
 But the laws and manners of modern nations protect the safety and freedom of the vanquished soldier; and the peaceful citizen has seldom reason to complain that his life or even his fortune is exposed to the rage of war.
 In the disastrous period of the fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, which may justly be dated from the reign of Valens, the happiness and security of each individual were personally attacked, and the arts and labours of ages were rudely defaced by the barbarians of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> and Germany.
 The <NORP>Huns</NORP> and Goths, A.
D.
 376.
 The invasion of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> precipitated on the provinces of the <LOC>West</LOC> the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation, which advanced, in less than forty years, from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the Atlantic, and opened a way, by the success of their arms, to the inroads of so many hostile tribes more savage than themselves.
 The original principle of motion was concealed in the remote countries of the North, and the curious observation of the pastoral life of the Scythians(4) or <NORP>Tartars</NORP> (5) will illustrate the latent cause of these destructive emigrations.
 The pastoral manners of the <NORP>Scythians</NORP> and Tartars.
 The different characters that mark the civilised nations of the globe may be ascribed to the use and the abuse of reason, which so variously shapes and so artificially composes the manners and opinions of an <NORP>European</NORP> or a Chinese.
 But the operation of instinct is more sure and simple than that of reason; it is much easier to ascertain the appetites of a quadruped than the speculations of a philosopher, and the savage tribes of mankind, as they approach nearer to the condition of animals, preserve a stronger resemblance to themselves and to each other.
 The uniform stability of their manners is the natural consequence of the imperfection of their faculties.
 Reduced to a similar situation, their wants, their desires, their enjoyments still continue the same; and the influence of food or climate, which, in a more improved state of society, is suspended or subdued by so many moral causes, most powerfully contributes to form and to maintain the national character of barbarians.
 In every age the immense plains of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> or <ORG>Tartary</ORG> have been inhabited by vagrant tribes of hunters and shepherds, whose indolence refuses to cultivate the earth, and whose restless spirit disdains the confinement of a sedentary life.
 In every age the <NORP>Scythians</NORP> and <NORP>Tartars</NORP> have been renowned for their invincible courage and rapid conquests.
 The thrones of <LOC>Asia</LOC> have been repeatedly overturned by the shepherds of the North, and their arms have spread terror and devastation over the most fertile and warlike countries of Europe.
(6) On this occasion, as well as on many others, the sober historian is forcibly awakened from a pleasing vision, and is compelled, with some reluctance, to confess that the pastoral manners, which have been adorned with the fairest attributes of peace and innocence, are much better adapted to the fierce and cruel habits of a military life.
 To illustrate this observation, I shall now proceed to consider a nation of shepherds and of warriors in the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> important articles of,The narratives of antiquity are justified by the experience of modern times;(7) and the banks of the Borysthenes, of the Volga, or of the <ORG>Selinga</ORG> will indifferently present the same uniform spectacle of similar and native manners.
(8) Diet.
 I.
 The corn, or even the rice, which constitutes the ordinary and wholesome food of a civilised people, can be obtained only by the patient toil of the husbandman.
 Some of the happy savages who dwell between the tropics are plentifully nourished by the liberality of nature, but in the climates of the <LOC>North</LOC> a nation of shepherds is reduced to their flocks and herds.
 The skilful practitioners of the medical art will determine (if they are able to determine) how far the temper of the human mind may be affected by the use of animal or of vegetable food; and whether the common association of carnivorous and cruel deserves to be considered in any other light than that of an innocent, perhaps a salutary, prejudice of humanity.
(9) Yet, if it be true that the sentiment of compassion is imperceptibly weakened by the sight and practice of domestic cruelty, we may observe that the horrid objects which are disguised by the arts of <NORP>European</NORP> refinement are exhibited in their naked and most disgusting simplicity in the tent of a <NORP>Tartarian</NORP> shepherd.
 The ox or the sheep are slaughtered by the same hand from which they were accustomed to receive their daily food; and the bleeding limbs are served, with very little preparation, on the table of their unfeeling murderer.
 In the military profession, and especially in the conduct of a numerous army, the exclusive use of animal food appears to be productive of the most solid advantages.
 Corn is a bulky and perishable commodity, and the large magazines, which are indispensably necessary for the subsistence of our troops, must be slowly transported by the labour of men or horses.
 But the flock and herds which accompany the march of the <NORP>Tartars</NORP> afford a sure and increasing supply of flesh and milk; in the far greater part of the uncultivated waste the vegetation of the grass is quick and luxuriant; and there are few places so extremely barren that the hardy cattle of the <LOC>North</LOC> cannot find some tolerable pasture.
 The supply is multiplied and prolonged by the undistinguishing appetite and patient abstinence of the Tartan.
 They indifferently feed on the flesh of those animals that have been killed for the table or have died of disease.
 Horseflesh, which in every age and country has been proscribed by the civilised nations of <LOC>Europe</LOC> and Asia, they devour with peculiar greediness, and this singular taste facilitates the success of their military operations.
 The active cavalry of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> is always followed, in their most distant and rapid incursions, by an adequate number of spare horses, who may be occasionally used either to redouble the speed or to satisfy the hunger of the barbarians.
 Many are the resources of courage and poverty.
 When the forage round a camp of <NORP>Tartars</NORP> is almost consumed, they slaughter the greatest part of their cattle, and preserve the flesh, either smoked or dried in the sun.
 On the sudden emergency of a hasty march, they provide themselves with a sufficient quantity of little balls of cheese, or rather of hard curd, which they occasionally dissolve in water, and this unsubstantial diet will support, for many days, the life, and even the spirits, of the patient warrior But this extraordinary abstinence, which the <NORP>Stoic</NORP> would approve and the hermit might envy, is commonly succeeded by the most voracious indulgence of appetite.
 The wines of a happier climate are the most grateful present or the most valuable commodity that can be offered to the Tartars; and the only example of their industry seems to consist in the art of extracting from mare's milk a fermented liquor which possesses a very strong power of intoxication.
 Like the animals of prey, the savages both of the old and new world, experience the alternate vicissitudes of famine and plenty, and their stomach is inured to sustain, without much inconvenience, the opposite extremes of hunger and of intemperance.
 Habitations.
 II.
 In the ages of rustic and martial simplicity, a people of soldiers and husbandmen are dispersed over the face of an extensive and cultivated country; and some time must elapse before the warlike youth of <GPE>Greece</GPE> or <GPE>Italy</GPE> could be assembled under the same standard, either to defend their own confines, or to invade the territories of the adjacent tribes.
 The progress of manufactures and commerce insensibly collects a large multitude within the walls of a city; but these citizens are no longer soldiers, and the arts which adorn and improve the state of civil society corrupt the habits of the military life.
 The pastoral manners of the <NORP>Scythians</NORP> seem to unite the different advantages of simplicity and refinement.
 The individuals of the same tribe are constantly assembled, but they are assembled in a camp, and the native spirit of these dauntless shepherds is animated by mutual support and emulation.
 The houses of the <NORP>Tartars</NORP> are no more than small tents, of an oval form which afford a cold and dirty habitation for the promiscuous youth of both sexes.
 The palaces of the rich consist of wooden huts, of such a size that they may be conveniently fixed on large waggons, and drawn by a team perhaps of <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> or thirty oxen.
 The flocks and herds, after grazing all day in the adjacent pastures, retire, on the approach of night, within the protection of the camp.
 The necessity of preventing the most mischievous confusion in such a perpetual concourse of men and animals must gradually introduce, in the distribution, the order, and the guard of the encampment, the rudiments of the military art: As soon as the forage of a certain district is consumed, the tribe, or rather army, of shepherds makes a regular march to some fresh pastures, and thus acquires, in the ordinary occupations of the pastoral life, the practical knowledge of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most important and difficult operations of war.
 The choice of stations is regulated by the difference of the seasons; in the summer the <NORP>Tartars</NORP> advance towards the North, and pitch their tents on the banks of a river, or, at least, in the neighbourhood of a running stream.
 But in the winter they return to the South, and shelter their camp, behind some convenient eminence, against the winds, which are chilled in their passage over the bleak and icy regions of Siberia.
 These manners are admirably adapted to diffuse among the wandering tribes the spirit of emigration and conquest.
 The connection between the people and their territory is of so frail a texture that it may be broken by the slightest accident.
 The camp, and not the soil, is the native country of the genuine Tartar.
 Within the precincts of that camp his family, his companions, his property, are always included, and in the most distant marches he is still surrounded by the objects which are dear or valuable or familiar in his eyes.
 The thirst of rapine, the fear or the resentment of injury, the impatience of servitude, have, in every age, been sufficient causes to urge the tribes of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> boldly to advance into some unknown countries, where they might hope to find a more plentiful subsistence or a less formidable enemy.
 The revolutions of the <LOC>North</LOC> have frequently determined the fate of the South; and in the conflict of hostile nations the victor and the vanquished have alternately drove, and been driven, from the confines of <GPE>China</GPE> to those of Germany.
(10) These great emigrations, which have been sometimes executed with almost incredible diligence, were rendered more easy by the peculiar nature of the climate.
 It is well known that the cold of <ORG>Tartary</ORG> is much more severe than in the midst of the temperate zone might reasonably be expected; this uncommon rigour is attributed to the height of the plains, which rise, especially towards the east, more than half a mile above the level of the sea, and to the quantity of saltpetre with which the soil is deeply impregnated.
 (11) In the winter season, the broad and rapid rivers that discharge their waters into the Euxine, the Caspian, or the Icy Sea, are strongly frozen, the fields are covered with a bed of snow, and the fugitive or victorious tribes may securely traverse, with their families, their waggons, and their cattle, the smooth and hard surface of an immense plain.
 Exercises.
 III.
 The pastoral life, compared with the labours of agriculture and manufactures, is undoubtedly a life of idleness; and as the most honourable shepherds of the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> race devolve on their captives the domestic management of the cattle, their own leisure is seldom disturbed by any servile and assiduous cares.
 But this leisure, instead of being devoted to the soft enjoyments of love and harmony, is usefully spent in the violent and sanguinary exercise of the chase.
 The plains of <ORG>Tartary</ORG> are filled with a strong and serviceable breed of horses, which are easily trained for the purposes of war and hunting.
 The <NORP>Scythians</NORP> of every age have been celebrated as bold and skilful riders, and constant practice had seated them so firmly on horseback that they were supposed by strangers to perform the ordinary duties of civil life, to eat, to drink, and even to sleep, without dismounting from their steeds.
 They excel in the dexterous management of the lance; the long <NORP>Tartar</NORP> bow is drawn with a nervous arm, and the weighty arrow is directed to its object with unerring aim and irresistible force.
 These arrows are often pointed against the harmless animals of the desert, which increase and multiply in the absence of their most formidable enemy—the hare, the goat, the roebuck, the fallow-deer, the stag, the elk, and the antelope.
 The vigour and patience both of the men and horses are continually exercised by the fatigues of the chase, and the plentiful supply of game contributes to the subsistence and even luxury of a <NORP>Tartar</NORP> camp.
 But the exploits of the hunters of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> are not confined to the destruction of timid or innocuous beasts: they boldly encounter the angry wild boar when he turns against his pursuers, excite the sluggish courage of the bear, and provoke the fury of the tiger as he slumbers in the thicket.
 Where there is danger, there may be glory; and the mode of hunting which opens the fairest field to the exertions of valour may justly be considered as the image and as the school of war.
 The general hunting matches, the pride and delight of the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> princes, compose an instructive exercise for their numerous cavalry.
 A circle is drawn, of many miles in circumference, to encompass the game of an extensive district; and the troops that form the circle regularly advance towards a common centre, where the captive animals, surrounded on every side, are abandoned to the darts of the hunters.
 In this march, which frequently continues many days, the cavalry are obliged to climb the hills, to swim the rivers, and to wind through the valleys, without interrupting the prescribed order of their gradual progress.
 They acquire the habit of directing their eye and their steps to a remote object, of preserving their intervals, of suspending or accelerating their pace according to the motions of the troops on their right and left, and of watching and repeating the signals of their leaders.
 Their leaders study in this practical school the most important lesson of the military art, the prompt and accurate judgment of ground, of distance, and of time.
 To employ against a human enemy the same patience and valour, the same skill and discipline, is the only alteration which is required in real war, and the amusements of the chase serve as a prelude to the conquest of an empire.
(12) Government.
 The political society of the ancient <NORP>Germans</NORP> has the appearance of a voluntary alliance of independent warriors.
 The tribes of Scythia, distinguished by the modern appellation of Hords, assume the form of a numerous and increasing family, which, in the course of successive generations, has been propagated from the same original stock.
 The meanest and most ignorant of the <NORP>Tartars</NORP> preserve with conscious pride the inestimable treasure of their genealogy, and whatever distinctions of rank may have been introduced by the unequal distribution of pastoral wealth, they mutually respect themselves and each other as the descendants of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> founder of the tribe.
 The custom, which still prevails, of adopting the bravest and most faithful of the captives, may countenance the very probable suspicion that this extensive consanguinity is, in a great measure, legal and fictitious.
 But the useful prejudice which has obtained the sanction of time and opinion produces the effects of truth; the haughty barbarians yield a cheerful and voluntary obedience to the head of their blood, and their chief, or mursa, as the representative of their great father, exercises the authority of a judge in peace and of a leader in war.
 In the original state of the pastoral world, each of the mursas (if we may continue to use a modern appellation) acted as the independent chief of a large and separate family, and the limits of their peculiar territories were gradually fixed by superior force or mutual consent.
 But the constant operation of various and permanent causes contributed to unite the vagrant <NORP>Hords</NORP> into national communities, under the command of a supreme head.
 The weak were desirous of support, and the strong were ambitious of dominion; the power which is the result of union oppressed and collected the divided forces of the adjacent tribes; and, as the vanquished were freely admitted to share the advantages of victory, the most valiant chiefs hastened to range themselves and their followers under the formidable standard of a confederate nation.
 The most successful of the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> princes assumed the military command, to which he was entitled by the superiority either of merit or of power.
 He was raised to the throne by the acclamations of his equals, and the title of <PERSON>Khan</PERSON> expresses in the language of the <LOC>North</LOC> of <LOC>Asia</LOC> the full extent of the regal dignity.
 The right of hereditary succession was long confined to the blood of the founder of the monarchy; and at this moment all the <NORP>Khans</NORP> who reign from <GPE>Crimea</GPE> to the wall of <GPE>China</GPE> are the lineal descendants of the renowned Zingis.
 (13) But, as it is the indispensable duty of a <NORP>Tartar</NORP> sovereign to lead his warlike subjects into the field, the claims of an infant are often disregarded, and some royal kinsman, distinguished by his age and valour, is intrusted with the sword and sceptre of his predecessor.
 <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> distinct and regular taxes are levied on the tribes to support the dignity of their national monarch and of their peculiar chief, and each of those contributions amounts to the tithe both of their property and of their spoil.
 A <NORP>Tartar</NORP> sovereign enjoys the <ORDINAL>tenth</ORDINAL> part of the wealth of his people; and as his own domestic riches of flocks and herds increase in a much larger proportion, he is able plentifully to maintain the rustic splendour of his court, to reward the most deserving or the most favoured of his followers, and to obtain from the gentle influence of corruption the obedience which might be sometimes refused to the stern mandates of authority.
 The manners of his subjects, accustomed, like himself, to blood and rapine, might excuse in their eyes such partial acts of tyranny as would excite the horror of a civilised people, but the power of a despot has never been acknowledged in the deserts of Scythia.
 The immediate jurisdiction of the <PERSON>Khan</PERSON> is confined within the limits of his own tribe, and the exercise of his royal prerogative has been moderated by the ancient institution of a national council.
 The Coroultai, (14) or Diet, of the <NORP>Tartars</NORP> was regularly held in the spring and autumn in the midst of a plain, where the princes of the reigning family and the mursas of the respective tribes may conveniently assemble on horseback with their martial and numerous trains, and the ambitious monarch who reviewed the strength, must consult the inclination, of an armed people.
 The rudiments of a feudal government may be discovered in the constitution of the <NORP>Scythian</NORP> or <NORP>Tartar</NORP> nations, but the perpetual conflict of those hostile nations has sometimes terminated in the establishment of a powerful and despotic empire.
 The victor, enriched by the tribute and fortified by the arms of dependent kings, has spread his conquests over <LOC>Europe</LOC> or Asia; the successful shepherds of the <LOC>North</LOC> have submitted to the confinement of arts, of laws, and of cities; and the introduction of luxury, after destroying the freedom of the people, has undermined the foundations of the throne.
(15) Situation and extent of Scythia, or Tartary.
 The memory of past events cannot long be reserved in the frequent and remote emigrations of illiterate barbarians.
 The modern <NORP>Tartars</NORP> are ignorant of the conquests of their ancestors;(16) and our knowledge of the history of the <NORP>Scythians</NORP> is derived from their intercourse with the learned and civilised nations of the South—the Greeks, the Persians, and the Chinese.
 The Greeks, who navigated the Euxine, and planted their colonies along the seacoast, made the gradual and imperfect discovery of Scythia, from the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the confines of Thrace, as far as the frozen Maeotis, the seat of eternal winter, and Mount Caucasus, which, in the language of poetry, was described as the utmost boundary of the earth.
 They celebrated, with simple credulity, the virtues of the pastoral life:(17) they entertained a more rational apprehension of the strength and numbers of the warlike barbarians, (18) who contemptuously baffled the immense armament of Darius, the son of Hystaspes.
 (19) The <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarchs had extended their western conquests to the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> and the limits of <NORP>European</NORP> Scythia.
 The eastern provinces of their empire were exposed to the <NORP>Scythians</NORP> of Asia, the wild inhabitants of the plains beyond the <ORG>Oxus</ORG> and the Jaxartes, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> mighty rivers, which direct their course towards the <LOC>Caspian</LOC> Sea.
 The long and memorable quarrel of <GPE>Iran</GPE> and <GPE>Touran</GPE> is still the theme of history or romance: the famous, perhaps the fabulous, valour of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> heroes, <PERSON>Rustan</PERSON> and Asfendiar, was signalised, in the defence of their country, against the <NORP>Afrasiabs</NORP> of the North;(20) and the invincible spirit of the same barbarians resisted, on the same ground, the victorious arms of <PERSON>Cyrus</PERSON> and Alexander.
(21) In the eyes of the <NORP>Greeks</NORP> and Persians, the real geography of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> was bounded, on the east, by the mountains of <LOC>Imaus</LOC> or Caf; and their distant prospect of the extreme and inaccessible parts of <LOC>Asia</LOC> was clouded by ignorance, or perplexed by fiction.
 But those inaccessible regions are the ancient residence of a powerful and civilised nation, (22) which ascends, by a probable tradition, above forty centuries;(23) and which is able to verify a series of near <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> thousand <DATE>years</DATE> by the perpetual testimony of accurate and contemporary historians.
 (24) The annals of <GPE>China</GPE> (25) illustrate the state and revolutions of the pastoral tribes, which may still be distinguished by the vague appellation of <NORP>Scythians</NORP> or Tartars—the vassals, the enemies, and sometimes the conquerors of a great empire, whose policy has uniformly opposed the blind and impetuous valour of the barbarians of the North.
 From the mouth of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the sea of Japan, the whole longitude of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> is about <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and ten degrees, which, in that parallel, are equal to more than five thousand miles.
 The latitude of these extensive deserts cannot be so easily or so accurately measured; but, from the fortieth degree, which touches the wall of China, we may securely advance above a thousand miles to the northward, till our progress is stopped by the excessive cold of Siberia.
 In that dreary climate, instead of the animated picture of a <NORP>Tartar</NORP> camp, the smoke which issues from the earth, or rather from the snow, betrays the subterraneous dwellings of the <NORP>Tongouses</NORP> and the Samoiedes: the want of horses and oxen is imperfectly supplied by the use of reindeer and of large dogs; and the conquerors of the earth insensibly degenerate into a race of deformed and diminutive savages, who tremble at the sound of arms.
(26) Original seat of the <NORP>Huns.
</NORP> The Huns, who under the reign of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> threatened the empire of Rome, had been formidable, in a much earlier period, to the empire of China.
(27) Their ancient, perhaps their original, seat was an extensive, though dry and barren, tract of country immediately on the north side of the great wall.
 Their place is at present occupied by the <CARDINAL>forty-nine</CARDINAL> Hordes or Banners of the Mongous, a pastoral nation, which consists of about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand families.
(28) But the valour of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> had extended the narrow limits of their dominions; and their rustic chiefs, who assumed the appellation of Tanjou, gradually became the conquerors and the sovereigns of a formidable empire.
 Their conquests in Scythia.
 Towards the east their victorious arms were stopped only by the ocean; and the tribes, which are thinly scattered between the <LOC>Amoor</LOC> and the extreme peninsula of Corea, adhered with reluctance to the standard of the <NORP>Huns.
</NORP> On the west, near the head of the Irtish, and in the valleys of Imaus, they found a more ample space, and more numerous enemies.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the lieutenants of the <GPE>Tanjou</GPE> subdued, in a single expedition, <CARDINAL>twenty-six</CARDINAL> nations; the Igours, (29) distinguished above the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> race by the use of letters, were in the number of his vassals; and, by the strange connection of human events, the flight of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of those vagrant tribes recalled the victorious <NORP>Parthians</NORP> from the invasion of Syria.
 (30) On the side of the north, the ocean was assigned as the limit of the power of the <NORP>Huns.
</NORP> Without enemies to resist their progress, or witnesses to contradict their vanity, they might securely achieve a real, or imaginary, conquest of the frozen regions of Siberia.
 The Northern Sea was fixed as the remote boundary of their empire.
 But the name of that sea, on whose shores the patriot <PERSON>Sovou</PERSON> embraced the life of a shepherd and an exile, (31) may be transferred, with much more probability, to the Baikal, a capacious basin, above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred miles in length, which disdains the modest appellation of a lake,(32) and which actually communicates with the seas of the North, by the long course of the Angara, the Tonguska, and the Yenesei.
 The submission of so many distant nations might flatter the pride of the Tanjou; but the valour of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> could be rewarded only by the enjoyment of the wealth and luxury of the empire of the South.
 In the third century before the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era, a wall of fifteen hundred miles in length was constructed, to defend the frontiers of <GPE>China</GPE> against the inroads of the Huns; (33) but this stupendous work, which holds a conspicuous place in the map of the world, has never contributed to the safety of an unwarlike people.
 Their wars with the Chinese, ant.
 Christ.
 201.
 The cavalry of the <GPE>Tanjou</GPE> frequently consisted of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> or <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred thousand men, formidable by the matchless dexterity with which they managed their bows and their horses; by their hardy patience in supporting the inclemency of the weather; and by the incredible speed of their march, which was seldom checked by torrents or precipices, by the deepest rivers, or by the most lofty mountains.
 They spread themselves at once over the face of the country; and their rapid impetuosity surprised, astonished, and disconcerted the grave and elaborate tactics of a <NORP>Chinese</NORP> army.
 The emperor Kaoti, (34) a soldier of fortune, whose personal merit had raised him to the throne, marched against the <NORP>Huns</NORP> with those veteran troops which had been trained in the civil wars of China.
 But he was soon surrounded by the barbarians; and, after a siege of seven days, the monarch, hopeless of relief, was reduced to purchase his deliverance by an ignominious capitulation.
 The successors of Kaoti, whose lives were dedicated to the arts of peace, or the luxury of the palace, submitted to a more permanent disgrace.
 They too hastily confessed the insufficiency of arms and fortifications.
 They were to easily convinced that, while the blazing signal announced on every side the approach of the Huns, the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> troops, who slept with the helmet on their head, and the cuirass on their back, were destroyed by the incessant labour of ineffectual marches.
(35) A regular payment of money and silk was stipulated as the condition of a temporary and precarious peace; and the wretched expedient of disguising a real tribute under the names of a gift or subsidy was practised by the emperors of <GPE>China</GPE> as well as by those of Rome.
 But there still remained a more disgraceful article of tribute, which violated the sacred feelings of humanity and nature.
 The hardships of the savage life, which destroy in their infancy the children who are born with a less healthy and robust constitution, introduce a remarkable disproportion between the numbers of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> sexes.
 The <NORP>Tartars</NORP> are an ugly and even deformed race; and while they consider their own women as the instruments of domestic labour, their desires, or rather their appetites, are directed to the enjoyment of more elegant beauty.
 A select band of the fairest maidens of <GPE>China</GPE> was annually devoted to the rude embraces of the Huns; (36) and the alliance of the haughty <NORP>Tanjous</NORP> was secured by their marriage with the genuine, or adopted, daughters of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> family, which vainly attempted to escape the sacrilegious pollution.
 The situation of these unhappy victims is described in the verses of a <NORP>Chinese</NORP> princess, who laments that she had been condemned by her parents to a distant exile, under a barbarian husband; who complains that sour milk was her only drink, raw flesh her only food, a tent her only palace; and who expresses, in a strain of pathetic simplicity, the natural wish that she were transformed into a bird, to fly back to her dear country, the object of her tender and perpetual regret.
(37) Decline and fall of the Hun.
 The conquest of <GPE>China</GPE> has been twice achieved by the pastoral tribes of the North: the forces of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> were not inferior to those of the Moguls, or of the Mantcheoux; and their ambition might entertain the most sanguine hopes of success.
 But their pride was humbled, and their progress was checked, by the arms and policy of Vouti,(38) the <ORDINAL>fifth</ORDINAL> emperor of the powerful dynasty of the Han.
 In his long reign of fifty-four years, the barbarians of the southern provinces submitted to the laws and manners of China; and the ancient limits of the monarchy were enlarged from the great river of <GPE>Kiang</GPE> to the port of Canton.
 Instead of confining himself to the timid operations of a defensive war, his lieutenants penetrated many hundred miles into the country of the <NORP>Huns.
</NORP> In those boundless deserts, where it is impossible to form magazines, and difficult to transport a sufficient supply of provisions, the armies of <PERSON>Vouti</PERSON> were repeatedly exposed to intolerable hardships: and, of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred and forty thousand soldiers who marched against the barbarians, thirty thousand only returned in safety to the feet of their master.
 These losses, however, were compensated by splendid and decisive success.
 The <NORP>Chinese</NORP> generals improved the superiority which they derived from the temper of their arms, their chariots of war, and the service of their <NORP>Tartar</NORP> auxiliaries.
 The camp of the <GPE>Tanjou</GPE> was surprised in the midst of sleep and intemperance; and, though the monarch of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> bravely cut his way through the ranks of the enemy, he left above fifteen thousand of his subjects on the field of battle.
 Yet this signal victory, which was preceded and followed by many bloody engagements, contributed much less to the destruction of the power of the Huns, Ant.

than the effectual policy which was employed to detach the tributary nations from their obedience.
 Intimidated by the arms, or allured by the promises, of <PERSON>Vouti</PERSON> and his successors, the most considerable tribes, both of the <LOC>East</LOC> and of the West, disclaimed the authority of the Tanjou.
 While some acknowledged themselves the allies or vassals of the empire, they all became the implacable enemies of the Huns: and the numbers of that haughty people, as soon as they were reduced to their native strength, might perhaps have been contained within the walls of <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the great and populous cities of China.
(39) The desertion of his subjects, and the perplexity of a civil war, at length compelled the <GPE>Tanjou</GPE> himself to renounce the dignity of an independent sovereign, and the freedom of a warlike and high-spirited nation.

He was received at Sigan, the capital of the monarchy, by the troops, the mandarins, and the emperor himself, with all the honours that could adorn and disguise the triumph of <NORP>Chinese</NORP> vanity.
 (40) A magnificent palace was prepared for his reception; his place was assigned above all the princes of the royal family; and the patience of the barbarian king was exhausted by the ceremonies of a banquet, which consisted of <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> courses of meat; and of <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> solemn pieces of music.
 But he performed, on his knees, the duty of a respectful homage to the emperor of China; pronounced, in his own name, and in the name of his successors, a perpetual oath of fidelity; and gratefully accepted a seal, which was bestowed as the emblem of his regal dependence.
 After this humiliating submission, the <NORP>Tanjous</NORP> sometimes departed from their allegiance, and seized the favourable moments of war and rapine; but the monarchy of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> gradually declined, till it was broken, by civil dissension, into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hostile and separate kingdoms.

One of the princes of the nation was urged by fear and ambition to retire towards the south with <CARDINAL>eight</CARDINAL> hordes, which composed between forty and fifty thousand families.
 He obtained, with the title of Tanjou, a convenient territory on the verge of the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> provinces; and his constant attachment to the service of the empire was secured by weakness and the desire of revenge.
 From the time of this fatal schism, the <NORP>Huns</NORP> of the north continued to languish about fifty years, till they were oppressed on every side by their foreign and domestic enemies.
 The proud inscription(41) of a column, erected on a lofty mountain, announced to posterity that a <NORP>Chinese</NORP> army had marched seven hundred miles into the heart of their country.
 The Sienpi, (42) a tribe of Oriental Tartars, retaliated the injuries which they had formerly sustained; and the power of the Tanjous, A.

after a reign of thirteen hundred years, was utterly destroyed before the end of the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> century of the <NORP>Christian</NORP> era.
(43) Their emigrations, A.
D.
 100, etc.
 The fate of the vanquished <NORP>Huns</NORP> was diversified by the various influence of character and situation.
(44) Above <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hundred thousand persons, the poorest, indeed, and the most pusillanimous of the people, were contented to remain in their native country, to renounce their peculiar name and origin, and to mingle with the victorious nation of the Sienpi.
 <CARDINAL>Fifty-eight</CARDINAL> hordes, about <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand men, ambitious of a more honourable servitude, retired towards the south, implored the protection of the emperors of China, and were permitted to inhabit and to guard the extreme frontiers of the province of <GPE>Chansi</GPE> and the territory of Ortow.
 But the most warlike and powerful tribes of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> maintained in their adverse fortune the undaunted spirit of their ancestors.
 The <NORP>Western</NORP> world was open to their valour, and they resolved, under the conduct of their hereditary chieftains, to discover and subdue some remote country which was still inaccessible to the arms of the <NORP>Sienpi</NORP> and to the laws of China.
 (45) The course of their emigration soon carried them beyond the mountains of <LOC>Imaus</LOC> and the limits of the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> geography; but we are able to distinguish the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great divisions of these formidable exiles, which directed their march towards the <ORG>Oxus</ORG> and towards the Volga.
 The White <NORP>Huns</NORP> of the Sogdiana.
 The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> of these colonies established their dominion in the fruitful and extensive plains of the Sogdiana, on the eastern side of the Caspian, where they preserved the name of Huns, with the epithet of <NORP>Euthalites</NORP> or Nepthalites.
 Their manners were softened, and even their features were insensibly improved, by the mildness of the climate and their long residence in a flourishing province,(46) which might still retain a faint impression of the arts of Greece.
 (47) The white Huns, a name which they derived from the change of their complexions, soon abandoned the pastoral life of Scythia.
 Gorgo, which, under the appellation of Carizme, has since enjoyed a temporary splendour, was the residence of the king, who exercised a legal authority over an obedient people.
 Their luxury was maintained by the labour of the Sogdians; and the only vestige of their ancient barbarism was the custom which obliged all the companions, perhaps to the number of twenty, who had shared the liberality of a wealthy lord, to be buried alive in the same grave.
(48) The vicinity of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> to the provinces of <GPE>Persia</GPE> involved them in frequent and bloody contests with the power of that monarchy.
 But they respected, in peace, the faith of treaties; in war, the dictates of humanity; and their memorable victory over Peroses, or Firuz, displayed the moderation as well as the valour of the barbarians.
 The <NORP>Huns</NORP> of the Volga.
 The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> division of their countrymen, the <NORP>Huns</NORP> who gradually advanced towards the northwest, were exercised by the hardships of a colder climate and a more laborious march.
 Necessity compelled them to exchange the silks of <GPE>China</GPE> for the furs of Siberia; the imperfect rudiments of civilised life were obliterated; and the native fierceness of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> was exasperated by their intercourse with the savage tribes, who were compared, with some propriety, to the wild beasts of the desert.
 Their independent spirit soon rejected the hereditary succession of the Tanjous; and while each horde was governed by its peculiar mursa, their tumultuary council directed the public measures of the whole nation.
 As late as the thirteenth century their transient residence on the eastern banks of the <LOC>Volga</LOC> was attested by the name of Great Hungary.
(49) In the winter they descended with their flocks and herds towards the mouth of that mighty river; and their summer excursions reached as high as the latitude of Saratoff, or perhaps the conflux of the Kama.
 Such at least were the recent limits of the black Calmucks, (50) who remained about a century under the protection of Russia, and who have since returned to their native seats on the frontiers of the <NORP>Chinese</NORP> empire.
 The march and the return of those wandering Tartars, whose united camp consists of fifty thousand tents or families, illustrate the distant emigrations of the ancient Huns.
(51) Their conquest of the Alani.
 It is impossible to fill the dark interval of time which elapsed after the <NORP>Huns</NORP> of the <LOC>Volga</LOC> were lost in the eyes of the Chinese, and before they showed themselves to those of the Romans.
 There is some reason, however, to apprehend that the same force which had driven them from their native seats still continued to impel their march towards the frontiers of Europe.
 The power of the Sienpi, their implacable enemies, which extended above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand miles from east to west,(52) must have gradually oppressed them by the weight and terror of a formidable neighbourhood; and the flight of the tribes of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> would inevitably tend to increase the strength or to contract the territories of the <NORP>Huns.
</NORP> The harsh and obscure appellations of those tribes would offend the ear, without informing the understanding, of the reader; but I cannot suppress the very natural suspicion that the <NORP>Huns</NORP> of the <LOC>North</LOC> derived a considerable reinforcement from the ruin of the dynasty of the South, which, in the course of the third century, submitted to the dominion of China; that the bravest warriors marched away in search of their free and adventurous countrymen; and that, as they had been divided by prosperity, they were easily reunited by the common hardships of their adverse fortune.
(53) The Huns, with their flocks and herds, their wives and children, their dependents and allies, were transported to the west of the Volga, and they boldly advanced to invade the country of the Alani, a pastoral people, who occupied, or wasted, an extensive tract of the deserts of Scythia.
 The plains between the <LOC>Volga</LOC> and the <GPE>Tanais</GPE> were covered with the tents of the Alani, but their name and manners were diffused over the wide extent of their conquests; and the painted tribes of the <NORP>Agathyrsi</NORP> and <PERSON>Geloni</PERSON> were confounded among their vassals.
 Towards the north they penetrated into the frozen regions of Siberia, among the savages who were accustomed, in their rage or hunger, to the taste of human flesh; and their southern inroads were pushed as far as the confines of <GPE>Persia</GPE> and India.
 The mixture of <NORP>Sarmatic</NORP> and <NORP>German</NORP> blood had contributed to improve the features of the Alani, to whiten their swarthy complexions, and to tinge their hair with a yellowish cast, which is seldom found in the <NORP>Tartar</NORP> race.
 They were less deformed in their persons, less brutish in their manners, than the Huns; but they did not yield to those formidable barbarians in their martial and independent spirit; in the love of freedom, which rejected even the use of domestic slaves; and in the love of arms, which considered war and rapine as the pleasure and the glory of mankind.
 A naked scimitar, fixed in the ground, was the only object of their religious worship; the scalps of their enemies formed the costly trappings of their horses; and they viewed with pity and contempt the pusillanimous warriors who patiently expected the infirmities of age and the tortures of lingering disease.
 (54) On the banks of the <GPE>Tanais</GPE> the military power of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> and the <NORP>Alani</NORP> encountered each other with equal valour, but with unequal success.
 The <NORP>Huns</NORP> prevailed in the bloody contest; the king of the <NORP>Alani</NORP> was slain; and the remains of the vanquished nation were dispersed by the ordinary alternative of flight or submission.
(55) A colony of exiles found a secure refuge in the mountains of Caucasus, between the <NORP>Euxine</NORP> and the Caspian, where they still preserve their name and their independence.
 Another colony advanced, with more intrepid courage, towards the shores of the Baltic; associated themselves with the northern tribes of Germany; and shared the spoil of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces of <GPE>Gaul</GPE> and Spain.
 But the greatest part of the nation of the <NORP>Alani</NORP> embraced the offers of an honourable and advantageous union; and the Huns, who esteemed the valour of their less fortunate enemies, proceeded, with an increase of numbers and confidence, to invade the limits of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> empire.
 Their victories over the Goths, A.
D.
 375.
 The great Hermanric, whose dominions extended from the <LOC>Baltic</LOC> to the Euxine, enjoyed, in the full maturity of age and reputation, the fruit of his victories, when he was alarmed by the formidable approach of an host of unknown enemies,(56) on whom his barbarous subjects might, without injustice, bestow the epithet of barbarians.
 The numbers, the strength, the rapid motions, and the implacable cruelty of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> were felt, and dreaded, and magnified by the astonished Goths, who beheld their fields and villages consumed with flames and deluged with indiscriminate slaughter.
 To these real terrors they added the surprise and abhorrence which were excited by the shrill voice, the uncouth gestures, and the strange deformity of the <NORP>Huns.
</NORP> These savages of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> were compared (and the picture had some resemblance) to the animals who walk very awkwardly on <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> legs, and to the misshapen figures, the Termini, which were often placed on the bridges of antiquity.
 They were distinguished from the rest of the human species by their broad shoulders, flat noses, and small black eyes, deeply buried in the head; and as they were almost destitute of beards, they never enjoyed either the manly graces of youth or the venerable aspect of age.
 (57) A fabulous origin was assigned worthy of their form and manners that the witches of Scythia, who, for their foul and deadly practices, had been driven from society, had copulated in the desert with infernal spirits, and that the <NORP>Huns</NORP> were the offspring of this execrable conjunction.
 (58) The tale, so full of horror and absurdity, was greedily embraced by the credulous hatred of the Goths; but while it gratified their hatred it increased their fear, since the posterity of daemons and witches might be supposed to inherit some share of the preternatural powers as well as of the malignant temper of their parents.
 Against these enemies, <GPE>Hermanric</GPE> prepared to exert the united forces of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> state, but he soon discovered that his vassal tribes, provoked by oppression, were much more inclined to <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> than to repel the invasion of the <NORP>Huns.
</NORP> <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the chiefs of the Roxolani(59) had formerly deserted the standard of Hermanric, and the cruel tyrant had condemned the innocent wife of the traitor to be torn asunder by wild horses.
 The brothers of that unfortunate woman seized the favourable moment of revenge.
 The aged king of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> languished some time after the dangerous wound which he received from their daggers; but the conduct of the war was retarded by his infirmities; and the public councils of the nation were distracted by a spirit of jealousy and discord.
 His death, which has been imputed to his own despair, left the reins of government in the hands of Withimer, who, with the doubtful aid of some <NORP>Scythian</NORP> mercenaries, maintained the unequal contest against the arms of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> and the <NORP>Alani</NORP> till he was defeated and slain in a decisive battle.
 The <PRODUCT>Ostrogoths</PRODUCT> submitted to their fate: and the royal race of the <NORP>Amali</NORP> will hereafter be found among the subjects of the haughty Attila.
 But the person of Witheric, the infant king, was saved by the diligence of <PERSON>Alatheus</PERSON> and Saphrax; <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> warriors of approved valour and fidelity, who, by cautious marches, conducted the independent remains of the nation of the <PRODUCT>Ostrogoths</PRODUCT> towards the Danastus, or Dniester, a considerable river, which now separates the <NORP>Turkish</NORP> dominions from the empire of Russia.
 On the banks of the <PERSON>Dniester</PERSON> the prudent Athanaric, more attentive to his own than to the general safety, had fixed the camp of the Visigoths; with the firm resolution of opposing the victorious barbarians, whom he thought it less advisable to provoke.
 The ordinary speed of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> was checked by the weight of baggage and the encumbrance of captives; but their military skill deceived and almost destroyed the army of Athanaric.
 While the Judge of the <PRODUCT>Visigoths</PRODUCT> defended the banks of the <PERSON>Dniester</PERSON> he was encompassed and attacked by a numerous detachment of cavalry, who, by the light of the moon, had passed the river in a fordable place; and it was not without the utmost efforts of courage and conduct that he was able to effect his retreat towards the hilly country.
 The undaunted general had already formed a new and judicious plan of defensive war; and the strong lines which he was preparing to construct between the mountains, the Pruth, and the Danube, would have secured the extensive and fertile territory that bears the modern name of <GPE>Wallachia</GPE> from the destructive inroads of the <NORP>Huns.
</NORP> (60) But the hopes and measures of the Judge of the <PRODUCT>Visigoths</PRODUCT> were soon disappointed by the trembling impatience of his dismayed countrymen, who were persuaded by their fears that the interposition of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> was the only barrier that could save them from the rapid pursuit and invincible valour of the barbarians of Scythia.
 Under the command of <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> and Alavivus,(61) the body of the nation hastily advanced to the banks of the great river and implored the protection of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor of the East.
 <PERSON>Athanaric</PERSON> himself, still anxious to avoid the guilt of perjury, retired, with a band of faithful followers, into the mountainous country of Caucaland, which appears to have been guarded and almost concealed by the impenetrable forests of Transylvania.
(62) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> implore the protection of Valens, A.
D.
 376.
 After <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> had terminated the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war with some appearance of glory and success, he made a progress through his dominions of Asia, and at length fixed his residence in the capital of Syria.
 The five years(63) which he spent at <GPE>Antioch</GPE> were employed to watch, from a secure distance, the hostile designs of the <NORP>Persian</NORP> monarch; to check the depredations of the <NORP>Saracens</NORP> and Isaurians;(64) to enforce, by arguments more prevalent than those of reason and eloquence, the belief of the <NORP>Arian</NORP> theology, and to satisfy his anxious suspicions by the promiscuous execution of the innocent and the guilty.
 But the attention of the emperor was most seriously engaged by the important intelligence which he received from the civil and military officers who were intrusted with the defence of the Danube.
 He was informed that the <LOC>North</LOC> was agitated by a furious tempest; that the irruption of the Huns, an unknown and monstrous race of savages, had subverted the power of the Goths; and that the suppliant multitudes of that warlike nation, whose pride was now humbled in the dust, covered a space many miles along the banks of the river.
 With outstretched arms and pathetic lamentations they loudly deplored their past misfortunes and their present danger; acknowledged that their only hope of safety was in the clemency of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> government; and most solemnly protested that, if the gracious liberality of the emperor would permit them to cultivate the waste lands of Thrace, they should ever hold themselves bound, by the strongest obligations of duty and gratitude, to obey the laws and to guard the limits of the republic.
 These assurances were confirmed by the ambassadors of the Goths, who impatiently expected from the mouth of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> an answer that must finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen.
 The emperor of the <LOC>East</LOC> was no longer guided by the wisdom and authority of his elder brother, A.
D.
 375, Nov 17.
whose death happened towards the end of the preceding year; and as the distressful situation of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> required an instant and peremptory decision, he was deprived of the favourite resource of feeble and timid minds, who consider the use of the dilatory and ambiguous measures as the most admirable efforts of consummate prudence.
 As long as the same passions and interests subsist among mankind, the questions of war and peace, of justice and policy, which were debated in the councils of antiquity, will frequently present themselves as the subject of modern deliberation.
 But the most experienced statesman of <LOC>Europe</LOC> has never been summoned to consider the propriety or the danger of admitting or rejecting an innumerable multitude of barbarians, who are driven by despair and hunger to solicit a settlement on the territories of a civilised nation.
 When that important proposition, so essentially connected with the public safety, was referred to the ministers of Valens, they were perplexed and divided; but they soon acquiesced in the flattering sentiment which seemed the most favourable to the pride, the indolence, and the avarice of their sovereign.
 The slaves, who were decorated with the titles of praefects and generals, dissembled or disregarded the terrors of this national emigration—so extremely different from the partial and accidental colonies which had been received on the extreme limits of the empire.
 But they applauded the liberality of fortune which had conducted, from the most distant countries of the globe, a numerous and invincible army of strangers to defend the throne of Valens, who might now add to the royal treasures the immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to compensate their annual proportion of recruits.
 The prayers of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were granted, and their service was accepted by the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court; and orders were immediately despatched by the civil and military governors of the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> diocese to make the necessary preparations or the passage and subsistence of a great people, till a proper and sufficient territory could be allotted for their future residence.
 The liberality of the emperor was accompanied, however, with <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> harsh and rigorous conditions, which prudence might justify on the side of the Romans, but which distress alone could extort from the indignant Goths.
 Before they passed the <LOC>Danube</LOC> they were required to deliver their arms, and it was insisted that their children should be taken from them and dispersed through the provinces of Asia, where they might be civilised by the arts of education, and serve as hostages to secure the fidelity of their parents.
 They are transported over the <LOC>Danube</LOC> into the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 During this suspense of a doubtful and distant negotiation, the impatient <NORP>Goths</NORP> made some rash attempts to pass the <LOC>Danube</LOC> without the permission of the government whose protection they had implored.
 Their motions were strictly observed by the vigilance of the troops which were stationed along the river, and their foremost detachments were defeated with considerable slaughter; yet such were the timid councils of the reign of Valens, that the brave officers who had served their country in the execution of their duty were punished by the loss of their employments, and narrowly escaped the loss of their heads.
 The <ORG>Imperial</ORG> mandate was at length received for transporting over the <LOC>Danube</LOC> the whole body of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation; (65) but the execution of this order was a task of labour and difficulty.
 The stream of the Danube, which in those parts is above a mile broad,(66) had been swelled by incessant rains, and in this tumultuous passage many were swept away and drowned by the rapid violence of the current.
 A large fleet of vessels, of boats, and of canoes, was provided; many days and nights they passed and repassed with indefatigable toil; and the most strenuous diligence was exerted by the officers of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> that not a single barbarian, of those who were reserved to subvert the foundations of Rome, should be left on the opposite shore.
 It was thought expedient that an accurate account should be taken of their numbers; but the persons who were employed soon desisted, with amazement and dismay, from the prosecution of the endless and impracticable task;(67) and the principal historian of the age most seriously affirms that the prodigious armies of <PERSON>Darius</PERSON> and Xerxes, which had so long been considered as the fables of vain and credulous antiquity, were now justified, in the eyes of mankind, by the evidence of fact and experience.
 A probable testimony has fixed the number of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> warriors at <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> hundred thousand men; and if we can venture to add the just proportion of women, of children, and of slaves, the whole mass of people which composed this formidable emigration must have amounted to near a million of persons, of both sexes and of al! ages.
 The children of the Goths, those at least of a distinguished rank, were separated from the multitude.
 They were conducted without delay to the distant seats assigned for their residence and education; and as the numerous train of hostages or captives passed through the cities, their gay and splendid apparel, their robust and martial figure, excited the surprise and envy of the provincials.
 But the stipulation, the most offensive to the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and the most important to the Romans, was shamefully eluded.
 The barbarians, who considered their arms as the ensigns of honour and the pledges of safety, were disposed to offer a price which the lust or avarice of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> officers was easily tempted to accept.
 To preserve their arms, the haughty warriors consented, with some reluctance, to prostitute their wives or their daughters; the charms of a beauteous maid, or a comely boy, secured the.
 connivance of the inspectors, who sometimes cast an eye of covetousness on the fringed carpets and linen garments of their new allies, (68) or who sacrificed their duty to the mean consideration of filling their farms with cattle and their houses with slaves.
 The Goths, with arms in their hands, were permitted to enter the boats; and when their strength was collected on the other side of the river, the immense camp which was spread over the plains and the hills of the Lower <GPE>Maesia</GPE> assumed a threatening and even hostile aspect.
 The leaders of the Ostrogoths, <PERSON>Alatheus</PERSON> and Saphrax, the guardians of their infant king, appeared soon afterwards on the northern banks of the Danube, and immediately despatched their ambassadors to the court of <GPE>Antioch</GPE> to solicit, with the same professions of allegiance and gratitude, the same favour which had been granted to the suppliant Visigoths.
 The absolute refusal of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> suspended their progress, and discovered the repentance, the suspicions, and the fears of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> council.
 Their distress and discontent.
 An undisciplined and unsettled nation of barbarians required the firmest temper and the most dexterous management.
 The daily subsistence of near a million of extraordinary subjects could be supplied only by constant and skilful diligence, and might continually be interrupted by mistake or accident.
 The insolence or the indignation of the Goths, if they conceived themselves to be the objects either of fear or of contempt, might urge them to the most desperate extremities, and the fortune of the state seemed to depend on the prudence, as well as the integrity, of the generals of Valens.
 At this important crisis the military government of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> was exercised by <PERSON>Lupicinus</PERSON> and Maximus, in whose venal minds the slightest hope of private emolument outweighed every consideration of public advantage, and whose guilt was only alleviated by their incapacity of discerning the pernicious effects of their rash and criminal administration.
 Instead of obeying the orders of their sovereign, and satisfying, with decent liberality, the demands of the Goths, they levied an ungenerous and oppressive tax on the wants of the hungry barbarians.
 The vilest food was sold at an extravagant price, and, in the room of wholesome and substantial provisions, the markets were filled with the flesh of dogs and of unclean animals who had died of disease.
 To obtain the valuable acquisition of a pound of bread, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> resigned the possession of an expensive though serviceable slave, and a small quantity of meat was greedily purchased with ten pounds of a precious but useless metal.
 (69) When their property was exhausted, they continued this necessary traffic by the sale of their sons and daughters; and notwithstanding the love of freedom which animated every <NORP>Gothic</NORP> breast, they submitted to the humiliating maxim that it was better for their children to be maintained in a servile condition than to perish in a state of wretched and helpless independence.
 The most lively resentment is excited by the tyranny of pretended benefactors, who sternly exact the debt of gratitude which they have cancelled by subsequent injuries; a spirit of discontent insensibly arose in the camp of the barbarians, who pleaded, without success, the merit of their patient and dutiful behaviour, and loudly complained of the inhospitable treatment which they had received from their new allies.
 They beheld around them the wealth and plenty of a fertile province, in the midst of which they suffered the intolerable hardships of artificial famine.
 But the means of relief, and even of revenge, were in their hands, since the rapaciousness of their tyrants had left to an injured people the possession and the use of arms.
 The clamours of a multitude, untaught to disguise their sentiments, announced the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> symptoms of resistance, and alarmed the timid and guilty minds of <PERSON>Lupicinus</PERSON> and Maximus.
 Those crafty ministers, who substituted the cunning of temporary expedients to the wise and salutary counsels of general policy, attempted to remove the <NORP>Goths</NORP> from their dangerous station on the frontiers of the empire, and to disperse them, in separate quarters of cantonment, through the interior provinces.
 As they were conscious how ill they had deserved the respect or confidence of the barbarians, they diligently collected from every side a military force that might urge the tardy and reluctant march of a people who had not yet renounced the title or the duties of <NORP>Roman</NORP> subjects But the generals of Valens, while their attention was solely directed to the discontented Visigoths, imprudently disarmed the ships and the fortifications which constituted the defence of the Danube.
 The fatal oversight, as observed and improved by <PERSON>Alatheus</PERSON> and Saphrax, who anxiously watched the favourable moment of escaping from the pursuit of the <NORP>Huns.
</NORP> By the help of such rafts and vessels as could be hastily procured, the leaders of the <PRODUCT>Ostrogoths</PRODUCT> transported, without opposition, their king and their army, and boldly fixed an hostile and independent camp on the territories of the empire.
(70) Revolt of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in Maesia, and their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> victories.
 Under the name of Judges, <PERSON>Alavivus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> were the leaders of the <PRODUCT>Visigoths</PRODUCT> in peace and war; and the authority which they derived from their birth was ratified by the free consent of the nation.
 In a season of tranquillity their power might have been equal as well as their rank; but, as soon as their countrymen were exasperated by hunger and oppression, the superior abilities of <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> assumed the military command, which he was qualified to exercise for the public welfare.
 He restrained the impatient spirit of the <PRODUCT>Visigoths</PRODUCT> till the injuries and the insults of their tyrants should justify their resistance in the opinion of mankind: but he was not disposed to sacrifice any solid advantages for the empty praise of justice and moderation.
 Sensible of the benefits which would result from the union of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> powers under the same standard, he secretly cultivated the friendship of the Ostrogoths; and while he professed an implicit obedience to the orders of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> generals, he proceeded by slow marches towards Marcianopolis, the capital of the Lower Maesia, about seventy miles from the banks of the Danube.
 On that fatal spot the flames of discord and mutual hatred burst forth into a dreadful conflagration.
 <PERSON>Lupicinus</PERSON> had invited the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> chiefs to a splendid entertainment, and their martial train remained under arms at the entrance of the palace.
 But the gates of the city were strictly guarded, and the barbarians were sternly excluded from the use of a plentiful market, to which they asserted their equal claim of subjects and allies.
 Their humble prayers were rejected with insolence and derision, and as their patience was now exhausted, the townsmen, the soldiers, and the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were soon involved in a conflict of passionate altercation and angry reproaches.
 A blow was imprudently given; a sword was hastily drawn, and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> blood that was spilt in this accidental quarrel became the signal of a long and destructive war.
 In the midst of noise and brutal intemperance <PERSON>Lupicinus</PERSON> was informed by a secret messenger that many of his soldiers were slain and despoiled of their arms; and as he was already inflamed by wine and oppressed by sleep, he issued a rash command, that their death should be revenged by the massacre of the guards of <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> and Alavivus.
 The clamorous shouts and dying groans apprised <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> of his extreme danger; and, as he possessed the calm and intrepid spirit of a hero, he saw that he was lost if he allowed a moment of deliberation to the man who had so deeply injured him.
 At these words <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> and his companions drew their swords, opened their passage through the unresisting crowd, which filled the palace, the streets, and the gates of Marcianopolis, and, mounting their horses, hastily vanished from the eyes of the astonished Romans.
 The generals of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were saluted by the fierce and joyful acclamations of the camp; war was instantly resolved, and the resolution was executed without delay: the banners of the nation were displayed according to the custom of their ancestors; and the air resounded with the harsh and mournful music of the barbarian trumpet.
(71) The weak and guilty Lupicinus, who had dared to provoke, who had neglected to destroy, and who still presumed to despise his formidable enemy, marched against the Goths, at the head of such a military force as could be collected on this sudden emergency.
 The barbarians expected his approach about <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> miles from Marcianopolis; and on this occasion the talents of the general were found to be of more prevailing efficacy than the weapons and discipline of the troops.
 The valour of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was so ably directed by the genius of Fritigern, that they broke, by a close and vigorous attack, the ranks of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> legions.
 <PERSON>Lupicinus</PERSON> left his arms and standards, his tribunes and his bravest soldiers, on the field of battle; and their useless courage served only to protect the ignominious flight of their leader.
 Such are the words of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> historian,(72) who celebrates, with rude eloquence, the glory of his countrymen.
 But the dominion of the barbarians was exercised only for the purposes of rapine and destruction.
 They penetrate into Thrace.
 As they had been deprived by the ministers of the emperor of the common benefits of nature and the fair intercourse of social life, they retaliated the injustice on the subjects of the empire; and the crimes of <PERSON>Lupicinus</PERSON> were expiated by the ruin of the peaceful husbandmen of Thrace, the conflagration of their villages, and the massacre or captivity of their innocent families.
 The report of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> victory was soon diffused over the adjacent country; and while it filled the minds of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> with terror and dismay, their own hasty imprudence contributed to increase the forces of <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> and the calamities of the province.
 Some time before the great emigration a numerous body of Goths, under the command of <PERSON>Suerid</PERSON> and Colias, had been received into the protection and service of the empire.
(73) They were encamped under the walls of Hadrianople: but the ministers of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> were anxious to remove them beyond the Hellespont, at a distance from the dangerous temptation which might so easily be communicated by the neighbourhood and the success of their countrymen.
 The respectful submission with which they yielded to the order of their march might be considered as a proof of their fidelity; and their moderate request of a sufficient allowance of provisions and of a delay of only <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> days was expressed in the most dutiful terms.
 But the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> magistrate of Hadrianople, incensed by some disorders which had been committed at his country-house, refused this indulgence; and arming against them the inhabitants and manufacturers of a populous city, he urged, with hostile threats, their instant departure.
 The barbarians stood silent and amazed, till they were exasperated by the insulting clamours and missile weapons of the populace: but when patience or contempt was fatigued, they crushed the undisciplined multitude, inflicted many a shameful wound on the backs of their flying enemies, and despoiled them of the splendid armour(74) which they were unworthy to bear.
 The resemblance of their sufferings and their actions soon united this victorious detachment to the nation of the Visigoths; the troops of <NORP>Colias</NORP> and <PERSON>Suerid</PERSON> expected the approach of the great Fritigern, ranged themselves under his standard, and signalised their ardour in the siege of Hadrianople.
 But the resistance of the garrison informed the barbarians that in the attack of regular fortifications the efforts of unskilful courage are seldom effectual.
 Their general acknowledged his error, raised the siege, declared that "he was at peace with stone walls," (75) and revenged his disappointment on the adjacent country.
 He accepted with pleasure the useful reinforcement of hardy workmen who laboured in the goldmines of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> (76) for the emolument and under the lash of an unfeeling master: (77) and these new associates conducted the barbarians through the secret paths to the most sequestered places, which had been chosen to secure the inhabitants, the cattle, and the magazines of corn.
 With the assistance of such guides nothing could remain impervious or inaccessible: resistance was fatal; flight was impracticable; and the patient submission of helpless innocence seldom found mercy from the barbarian conqueror.
 In the course of these depredations a great number of the children of the Goths, who had been sold into captivity, were restored to the embraces of their afflicted parents; but these tender interviews, which might have revived and cherished in their minds some sentiments of humanity, tended only to stimulate their native fierceness by the desire of revenge.
 They listened with eager attention to the complaints of their captive children, who had suffered the most cruel indignities from the lustful or angry passions of their masters, and the same cruelties, the same indignities, were severely retaliated on the sons and daughters of the Romans.
(78) Operations of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war.
 A.
D.
 377 The imprudence of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> and his ministers had introduced into the heart of the empire a nation of enemies; but the <PRODUCT>Visigoths</PRODUCT> might even yet have been reconciled by the manly confession of past errors and the sincere performance of former engagements.
 These healing and temperate measures seemed to concur with the timorous disposition of the sovereign of the East: but on this occasion alone <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> was brave; and his unseasonable bravery was fatal to himself and to his subjects.
 He declared his intention of marching from <GPE>Antioch</GPE> to Constantinople, to subdue this dangerous rebellion; and, as he was not ignorant of the difficulties of the enterprise, he solicited the assistance of his nephew, the emperor Gratian, who commanded all the forces of the West.
 The veteran troops were hastily recalled from the defence of Armenia, that important frontier was abandoned to the discretion of Sapor; and the immediate conduct of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war was intrusted, during the absence of Valens, to his lieutenants, <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> and Profuturus, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> generals who indulged themselves in a very false and favourable opinion of their own abilities.
 On their arrival in <LOC>Thrace</LOC> they were joined by Richomer, count of the domestics; and the auxiliaries of the <LOC>West</LOC> that marched under his banner were composed of the <NORP>Gallic</NORP> legions, reduced indeed by a spirit of desertion to the vain appearances of strength and numbers.
 In a council of war, which was influenced by pride rather than by reason, it as resolved to seek and to encounter the barbarians, who lay encamped in the spacious and fertile meadows near the most southern of the mouths of the Danube.
(79) Their camp was surrounded by the usual fortification of wagons; (80) and the barbarians, secure within the vast circle of the enclosure, enjoyed the fruits of their valour and the spoils of the province.
 In the midst of riotous intemperance, the watchful <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> observed the motions and penetrated the designs of the Romans.
 He perceived that the numbers of the enemy were continually increasing; and, as he understood their intention of attacking his rear as soon as the scarcity of forage should oblige him to remove his camp, he recalled to their standard his predatory detachments, which covered the adjacent country.
 As soon as they descried the flaming beacons,(81) they obeyed with incredible speed the signal of their leader; the camp was filled with the martial crowd of barbarians; their impatient clamours demanded the battle, and their tumultuous zeal was approved and animated by the spirit of their chiefs.
 The evening was already far advanced; and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies prepared themselves for the approaching combat, which was deferred only till the dawn of day.
 While the trumpets sounded to arms, the undaunted courage of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was confirmed by the mutual obligation of a solemn oath; and, as they advanced to meet the enemy, the rude songs which celebrated the glory of their forefathers were mingled with their fierce and dissonant outcries, and opposed to the artificial harmony of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> shout.
 Some military skill was displayed by <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> to gain the advantage of a commanding eminence; but the bloody conflict, which began and ended with the light, was maintained on either side by the personal and obstinate efforts of strength, valour, and agility.
 The legions of <GPE>Armenia</GPE> supported their fame in arms, but they were oppressed by the irresistible weight of the hostile multitude: the left wing of he <NORP>Romans</NORP> was thrown into disorder, and the field was strewed with their mangled carcasses.
 This partial defeat was balanced, however, by partial success; and when the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies, at a late hour of the evening, retreated to their respective camps, neither of them could claim the honours of the effects of a decisive victory.
 The real loss was more severely felt by the Romans, in proportion to the smallness of their numbers; but the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were so deeply confounded and dismayed by this vigorous, and perhaps unexpected, resistance, that they remained seven days within the circle of their fortifications.
 Such funeral rites as the circumstances of time and place would admit were piously discharged to some officers of distinguished rank; but the indiscriminate vulgar was left unburied on the plain.
 Their flesh was greedily devoured by the birds of prey, who in that age enjoyed very frequent and delicious feasts; and, several <DATE>years</DATE> afterwards, the white and naked bones which covered the wide extent of the fields presented to the eyes of <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> a dreadful monument of the battle of Salices.
(82) Union of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> with the Huns, <NORP>Alani</NORP> etc.
 The progress of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had been checked by the doubtful event of that bloody day; and the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> generals, whose army would have been consumed by the repetition of such a contest, embraced the more rational plan of destroying the barbarians by the wants and pressure of their own multitudes.
 They prepared to confine the <PRODUCT>Visigoths</PRODUCT> in the narrow angle of land between the Danube, the desert of Scythia, and the mountains of Haemus, till their strength and spirit should be insensibly wasted by the inevitable operation of famine.
 The design was prosecuted with some conduct and success; the barbarians had almost exhausted their own magazines and the harvests of the country; and the diligence of Saturninus, the master-general of the cavalry, was employed to improve the strength and to contract the extent of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> fortifications.
 His labours were interrupted by the alarming intelligence that new swarms of barbarians had passed the unguarded Danube, either to support the cause or to imitate the example of Fritigern.
 The just apprehension that he himself might be surrounded and overwhelmed by the arms of hostile and unknown nations, compelled <NORP>Saturninus</NORP> to relinquish the siege of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; and the indignant Visigoths, breaking from their confinement, satiated their hunger and revenge by the repeated devastation of the fruitful country which extends above <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred miles from the banks of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> to the straits of the Hellespont.
 (83) The sagacious <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> had successfully appealed to the passions as well as to the interest of his barbarian allies; and the love of rapine and the hatred of <GPE>Rome</GPE> seconded, or even prevented, the eloquence of his ambassadors.
 He cemented a strict and useful alliance with the great body of his countrymen who obeyed <PERSON>Alatheus</PERSON> and <PERSON>Saphrax</PERSON> as the guardians of their infant king: the long animosity of rival tribes was suspended by the sense of their common interest; the independent part of the nation was associated under <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> standard; and the chiefs of the <PRODUCT>Ostrogoths</PRODUCT> appear to have yielded to the superior genius of the general of the Visigoths.
 He obtained the formidable aid of the Taifalae, whose military renown was disgraced and polluted by the public infamy of their domestic manners.
 Every youth, on his entrance into the world, was united by the ties of honourable friendship and brutal love to some warrior of the tribe; nor could he hope to be released from this unnatural connection till he had approved his manhood by slaying in single combat a huge bear or a wild boar of the forest.
 (84) But the most powerful auxiliaries of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were drawn from the camp of those enemies who had expelled them from their native seats.
 The loose subordination and extensive possessions of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> and the <NORP>Alani</NORP> delayed the conquests and distracted the councils of that victorious people.
 Several of the hordes were allured by the liberal promises of Fritigern; and the rapid cavalry of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> added weight and energy to the steady and strenuous efforts of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> infantry.
 The Sarmatians, who could never forgive the successor of Valentinian, enjoyed and increased the general confusion; and a seasonable irruption of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> into the provinces of <GPE>Gaul</GPE> engaged the attention and diverted the forces of the emperor of the West.
(85) Victory of <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> over the Alemani, A.
D.
 378.
 May.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the most dangerous inconveniences of the introduction of the barbarians into the army and the palace was sensibly felt in their correspondence with their hostile countrymen, to whom they imprudently or maliciously revealed the weakness of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 A soldier of the lifeguards of <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> was of the nation of the Alemanni, and of the tribe of the Lentienses, who dwelt beyond the lake of Constance.
 Some domestic business obliged him to request a leave of absence.
 In a short visit to his family and friends he was exposed to their curious inquiries, and the vanity of the loquacious soldier tempted him to display his intimate acquaintance with the secrets of the state and the designs of his master.
 The intelligence that <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> was preparing to lead the military force of <GPE>Gaul</GPE> and of the <LOC>West</LOC> to the assistance of his uncle Valens, pointed out to the restless spirit of the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> the moment and the mode of a successful invasion.
 The enterprise of some light detachments, who in the month of February passed the <LOC>Rhine</LOC> upon the ice, was the prelude of a more important war.
 The boldest hopes of rapine, perhaps of conquest, outweighed the considerations of timid prudence or national faith.
 Every forest and every village poured forth a band of hardy adventurers; and the great army of the Alemanni, which on their approach was estimated at forty thousand men by the fears of the people, was afterwards magnified to the number of Seventy thousand by the vain and credulous flattery of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court.
 The legions which had been ordered to march into <LOC>Pannonia</LOC> were immediately recalled or detained for the defence of Gaul; the military command was divided between <NORP>Nanienus</NORP> and Mellobaudes; and the youthful emperor, though he respected the long experience and sober wisdom of the former, was much more inclined to admire and to follow the martial ardour of his colleague, who was allowed to unite the incompatible characters of count of the domestics and of king of the Franks.
 His rival Priarius, king of the Alemanni, was guided, or rather impelled, by the same headstrong valour; and as their troops were animated by the spirit of their leaders, they met, they saw, they encountered each other near the town of Argentaria, or Colmar,(86) in the plains of Alsace.
 The glory of the day was justly ascribed to the missile weapons and well-practised evolutions of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> soldiers: the Alemanni, who long maintained their ground, were slaughtered with unrelenting fury: five thousand only of the barbarians escaped to the woods and mountains; and the glorious death of their king on the field of battle saved him from the reproaches of the people, who are always disposed to accuse the justice or policy of an unsuccessful war.
 After this signal victory, which secured the peace of <GPE>Gaul</GPE> and asserted the honour of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms, the emperor <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> appeared to proceed without delay on his <NORP>Eastern</NORP> expedition; but, as he approached the confines of the Alemanni, he suddenly inclined to the left, surprised them by his unexpected passage of the Rhine, and boldly advanced into the heart of their country.
 The barbarians opposed to his progress the obstacles of nature and of courage; and still continued to retreat from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> hill to another till they were satisfied, by repeated trials, of the power and perseverance of their enemies.
 Their submission was accepted as a proof, not indeed of their sincere repentance, but of their actual distress; and a select number of their brave and robust youth was exacted from the faithless nation, as the most substantial pledge of their future moderation.
 The subjects of the empire, who had so often experienced that the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> could neither be subdued by arms nor restrained by treaties, might not promise themselves any solid or lasting tranquillity; but they discovered, in the virtues of their young sovereign, the prospect of a long and auspicious reign.
 When the legions climbed the mountains and scaled the fortifications of the barbarians, the valour of <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> was distinguished in the foremost ranks: and the gilt and variegated armour of his guards was pierced and shattered by the blows which they had received in their constant attachment to the person of their sovereign.
 At the age of nineteen the son of <NORP>Valentinian</NORP> seemed to possess the talents of peace and war; and his personal success against the <PERSON>Alemanni</PERSON> was interpreted as a sure presage of his <NORP>Gothic</NORP> triumphs.
(87) <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> marches against the Goths, A.
D.
 378.
 <DATE>May</DATE> 30th—June 11th.
 While <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> deserved and enjoyed the applause of his subjects, the emperor Valens, who at length had removed his court and army from Antioch, was received by the people of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> as the author of the public calamity.
 Before he had reposed himself ten days in the capital he was urged by the licentious clamours of the <FAC>Hippodrome</FAC> to march against the barbarians whom he had invited into his dominions: and the citizens, who are always brave at a distance from any real danger, declared, with confidence, that if they were supplied with arms, they alone would undertake to deliver the province from the ravages of an insulting foe.
 (88) The vain reproaches of an ignorant multitude hastened the downfall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire; they provoked the desperate rashness of Valens, who did not find, either in his reputation or in his mind, any motives to support with firmness the public contempt.
 He was soon persuaded by the successful achievements of his lieutenants to despise the power of the Goths, who, by the diligence of Fritigern, were now collected in the neighbourhood of Hadrianople.
 The march of the <NORP>Taifalae</NORP> had been intercepted by the valiant Frigerid; the king of those licentious barbarians was slain in battle; and the suppliant captives were sent into distant exile to cultivate the lands of Italy, which were assigned for their settlement in the vacant territories of <GPE>Modena</GPE> and Parma.
(89) The exploits of Sebastian,(90) who was recently engaged in the service of Valens, and promoted to the rank of master-general of the infantry, were still more honourable to himself, and useful to the republic.
 He obtained the permission of selecting <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred soldiers from each of the legions, and this separate detachment soon acquired the spirit of discipline and the exercise of arms, which were almost forgotten under the reign of Valens.
 By the vigour and conduct of Sebastian, a large body of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was surprised in their camp; and the immense spoil which was recovered from their hands filled the city of <ORG>Hadrianople</ORG> and the adjacent plain.
 The splendid narratives which he general transmitted of his own exploits alarmed the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court by the appearance of superior merit; and though he cautiously insisted on the difficulties of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war, his valour was praised, his advice was rejected; and Valens, who listened with pride and pleasure to the flattering suggestions of the eunuchs of the palace, was impatient to seize the glory of all easy and assured conquest.
 His army was strengthened by a numerous reinforcement of veterans; and his march from <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to <ORG>Hadrianople</ORG> was conducted with so much military skill that he prevented the activity of the barbarians, who designed to occupy the intermediate defiles, and to intercept either the troops themselves or their convoys of provisions.
 The camp of Valens, which he pitched under the walls of Hadrianople, was fortified, according to the practice of the Romans, with a ditch and rampart; and a most important council was summoned to decide the fate of the emperor and of the empire.
 The party of reason and of delay was strenuously maintained by Victor, who had corrected, by the lessons of experience, the native fierceness of the <NORP>Sarmatian</NORP> character; while <PERSON>Sebastian</PERSON> with the flexible and obsequious eloquence of a courtier, represented every precaution and every measure that implied a doubt of immediate victory as unworthy of the courage and majesty of their invincible monarch.
 The ruin of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> was precipitated by the deceitful arts of <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> and the prudent admonitions of the emperor of the West.
 The advantages of negotiating in the midst of war were perfectly understood by the general of the barbarians; and a <NORP>Christian</NORP> ecclesiastic was despatched, as the holy minister of peace, to penetrate and to perplex the councils of the enemy.
 The misfortunes, as well as the provocations, of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation were forcibly and truly described by their ambassador, who protested, in the name of Fritigern, that he was still disposed to lay down his arms, or to employ them only in the defence of the empire, if he could secure for his wandering countrymen a tranquil settlement on the waste lands of Thrace, and a sufficient allowance of corn and cattle.
 But he added, in a whisper of confidential friendship, that the exasperated barbarians were averse to these reasonable conditions; and that <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> was doubtful whether he could accomplish the conclusion of the treaty unless he found himself supported by the presence and terrors of an <ORG>Imperial</ORG> army.
 About the same time, Count <PERSON>Richomer</PERSON> returned from the <LOC>West</LOC> to announce the defeat and submission of the Alemanni; to inform <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> that his nephew advanced by rapid marches at the head of the veteran and victorious legions of Gaul; and to request, in the name of <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> and of the republic, that every dangerous and decisive measure might be suspended till the junction of the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> emperors should ensure the success of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war.
 But the feeble sovereign of the <LOC>East</LOC> was actuated only by the fatal illusions of pride and jealousy.
 He disdained the importunate advice; he rejected the humiliating aid; he secretly compared the ignominious, at least the inglorious, period of his own reign with the fame of a beardless youth; and <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> rushed into the field to erect his imaginary trophy before the diligence of his colleague could usurp any share of the triumphs of the day.
 Battle of Hadrianople, A.
D.
 378.
 August 9th .
 On the ninth of August, a day which has deserved to be marked among the most inauspicious of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> calendar,(91) the emperor Valens, leaving, under a strong guard, his baggage and military treasure, marched from <ORG>Hadrianople</ORG> to attack the Goths, who were encamped about twelve miles from the city.
(92) By some mistake of the orders, or some ignorance of the ground, the right wing or column of cavalry arrived in sight of the enemy whilst the left was still at a considerable distance; the soldiers were compelled, in the sultry heat of summer, to precipitate their pace; and the line of battle was formed with tedious confusion and irregular delay.
 The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> cavalry had been detached to forage in the adjacent country; and <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> still continued to practise his customary arts.
 He despatched messengers of peace, made proposals, required hostages, and wasted the hours, till the Romans, exposed without shelter to the burning rays of the sun, were exhausted by thirst, hunger, and intolerable fatigue.
 The emperor was persuaded to send an ambassador to the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp; the zeal of Richomer, who alone had courage to accept the dangerous commission, was applauded; and the count of the domestics, adorned with the splendid ensigns of his dignity, had proceeded some way in the space between the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> armies when he was suddenly recalled by the alarm of battle.
 The hasty and imprudent attack was made by Bacurius the Iberian, who commanded a body of archers and targeteers: and, as they advanced with rashness, they retreated with loss and disgrace.
 In the same moment the flying squadrons of <PERSON>Alatheus</PERSON> and Saphrax, whose return was anxiously expected by the general of the Goths, descended like a whirlwind from the hills, swept across the plain, and added new terrors to the tumultuous but irresistible charge of the barbarian host.
 The defeat of the Romans.
 The event of the battle of Hadrianople, so fatal to <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> and to the empire, may be described in a few words: the <NORP>Roman</NORP> cavalry fled; the infantry was abandoned, surrounded, and cut in pieces.
 The most skilful evolutions, the firmest courage, are scarcely sufficient to extricate a body of foot encompassed on an open plain by superior numbers of horse; but the troops of Valens, oppressed by the weight of the enemy and their own fears, were crowded into a narrow space, where it was impossible for them to extend their ranks, or even to use, with effect, their swords and javelins.
 In the midst of tumult, of slaughter, and of dismay, the emperor, deserted by his guards, and wounded, as it was supposed, with an arrow, sought protection among the <PERSON>Lancearii</PERSON> and the Mattiarii, who still maintained their ground with some appearance of order and firmness.
 His faithful generals, <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> and Victor, who perceived his danger, loudly exclaimed that all was lost unless the person of the emperor could be saved.
 Some troops, animated by their exhortation, advanced to his relief: they found only a bloody spot, covered with a heap of broken arms and mangled bodies, without being able to discover their unfortunate prince either among the living or the dead.
 Death of the emperor Valens.
 Their search could not indeed be successful, if there is any truth in the circumstances with which some historians have related the death of the emperor.
 By the care of his attendants, <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> was removed from the field of battle to a neighbouring cottage, where they attempted to dress his wound and to provide for his future safety.
 But this humble retreat was instantly surrounded by the enemy; they tried to force the door; they were provoked by a discharge of arrows from the roof; till at length, impatient of delay, they set fire to a pile of dry faggots, and consumed the cottage with the <NORP>Roman</NORP> emperor and his train.
 <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> perished in the flames; and a youth, who dropped from the window, alone escaped, to attest the melancholy tale and to inform the <NORP>Goths</NORP> of the inestimable prize which they had lost by their own rashness.
 A great number of brave and distinguished officers perished in the battle of Hadrianople, which equalled in the actual loss, and far surpassed in the fatal consequences, the misfortune which <GPE>Rome</GPE> had formerly sustained in the fields of Cannae.
 (93) <CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> master-generals of the cavalry and infantry, <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great officers of the palace, and <CARDINAL>thirty-five</CARDINAL> tribunes, were found among the slain; and the death of <PERSON>Sebastian</PERSON> might satisfy the world that he was the victim as well as the author of the public calamity.
 Above two-thirds of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army were destroyed: and the darkness of the <TIME>night</TIME> was esteemed a very favourable circumstance, as it served to conceal the flight of the multitude, and to protect the more orderly retreat of <PERSON>Victor</PERSON> and Richomer, who alone, amidst the general consternation, maintained the advantage of calm courage and regular discipline.
(94) Funeral oration of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> and his army.
 While the impressions of grief and terror were still recent in the minds of men, the most celebrated rhetorician of the age composed the funeral oration of a vanquished army and of an unpopular prince, whose throne was already occupied by a stranger.
 The truth of history may disclaim some parts of this panegyric, which cannot strictly be reconciled with the character of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> or the circumstances of the battle; but the fairest commendation is due to the eloquence, and still more to the generosity, of the sophist of Antioch.
 (95) The <NORP>Goths</NORP> beseige Hadrianople.
 The pride of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was elated by this memorable victory; but their avarice was disappointed by the mortifying discovery that the richest part of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> spoil had been within the walls of Hadrianople.
 They hastened to possess the reward of their valour; but they were encountered by the remains of a vanquished army with an intrepid resolution, which was the effect of their despair and the only hope of their safety.
 The walls of the city and the ramparts of the adjacent camp were lined with military engines that threw stones of an enormous weight, and astonished the ignorant barbarians by the noise and velocity, still more than by the real effects, of the discharge.
 The soldiers, the citizens, the provincials, the domestics of the palace, were united in the danger and in the defence; the furious assault of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> was repulsed; their secret arts of treachery and treason were discovered; and after an obstinate conflict of many hours they retired to their tents, convinced by experience that it would be far more advisable to observe the treaty which their sagacious leader had tacitly stipulated with the fortifications of great and populous cities.
 After the hasty and impolitic massacre of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> hundred deserters, an act of justice extremely useful to the discipline of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> armies, the <NORP>Goths</NORP> indignantly raised the siege of Hadrianople.
 The scene of war and tumult was instantly converted into a silent solitude; the multitude suddenly disappeared; the secret paths of the woods and mountains were marked with the footsteps of the trembling fugitives, who sought a refuge in the distant cities of <GPE>Illyricum</GPE> and Macedonia; and the faithful officers of the household and the treasury cautiously proceeded in search of the emperor, of whose death they were still ignorant.
 The tide of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> inundation rolled from the walls of <ORG>Hadrianople</ORG> to the suburbs of Constantinople.
 The barbarians were surprised with the splendid appearance of the capital of the East, the height and extent of the walls, the myriads of wealthy and affrighted citizens who crowded the ramparts, and the various prospect of the sea and land.
 While they gazed with hopeless desire on the inaccessible beauties of Constantinople, a sally was made from <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the gates by a party of Saracens, (96) who had been fortunately engaged in the service of Valens.
 The cavalry of <NORP>Scythia</NORP> was forced to yield to the admirable swiftness and spirit of the <NORP>Arabian</NORP> horses; their riders were skilled in the evolutions of irregular war; and the Northern barbarians were astonished and dismayed by the inhuman ferocity of the barbarians of the South.
 A <NORP>Gothic</NORP> soldier was slain by the dagger of an Arab, and the hairy, naked savage, applying his lips to the wound, expressed a horrid delight while he sucked the blood of his vanquished enemy.
 (97) The army of the Goths, laden with the spoils of the wealthy suburbs and the adjacent territory, slowly moved from the <LOC>Bosphorus</LOC> to the mountains which form the western boundary of Thrace.
 The important pass of <PERSON>Succi</PERSON> was betrayed by the fear or the misconduct of Maurus; and the barbarians, who no longer had any resistance to apprehend from the scattered and vanquished troops of the East, spread themselves over the face of a fertile and cultivated country, as far as the confines of <GPE>Italy</GPE> and the <NORP>Hadriatic</NORP> Sea.
(98) They ravage the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces, A.
D.
 378,379.
 The Romans, who so coolly and so concisely mention the acts of justice which were exercised by the legions,(99) reserved their compassion and their eloquence for their own sufferings when the provinces were invaded and desolated by the arms of the successful barbarians.
 The simple circumstantial narrative (did such a narrative exist) of the ruin of a single town, of the misfortunes of a single family,(100) might exhibit an interesting and instructive picture of human manners; but the tedious repetition of vague and declamatory complaints would fatigue the attention of the most patient reader.
 The same censure may be applied, though not perhaps in an equal degree, to the profane and the ecclesiastical writers of this unhappy period; that their minds were inflamed by popular and religious animosity, and that the true size and colour of every object is falsified by the exaggerations of their corrupt eloquence.
 The vehement <PERSON>Jerom</PERSON> (101) might justly deplore the calamities inflicted by the <NORP>Goths</NORP> and their barbarous allies on his native country of Pannonia, and the wide extent of the provinces from the walls of Constantinople, to the foot of the Julian Alps; the rapes, the massacres, the conflagrations, and, above all, the profanation of the churches that were turned into stables, and the contemptuous treatment of the relics of holy martyrs.
 But the saint is surely transported beyond the limits of nature and history when he affirms; These complaints were pronounced about <CARDINAL>twenty</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> after the death of Valens; and the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> provinces, which were constantly exposed to the invasion and passage of the barbarians, still continued, after a calamitous period of ten centuries, to supply new materials for rapine and destruction.
 Could it even be supposed that a large tract of country had been left without cultivation and without inhabitants, the consequences might not have been so fatal to the inferior productions of animated nature.
 The useful and feeble animals, which are nourished by the hand of man, might suffer and perish if they were deprived of his protection; but the beasts of the forest, his enemies or his victims, would multiply in the free and undisturbed possession of their solitary domain.
 The various tribes that peopled the air or the waters are still less connected with the fate of the human species; and it is highly probable that the fish of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> would have felt more terror and distress from the approach of a voracious pike than from the hostile inroad of a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> army.
 Massacre of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> youth in Asia, A.
D.
 378.
 Whatever may have been the just measure of the calamities of Europe, there was reason to fear that the same calamities would soon extend to the peaceful countries of Asia.
 The sons of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had been judiciously distributed through the cities of the East, and the arts of education were employed to polish and subdue the native fierceness of their temper.
 In the space of about twelve <DATE>years</DATE> their numbers had continually increased; and the children who in the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> emigration were sent over the <LOC>Hellespont</LOC> had attained with rapid growth the strength and spirit of perfect manhood.
(102) It was impossible to conceal from their knowledge the events of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war; and, as those daring youths had not studied the language of dissimulation, they betrayed their wish, their desire, perhaps their intentions to emulate the glorious example of their fathers The danger of the times seemed to justify the jealous suspicions of the provincials; and these suspicions were admitted as unquestionable evidence that the <NORP>Goths</NORP> of <LOC>Asia</LOC> had formed a secret and dangerous conspiracy against the public safety.
 The death of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> had left the <LOC>East</LOC> without a sovereign; and Julius, who filled the important station of master-general of the troops, with a high reputation of diligence and ability, thought it his duty to consult the senate of Constantinople, which he considered, during the vacancy of the throne, as the representative council of the nation.
 As soon as he had obtained the discretionary power of acting as he should judge most expedient for the good of the republic, he assembled the principal officers and privately concerted effectual measures for the execution of his bloody design.
 An order was immediately promulgated that, on a stated day, the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> youth should assemble in the capital cities of their respective provinces; and, as a report was industriously circulated that they were summoned to receive a liberal gift of lands and money, the pleasing hope allayed the fury of their resentment, and perhaps suspended the motions of the conspiracy.
 On the appointed day the unarmed crowd of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> youth was carefully collected in the square or forum; the streets and avenues were occupied by the <NORP>Roman</NORP> troops, and the roofs of the houses were covered with archers and slingers.
 At the same hour, in all the cities of the East, the signal was given of indiscriminate slaughter; and the provinces of <LOC>Asia</LOC> were delivered, by the cruel prudence of Julius, from a domestic enemy, who in a few months might have carried fire and sword from the <LOC>Hellespont</LOC> to the Euphrates.
(103) The urgent consideration of the public safety may undoubtedly authorise the violation of every positive law.
 How far that or any other consideration may operate to dissolve the natural obligations of humanity and justice, is a doctrine of which I still desire to remain ignorant.
 The emperor <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> invests <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> with the empire of the East, A.
D.
 379, January 19.
 The emperor <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> was far advanced on his march towards the plains of <ORG>Hadrianople</ORG> when he was informed, at <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> by the confused voice of fame, and afterwards by the more accurate reports of <PERSON>Victor</PERSON> and Richomer, that his impatient colleague had been slain in battle, and that two-thirds of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> army were exterminated by the sword of the victorious Goths.
 Whatever resentment the rash and jealous vanity of his uncle might deserve, the resentment of a generous mind is easily subdued by the softer emotions of grief and compassion; and even the sense of pity was soon lost in the serious and alarming consideration of the state of the republic.
 <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> was too late to assist, he was too weak to revenge, his unfortunate colleague; and the valiant and modest youth felt himself unequal to the support of a sinking world.
 A formidable tempest of the barbarians of <GPE>Germany</GPE> seemed ready to burst over the provinces of Gaul, and the mind of <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> was oppressed and distracted by the administration of the <NORP>Western</NORP> empire.
 In this important crisis the government of the <LOC>East</LOC> and the conduct of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war required the undivided attention of a hero and a statesman.
 A subject invested with such ample command would not long have preserved his fidelity to a distant benefactor; and the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> council embraced the wise and manly resolution of conferring an obligation rather than of yielding to an insult.
 It was the wish of <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> to bestow the purple as the reward of virtue; but at the age of nineteen it is not easy for a prince, educated in the supreme rank, to understand the true characters of his ministers and generals.
 He attempted to weigh, with an impartial hand, their various merits and defects; and whilst he checked the rash confidence of ambition, he distrusted the cautious wisdom which despaired of the republic.
 As each moment of delay diminished something of the power and resources of the future sovereign of the East, the situation of the times would not allow a tedious debate.
 The choice of <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> was soon declared in favour of an exile, whose father, only <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> <DATE>years</DATE> before, had suffered, under the sanction of his authority, an unjust and ignominious death.
 The great Theodosius, a name celebrated in history and dear to the <NORP>Catholic</NORP> church, (104) was summoned to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court, which had gradually retreated from the confines of <LOC>Thrace</LOC> to the more secure station of Sirmium.
 Five months after the death of <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> the emperor <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> produced before the assembled troops his colleague and their master, who, after a modest, perhaps a sincere resistance, was compelled to accept, amidst the general acclamations, the diadem, the purple, and the equal title of Augustus.
(105) The provinces of Thrace, Asia, and Egypt, over which <PERSON>Valens</PERSON> had reigned, were resigned to the administration of the new emperor; but as he was specially intrusted with the conduct of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war, the <NORP>Illyrian</NORP> praefecture was dismembered, and the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> great dioceses of <GPE>Dacia</GPE> and <GPE>Macedonia</GPE> were added to the dominions of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire.
 (106) Birth and character of Theodosius.
 The same province, and perhaps the same city,(107) which had given to the throne the virtues of <PERSON>Trajan</PERSON> and the talents of Hadrian, was the original seat of another family of Spaniards, who, in a less fortunate age, possessed, near fourscore years, the declining empire of Rome.
 (108) They emerged from the obscurity of municipal honours by the active spirit of the elder Theodosius, a general whose exploits in <GPE>Britain</GPE> and <LOC>Africa</LOC> have formed <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the most splendid parts of the annals of Valentinian.
 The son of that general, who likewise bore the name of Theodosius, was educated, by skilful preceptors, in the liberal studies of youth; but he was instructed in the art of war by the tender care and severe discipline of his father.
 (109) Under the standard of such a leader, young <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> sought glory and knowledge in the most distant scenes of military action; inured his constitution to the difference of seasons and climates; distinguished his valour by sea and land; and observed the various warfare of the Scots, the Saxons, and the Moors.
 His own merit, and the recommendation of the conqueror of Africa, soon raised him to a separate command; and, in the station of duke of Mazsia, he vanquished an army of Sarmatians; saved the province; deserved the love of the soldiers; and provoked the envy of the court.
(110) His rising fortunes were soon blasted by the disgrace and execution of his illustrious father; and <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> obtained, as a favour, the permission of retiring to a private life in his native province of Spain.
 He displayed a firm and temperate character in the ease with which he adapted himself to this new situation.
 His time was almost equally divided between the town and country; the spirit which had animated his public conduct was shown in the active and affectionate performance of every social duty; and the diligence of the soldier was profitably converted to the improvement of his ample patrimony, (111) which lay between <GPE>Valladolid</GPE> and Segovia, in the midst of a fruitful district, still famous for a most exquisite breed of sheep.
(112) From the innocent, but humble, labours of his farm, <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> was transported, in less than <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> months, to the throne of the <NORP>Eastern</NORP> empire: and the whole period of the history of the world will not perhaps afford a similar example of an elevation at the same time so pure and so honourable.
 The princes who peaceably inherit the sceptre of their fathers claim and enjoy a legal right, the more secure as it is absolutely distinct from the merits of their personal characters.
 The subjects who, in a monarchy or a popular state, acquire the possession of supreme power, may have raised themselves, by the superiority either of genius or virtue, above the heads of their equals: but their virtue is seldom exempt from ambition; and the cause of the successful candidate is frequently stained by the guilt of conspiracy or civil war.
 Even in those governments which allow the reigning monarch to declare a colleague or a successor, his partial choice, which may be influenced by the blindest passions, is often directed to an unworthy object.
 But the most suspicious malignity cannot ascribe to Theodosius, in his obscure solitude of Caucha, the arts, the desires, or even the hopes of an ambitious statesman; and the name of the <EVENT>Exile</EVENT> would long since have been forgotten, if his genuine and distinguished virtues had not left a deep impression in the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court.
 During the season of prosperity he had been neglected; but, in the public distress, his superior merit was universally felt and acknowledged.
 What confidence must have been reposed in his integrity, since <PERSON>Gratian</PERSON> could trust that a pious son would forgive, for the sake of the republic, the murder of his father! What expectations must have been formed of his abilities, to encourage the hope that a single man could save, and restore, the empire of the East! <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> was invested with the purple in the thirty-third year of his age.
 The vulgar gazed with admiration on the manly beauty of his face and the graceful majesty of his person, which they were pleased to compare with the pictures and medals of the emperor Trajan; whilst intelligent observers discovered, in the qualities of his heart and understanding, a more important resemblance to the best and greatest of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> princes.
 His prudent and successful conduct of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> war, A.
D.
 379-382.
 It is not without the most sincere regret that I must now take leave of an accurate and faithful guide, who has composed the history of his own times without indulging the prejudices and passions which usually affect the mind of a contemporary.
 <PERSON>Ammianus</PERSON> Marcellinus, who terminates his useful work with the defeat and death of Valens, recommends the more glorious subject of the ensuing reign to the youthful vigour and eloquence of the rising generation.
(113) The rising generation was not disposed to accept his advice, or to imitate his example; (114) and, in the study of the reign of Theodosius, we are reduced to illustrate the partial narrative of <PERSON>Zosimus</PERSON> by the obscure hints of fragments and chronicles, by the figurative style of poetry or panegyric, and by the precarious assistance of the ecclesiastical writers, who, in the heat of religious faction, are apt to despise the profane virtues of sincerity and moderation.
 Conscious of these disadvantages, which will continue to involve a considerable portion of the decline and fall of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire, I shall proceed with doubtful and timorous steps.
 Yet I may boldly pronounce that the battle of <ORG>Hadrianople</ORG> was never revenged by any signal or decisive victory of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> over the barbarians; and the expressive silence of his venal orators may be confirmed by the observation of the condition and circumstances of the times.
 The fabric of a mighty state, which has been reared by the labours of successive ages, could not be overturned by the misfortune of a single day, if the fatal power of the imagination did not exaggerate the real measure of the calamity.
 The loss of forty thousand Romans, who fell in the plains of Hadrianople, might have been soon recruited in the populous provinces of the East, which contained so many millions of inhabitants.
 The courage of a soldier is found to be the cheapest and most common quality of human nature; and sufficient skill to encounter an undisciplined foe might have been speedily taught by the care of the surviving centurions.
 If the barbarians were mounted on the horses, and equipped with the armour, of their vanquished enemies, the numerous studs of <GPE>Cappadocia</GPE> and <GPE>Spain</GPE> would have supplied new squadrons of cavalry; the <CARDINAL>thirty-four</CARDINAL> arsenals of the empire were plentifully stored with magazines of offensive and defensive arms; and the wealth of <LOC>Asia</LOC> might still have yielded an ample fund for the expenses of the war.
 But the effects which were produced by the battle of <ORG>Hadrianople</ORG> on the minds of the barbarians and of the Romans, extended the victory of the former, and the defeat of the latter, far beyond the limits of a single day.
 A <NORP>Gothic</NORP> chief was heard to declare, with insolent moderation, that, for his own part, he was fatigued with slaughter; but that he was astonished how a people who fled before him like a flock of sheep could still presume to dispute the possession of their treasures and provinces.
(115) The same terrors which the name of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> had spread among the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> tribes were inspired, by the formidable name of the Goths, among the subjects and soldiers of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (116) If Theodosius, hastily collecting his scattered forces, had led them into the field to encounter a victorious enemy, his army would have been vanquished by their own fears; and his rashness could not have been excused by the chance of success.
 But the great Theodosius, an epithet which he honourably deserved on this momentous occasion, conducted himself as the firm and faithful guardian of the republic.
 He fixed his headquarters at Thessalonica, the capital of the <NORP>Macedonian</NORP> diocese; (117) from whence he could watch the irregular motions of the barbarians, and direct the operations of his lieutenants, from the gates of <GPE>Constantinople</GPE> to the shores of the Hadriatic.
 The fortifications and garrisons of the cities were strengthened; and the troops, among whom a sense of order and discipline was revived, were insensibly emboldened by the confidence of their own safety.
 From these secure stations they were encouraged to make frequent sallies on the barbarians, who infested the adjacent country; and, as they were seldom allowed to engage, without some decisive superiority, either of ground or of numbers, their enterprises were, for the most part, successful; and they were soon convinced, by their own experience, of the possibility of vanquishing their invincible enemies.
 The detachments of these separate garrisons were gradually united into small armies; the same cautious measures were pursued, according to an extensive and well-concerted plan of operations; the events of each day added strength and spirit to the <NORP>Roman</NORP> arms; and the artful diligence of the emperor, who circulated the most favourable reports of the success of the war, contributed to subdue the pride of the barbarians, and to animate the hopes and courage of his subjects.
 If, instead of this faint and imperfect outline, we could accurately represent the counsels and actions of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> in <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> successive campaigns, there is reason to believe that his consummate skill would deserve the applause of every military reader.
 The republic had formerly been saved by the delays of Fabius; and, while the splendid trophies of Scipio, in the field of Zama, attract the eyes of posterity, the camps and marches of the dictator among the hills of <GPE>Campania</GPE> may claim a juster proportion of the solid and independent fame which the general is not compelled to share either with fortune or with his troops.
 Such was likewise the merit of Theodosius; and the infirmities of his body, which most unseasonably languished under a long and dangerous disease, could not oppress the vigour of his mind, or divert his attention from the public service.
(118) Divisions defeat and submission, of the Goths, A.
D.
 379-382.
 The deliverance and peace of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> provinces(119) was the work of prudence, rather than of valour: the prudence of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> was seconded by fortune; and the emperor never failed to seize, and to improve, every favourable circumstance.
 As long as the superior genius of <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> preserved the union and directed the motions of the barbarians, their power was not inadequate to the conquest of a great empire.
 The death of that hero, the predecessor and master of the renowned Alaric, relieved an impatient multitude from the intolerable yoke of discipline and discretion.
 The barbarians, who had been restrained by his authority, abandoned themselves to the dictates of their passions; and their passions were seldom uniform or consistent.
 An army of conquerors was broken into many disorderly bands of savage robbers; and their blind and irregular fury was not less pernicious to themselves than to their enemies.
 Their mischievous disposition was shown in the destruction of every object which they wanted strength to remove, or taste to enjoy; and they often consumed, with improvident rage, the harvests, or the granaries, which soon afterwards became necessary for their own subsistence.
 A spirit of discord arose among the independent tribes and nations, which had been united only by the bands of a loose and voluntary alliance.
 The troops of the <NORP>Huns</NORP> and the <NORP>Alani</NORP> would naturally upbraid the flight of the Goths, who were not disposed to use with moderation the advantages of their fortune: the ancient jealousy of the <PRODUCT>Ostrogoths</PRODUCT> and the <PRODUCT>Visigoths</PRODUCT> could not long be suspended; and the haughty chiefs still remembered the insults and injuries which they had reciprocally offered or sustained while the nation was seated in the countries beyond the Danube.
 The progress of domestic faction abated the more diffusive sentiment of national animosity; and the officers of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> were instructed to purchase, with liberal gifts and promises, the retreat or service of the discontented party.
 The acquisition of Modar, a prince of the royal blood of the Amali, gave a bold and faithful champion to the cause of Rome.
 The illustrious deserter soon obtained the rank of master-general, with an important command; surprised an army of his countrymen, who were immersed in wine and sleep; and, after a cruel slaughter of the astonished Goths, returned with an immense spoil, and <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> thousand waggons, to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> camp.
(120) In the hands of a skilful politician the most different means may be successfully applied to the same ends; and the peace of the empire, which had been forwarded by the divisions, was accomplished by the reunion of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation.
 Death and funeral of Athanaric, A.
D.
 381, January 25.
 Athanaric, who had been a patient spectator of these extraordinary events, was at length driven, by the chance of arms, from the dark recesses of the woods of Caucaland.
 He no longer hesitated to pass the Danube; and a very considerable part of the subjects of <PERSON>Fritigern</PERSON> who already felt the inconveniences of anarchy, were easily persuaded to acknowledge for their king a <NORP>Gothic</NORP> Judge, whose birth they respected, and whose abilities they had frequently experienced.
 But age had chilled the daring spirit of Athanaric; and instead of leading his people to the field of battle and victory, he wisely listened to the fair proposal of an honourable and advantageous treaty.
 Theodosius, who was acquainted with the merit and power of his new ally, condescended to meet him at the distance of several miles from Constantinople; and entertained him in the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> city, with the confidence of a friend, and the magnificence of a monarch.
 (121) The <NORP>Gothic</NORP> king did not long enjoy this splendid and honourable reception; and, as temperance was not the virtue of his nation, it may justly be suspected that his mortal disease was contracted amidst the pleasures of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> banquets.
 But the policy of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> derived more solid benefit from the death than he could have expected from the most faithful services of his ally.
 The funeral of <PERSON>Athanaric</PERSON> was performed with solemn rites in the capital of the East; a stately monument was erected to his memory; and his whole army, won by the liberal courtesy and decent grief of Theodosius, enlisted under the standard of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 (122) The submission of so great a body of the <PRODUCT>Visigoths</PRODUCT> was productive of the most salutary consequences; and the mixed influence of force, of reason, and of corruption, became every day more powerful and more extensive.
 Each independent chieftain hastened to obtain a separate treaty, from the apprehension that an obstinate delay might expose him, alone and unprotected, to the revenge or justice, of the conqueror.
 The general, or rather the final, capitulation of the Goths, may be dated <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> month, and twenty-five days A.
D.
 382, <DATE>October</DATE> 3.
, after the defeat and death of the emperor Valens.
 (123) Invasion and defeat of the Gruthungi, or Ostrogoths, A.
D.
 386, October.
 The provinces of the <LOC>Danube</LOC> had been already relieved from the oppressive weight of the Gruthungi, or Ostrogoths, by the voluntary retreat of <PERSON>Alatheus</PERSON> and Saphrax, whose restless spirit had prompted them to seek new scenes of rapine and glory.
 Their destructive course was pointed towards the West; but we must be satisfied with a very obscure and imperfect knowledge of their various adventures.
 The <PRODUCT>Ostrogoths</PRODUCT> impelled several of the <NORP>German</NORP> tribes on the provinces of Gaul; concluded, and soon violated, a treaty with the emperor Gratian; advanced into the unknown countries of the North; and, after an interval of more than <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> years, returned with accumulated force to the banks of the Lower Danube.
 Their troops were recruited with the fiercest warriors of <GPE>Germany</GPE> and Scythia; and the soldiers, or at least the historians, of the empire no longer recognised the name and countenances of their former enemies.
(124) The general who commanded the military and naval powers of the <NORP>Thracian</NORP> frontier soon perceived that his superiority would be disadvantageous to the public service; and that the barbarians, awed by the presence of his fleet and legions, would probably defer the passage of the river till the approaching winter.
 The dexterity of the spies whom he sent into the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> camp allured the barbarians into a fatal snare.
 They were persuaded that, by a bold attempt, they might surprise, in the silence and darkness of the night, the sleeping army of the Romans; and the whole multitude was hastily embarked in a fleet of <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> thousand canoes.
(125) The bravest of the <PRODUCT>Ostrogoths</PRODUCT> led the van; the main body consisted of the remainder of their subjects and soldiers; and the women and children securely followed in the rear.
 <CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> of the nights without a moon had been selected for the execution of their design; and they had almost reached the southern bank of the Danube, in the firm confidence that they should find an easy landing and an unguarded camp.
 But the progress of the barbarians was suddenly stopped by an unexpected obstacle—a triple line of vessels, strongly connected with each other, and which formed an impenetrable chain of <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> miles and a half along the river.
 While they struggled to force their way in the unequal conflict, their right flank was overwhelmed by the irresistible attack of a fleet of galleys, which were urged down the stream by the united impulse of oars and of the tide.
 The weight and velocity of those ships of war broke, and sunk, and dispersed the rude and feeble canoes of the barbarians: their valour was ineffectual; and Alatheus, the king or general of the Ostrogoths, perished, with his bravest troops, either by the sword of the <NORP>Romans</NORP> or in the waves of the Danube.
 The last division of this unfortunate fleet might regain the opposite shore; but the distress and disorder of the multitude rendered them alike incapable either of action or counsel; and they soon implored the clemency of the victorious enemy.
 On this occasion, as well as on many others, it is a difficult task to reconcile the passions and prejudices of the writers of the age of Theodosius.
 The partial and malignant historian, who misrepresents every action of his reign, affirms that the emperor did not appear in the field of battle till the barbarians had been vanquished by the valour and conduct of his lieutenant Promotus.
 (126) The flattering poet, who celebrated in the court of <PERSON>Honorius</PERSON> the glory of the father and of the son, ascribes the victory to the personal prowess of Theodosius; and almost insinuates that the king of the <PRODUCT>Ostrogoths</PRODUCT> was slain by the hand of the emperor.
(127) The truth of history might perhaps be found in a just medium between these extreme and contradictory assertions.
 Settlement of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> in <LOC>Thrace</LOC> and Asia, A.
D.
 383-395.
 The original treaty, which fixed the settlement of the Goths, ascertained their privileges, and stipulated their obligations, would illustrate the history of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> and his successors.
 The series of their history has imperfectly preserved the spirit and substance of this singular agreement.
(128) The ravages of war and tyranny had provided many large tracts of fertile but uncultivated land for the use of those barbarians who might not disdain the practice of agriculture.
 A numerous colony of the <PRODUCT>Visigoths</PRODUCT> was seated in Thrace; the remains of the <PRODUCT>Ostrogoths</PRODUCT> were planted in <GPE>Phrygia</GPE> and Lydia; their immediate wants were supplied by a distribution of corn and cattle; and their future industry was encouraged by an exemption from tribute during a certain term of years.
 The barbarians would have deserved to feel the cruel and perfidious policy of the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> court if they had suffered themselves to be dispersed through the provinces.
 They required and they obtained the sole possession of the villages and districts assigned for their residence; they still cherished and propagated their native manners and language; asserted, in the bosom of despotism, the freedom of their domestic government; and acknowledged the sovereignty of the emperor, without submitting to the inferior jurisdiction of the laws and magistrates of Rome.
 The hereditary chiefs of the tribes and families were still permitted to command their followers in peace and war: but the royal dignity was abolished; and the generals of the <NORP>Goths</NORP> were appointed and removed at the pleasure of the emperor.
 An army of forty thousand <NORP>Goths</NORP> was maintained for the perpetual service of the empire of the East; and those haughty troops, who assumed the title of Foederati, or allies, were distinguished by their gold collars, liberal pay, and licentious privileges.
 Their native courage was improved by the use of arms and the knowledge of discipline; and, while the republic was guarded or threatened by the doubtful sword of the barbarians, the last sparks of the military flame were finally extinguished in the minds of the Romans.
(129) <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> had the address to persuade his allies that the conditions of peace, which had been extorted from him by prudence and necessity, were the voluntary expressions of his sincere friendship for the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> nation.
 (130) A different mode of vindication or apology was opposed to the complaints of the people, who loudly censured these shameful and dangerous concessions.
 (131) The calamities of the War were painted in the most lively colours; and the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> symptoms of the return of order, of plenty, and security were diligently exaggerated.
 The advocates of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> could affirm, with some appearance of truth and reason, that it was impossible to extirpate so many warlike tribes, who were rendered desperate by the loss of their native country; and that the exhausted provinces would be revived by a fresh supply of soldiers and husbandmen.
 The barbarians still wore an angry and hostile aspect; but the experience of past times might encourage the hope that they would acquire the habits of industry and obedience; that their manners would be polished by time, education, and the influence of Christianity; and that their posterity would insensibly blend with the great body of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> people.
 (132) Their hostile sentiments.
 Notwithstanding these specious arguments and these sanguine expectations, it was apparent to every discerning eye that the <NORP>Goths</NORP> would long remain the enemies, and might soon become the conquerors, of the <NORP>Roman</NORP> empire.
 Their rude and insolent behaviour expressed their contempt of the citizens and provincials, whom they insulted with impunity.
(133) To the zeal and valour of the barbarians <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> was indebted for the success of his arms: but their assistance was precarious; and they were sometimes seduced, by a treacherous and inconstant disposition, to abandon his standard at the moment when their service was the most essential.
 During the civil war against <PERSON>Maximus</PERSON> a great number of <NORP>Gothic</NORP> deserters retired into the morasses of Macedonia, wasted the adjacent provinces, and obliged the intrepid monarch to expose his person and exert his power to suppress the rising flame of rebellion.
 (134) The public apprehensions were fortified by the strong suspicion that these tumults were not the effect of accidental passion, but the result of deep and premeditated design.
 It was generally believed that the <NORP>Goths</NORP> had signed the treaty of peace with an hostile and insidious spirit; and that their chiefs had previously bound themselves by a solemn and secret oath never to keep faith with the Romans, to maintain the fairest show of loyalty and friendship, and to watch the favourable moment of rapine, of conquest, and of revenge.
 But as the minds of the barbarians were not insensible to the power of gratitude, several of the <NORP>Gothic</NORP> leaders sincerely devoted themselves to the service of the empire, or, at least, of the emperor: the whole nation was insensibly divided into <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> opposite factions, and much sophistry was employed in conversation and dispute to compare the obligations of their <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> and <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> engagements.
 The <NORP>Goths</NORP> who considered themselves as the friends of peace, of justice, and of Rome, were directed by the authority of Fravitta, a valiant and honourable youth, distinguished above the rest of his countrymen by the politeness of his manners, the liberality of his sentiments, and the mild virtues of social life.
 But the more numerous faction adhered to the fierce and faithless Priulf, who inflamed the passions and asserted the independence of his warlike followers.
 On <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of the solemn festivals, when the chiefs of both parties were invited to the <ORG>Imperial</ORG> table, they were insensibly heated by wine, till they forgot the usual restraints of discretion and respect, and betrayed in the presence of <PERSON>Theodosius</PERSON> the fatal secret of their domestic disputes.
